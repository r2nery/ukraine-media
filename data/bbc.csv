Russia's invasion of Ukraine prompted the three former Soviet republics to submit emergency applications in the first weeks of the war. Ukraine's prospects look promising, and so do Moldova's. But Georgia was slapped with a scathing European Parliament resolution on Thursday, described by one MEP as the last ""wake-up call"" to the government in Tbilisi. Ukraine has led the way in arguing that joining the EU has become a geopolitical necessity, although the three states are known as the Association Trio for their co-operation with the EU on everything from political reforms to free trade. Addressing MEPs in Strasbourg earlier this month, Ukraine's parliament speaker Ruslan Stefanchyk said granting candidate status would empower the Ukrainian people, while ""any other signal would only benefit Russian President Vladimir Putin and his regime"". Moldova's pro-EU President, Maia Sandu, told Euro MPs last month that her country still had a long way to go. But she reminded them that many Moldovans could hear the bombs falling on the Ukrainian city of Odesa from their homes. In the run-up to the EU's decision, Brussels think-tank the Centre for European Studies published reports on Ukraine and Moldova's applications. It said Ukraine faced an existential crisis, while Moldova was ""next at risk"" from Russian aggression. It recommended that the EU should extend candidate status to both countries. That status far from guarantees entry to the EU, but does represent a significant step on the path. On Georgia, the report said the formal access process would be premature. Its economic reforms had surpassed both Ukraine and Moldova and other EU candidate states, it said. But on democracy, the government had contradicted ""the EU's fundamental values"". On Thursday the European Parliament backed a strongly worded resolution calling on Georgia to uphold the highest standards of democracy and rule of law. It said press freedom had been declining dramatically and condemned the intimidation and persecution of journalists. Last summer more than 50 media workers were hurt in far-right violence, but the government failed to prosecute any of the organisers. Instead it has launched criminal investigations into owners of independent media channels critical of the government. The head of Georgia's leading opposition Mtavari TV channel, Nika Gvaramia, was jailed last month for three and a half years, in what Amnesty International described as a ""blatant act of politically motivated prosecution"". ""I am a political prisoner and the timing of my imprisonment is deliberate,"" he wrote in a letter to the BBC delivered by his lawyers. Gvaramia, who was found guilty of misusing company funds, said his imprisonment was a message from the Georgian government ""aimed at the open and aggressive sabotage of Georgia's European future"". Georgia's government has rejected the criticism, describing Gvaramia as an opposition leader hiding behind journalism. The head of the ruling party added that the resolution from Brussels had nothing to do with European values. Prime Minister Irakli Gharibashvili said earlier this month he expected a ""wise decision from the European Union"". ""Let's be open and frank here. When Russia invaded Georgia in 2008 no-one in this world imposed sanctions."" That led to a sense of impunity in Moscow, he argued, prompting Russia's invasion of Crimea in 2014 and the launch of full-scale war against Ukraine in February. The prime minister said Georgia deserved as much recognition from the EU as Moldova and Ukraine: ""The answer from the West must be adequate, relevant: it must be proportional."" The EU has been encouraging the Georgian government to make good on promised reforms, in particular to build an independent judiciary. But the treatment of ex-President Mikheil Saakashvili and other opposition figures has raised alarm. Saakashvili, who was in power at the time of the Russian invasion of Georgia, was detained when he returned last year to back the opposition in elections. Both he and Nika Gvaramia say they are victims of a political vendetta by the country's sole oligarch, Bidzina Ivanishvili. Mr Ivanishvili, who made his fortune in Russia, founded the governing Georgian Dream Party in 2011. And while he is no longer chairman, his influence in politics remains a matter of concern for Brussels. A recent investigation by anti-corruption watchdog Transparency International Georgia alleged that Mr Ivanishvili may still have business interests in Russia. The European Parliament's resolution calls for the businessman to face EU sanctions, highlighting his personal and business links to the Kremlin. He denies being close to the Russian leadership. Like Ukrainians and Moldovans, Georgians are overwhelmingly in favour of EU membership according to opinion polls. The question is whether the EU would want to risk disappointing the majority of Georgians. President Salome Zourabichvili said in Brussels this week that European leaders had now recognised the ""true face of Russia"" - and the only answer was the European Union. "

It was the middle of March in Mala Rohan, a village near Kharkiv in eastern Ukraine, and the ground was frozen. The village was under occupation by the Russian army, so Vadym went out periodically from their shell-damaged house to dig in a far corner of the garden shaded by apricot and quince trees. After 45 years of marriage, 69-year-old Vadym, alone, lifted his wife Iryna into a makeshift casket, folded her hands over her chest, lowered her into the grave, covered the casket with a corrugated tin sheet, to protect her, and filled in her grave with earth. Six weeks later, in early June, a local prosecutor from the city of Kharkiv drove out to Mala Rohan with a small team to dig Iryna up. First, the team walked around and through the remains of Vadym's house, interviewing him and taking pictures of the place where the shell had hit. After the inspection of the house, Vadym led the prosecutor along a path through the garden to the grave. The team took photographs, soil samples, and detailed notes, and watched attentively as two volunteers began to dig. Now the sun was beating down on Mala Rohan and the earth came loose easily. When the casket was raised up and ready to be opened, Vadym, holding a picture of his wife pressed between his palms, ducked under the branches of the apricot tree and walked toward the house so he would not see. The local prosecutor, Maksym Klymovets, was at Vadym's house to help determine whether the Bobryntsevs were the victims of a war crime - a specialist field in which Klymovets and his colleagues had no experience until Russia invaded Ukraine, three months ago. Klymovets, who has cropped dark hair and a neatly-trimmed beard, was accompanied by two forensic police officers, another officer who took notes, two civilian witnesses drawn from the village - in accordance with Ukrainian law - and two local volunteers to dig the grave. ""This is totally new work for us,"" Klymovets said. ""We are learning on the job."" After about three hours, Klymovets declared the evidence-gathering complete for this visit and Iryna's casket was loaded into the back of a van to be transported to the morgue. Her death would be recorded as an alleged war crime - one of nearly 16,000 such cases now open across the country, including more than 1,000 in the Kharkiv region. There is no precedent for what is happening now in Ukraine - a large-scale war crimes investigation being conducted as the war is going on, by the nation under attack. In Kharkiv, ordinary local prosecutors have found themselves thrust into complex investigations for which they have little or no experience. In the field, they wear vests, some hand-painted, which say ""War Crimes Prosecutor"", though this job does not technically exist. They are working tirelessly to examine and catalogue scenes of shellings, missile strikes, and murders, and sometimes scenes of brutal crimes against their countrymen. The work is slow and methodical. Klymovets' team analysed the scene in Mala Rohan carefully, and they will return. Back in the city, in an apartment completely wrecked by a shell, another team measured and photographed every piece of damage, down to a small piece of glass embedded in a door. On the outskirts of a different village, yet another team went classroom to classroom in an agricultural college, tracing the path of a shell that had smashed through each dividing wall without exploding. As they go, the prosecutors narrate their observations in fine detail for the benefit of a video camera. They are following freshly-issued guidelines, and they work with the attentive diligence of people who are new to a task. The Ukrainians are being supported by some international expertise - explosives technicians from Slovakia; forensics experts from France; war crimes experts from the UK; a 42-member team from the International Criminal Court. But the sheer number of war crimes investigations now open means the vast majority are being carried out by Ukrainian teams. In Kharkiv, before the invasion, there were only 23 people qualified to investigate war crimes, so the region had no choice but to delegate the power to ordinary prosecutors. ""Everyone is involved to the maximum,"" Klymovets said. ""We are working seven days a week."" But running war crimes investigations during a war presents significant difficulties. There are complex criteria which have to be determined to assess whether a war crime has been committed. The death of a civilian or destruction of a residential building alone is not proof. Were there Ukrainian military present at the site or nearby? Was the intention to strike a civilian target or was it a mistake? Was it definitely a Russian shell that fell on this building? Obtaining accurate information about Ukrainian military movements can be difficult, because members of the public are often reluctant to say anything, even to prosecutors, about the locations of Ukrainian troops. The prosecutors try to check with the military, ""but we cannot guarantee they will tell us the truth,"" said Oleksandr Filchakov, the head of the Kharkiv Regional Prosecutor's Office, ""because there is a war on after all."" Intentionality can be fiendishly difficult to prove, even with the best resources at your disposal. Satellite imagery can assist with determining where a rocket or artillery strike originated, but Ukrainian prosecutors have been unable to access it, because the priority is to use it for military purposes, because there is a war on. So all strikes on residential buildings and those that resulted in the deaths of civilians are all being recorded as alleged war crimes, under Article 438 of the Ukrainian criminal code. ""To be a lawful strike it has to be on a military facility, military unit or some other military object,"" said Serhiy Shevtsov, a local prosecutor in the Kyivskyi district of Kharkiv, as he examined an apartment building in his district that had been hit by a shell. ""If it's a residential block, then it does not matter even if there were military in there until a few days before,"" he said, ""it is Article 438."" This is the prevailing view. But there is concern among some prosecutors and observers that the rush to investigate, while country is still at war, and to brand all these cases initially as war crimes, could undermine a broader future effort to hold Russia accountable. ""It is absolutely fine to be talking about potential war crimes, but the moment you set things in stone you make it easier for the other side to discredit your work,"" said Philippe Sands, a UCL law professor who has served at the UN International Court of Justice and the European Court of Human Rights. ""If you get to a court of law and you can't prove what you said happened, you have only created new problems,"" he said. One regional prosecutor concerned with the process is Denys Masliy, the deputy head of the criminal supervisory department, who said he feared there was a resistance setting in to characterising strikes against apparent civilian targets as anything other than a war crime. ""Any prosecutor, any judge in Ukraine, in this environment, who would examine the details of Russian actions and rule they were lawful, he would look like a betrayer,"" Masliy said, standing under the ruins of a block of flats in central Kharkiv. ""As a prosecutor, I must be honest, but this could be perceived as if I am not acting for Ukraine,"" he said. Masliy, a tall, good-humoured prosecutor with 24 years experience, is something of a lone voice among his colleagues. ""No one wants to talk about this, it is not a popular topic of conversation,"" he said. ""But after this is all over, someone really impartial could take a deep look at all these cases and find problems. They will say we are fraudsters, our work is fake and we are the same as the Russians. The Russians will use it against us."" Part of the problem stems from a genuine grey area around what constitutes a war crime. A week before the invasion, the regional prosecutors in Kharkiv gathered for training on the issue. Masliy posed a scenario to the trainers from the prosecutor general's office: if he took his personal rifle and fired from his window at a Russian tank, and in response the Russians flattened his building, would it be a war crime? ""One of the trainers said, you have a right to shoot because they are invaders,"" said Masliy. ""The other guy said it could be considered a provocation, but he asked, is the danger from my rifle significant enough to justify blasting the whole block of flats? And they ended up having a quarrel with each other."" Three months on from the training session, that hypothetical scenario has become a grim reality. Russia has flattened blocks of flats - with less provocation than a rifle shot - and much worse. The liberated suburbs west of Kyiv revealed execution-style killings and reports of brutal sexual violence. The horrors of Mariupol are yet to be fully discovered. ""It looks clear that war crimes are being committed and it looks like they are widespread and systematic,"" said Sands, the UCL law professor. The chances of justice ever being served for those crimes, at the higher levels of the Russian army and political system, are remote. The key task now, said Sands, was to gather evidence in the most rigorous way possible. And the key challenge facing Ukraine's newly-minted regional war crimes prosecutors, and its politicians, he said, was to show caution and restraint. ""It is very difficult to show restraint in a time of war, and the people investigating are doing tremendous work, but I would urge real cool-headedness in the characterisation of what is being found and how it is being publicised,"" he said. The shelling of Vadym Bobryntsev's house in Mala Rohan, and the death of his wife, was recorded as a war crime, but expert analysis will have to be brought to bear on the case - on small shell fragments from the scene, the likely trajectory of the projectile, on troop movements in the area - before the truth can be established. When that expertise is available is an unknown - there is a severe shortage against the vast number of cases. When the shell hit the house, the village was occupied by the Russians, raising a question over whether the Russian army would have been shelling its own positions, two weeks into its occupation. This was the prosecutor's initial conclusion - Russian on Russian shelling - but it is possible Klymovets could have to contemplate reclassifying the case under a different legal statute if the evidence suggests it was a Ukrainian shell. ""Of course, if we discover that this was done by our military, we will re-classify it,"" he said. To Vadym and Iryna Bobaryntsev's son, Pavlo, the important thing was to have ""an objective investigation, objective truth,"" he said. ""Truth must always prevail. This is a job that, although not very pleasant, helps to find the truth."" In some cases, for some relatives, the objective truth could mean a verdict that the strike that killed their innocent loved one was lawful, under the rules of war. Pavlo stood alone by his father's vegetable patch, after his mother's casket had been loaded into the van, holding the picture of her he had found among the ruins of the house. ""She gave life to me, helped me to solve many problems, treated me with understanding,"" he said. ""How could this not be a crime?"" Follow Joel on Twitter © 2022 BBC.

He has openly compared himself to the Russian tsar, equating Russia's invasion of Ukraine today with Peter's expansionist wars some three centuries ago, and making his strongest acknowledgment yet that his own war is a land grab. Mr Putin's apparent empire-building ambitions bode ill for Ukraine and have irked other neighbours, including Estonia, which called his comments ""completely unacceptable."" Russia's president was meeting young scientists and entrepreneurs when he made the remarks. Before talking IT and tech development he talked politics and power: the new battle he sees for geopolitical dominance. In that, he told his select audience that Peter the Great was a role model. ""You might think he was fighting with Sweden, seizing their lands,"" Mr Putin said, referring to the Northern Wars which Peter launched at the turn of the 18th Century as he forged a new Russian Empire. ""But he seized nothing; he reclaimed it!"" he said, arguing that Slavs had lived in the area for centuries. ""It seems it has fallen to us, too, to reclaim and strengthen,"" Mr Putin concluded, with a near-smirk that left no doubt he was referring to Ukraine and his aims there. Peter's rule, he suggested, was proof that expanding Russia had strengthened it. Mr Putin has taken to citing Russia's past a lot lately, always carefully curated to suit his present-day cause. Several months before he attacked Ukraine, he produced a giant essay in which he essentially argued away the country's historical right to exist. When Russia invaded its neighbour on 24 February, Putin falsely claimed it was a ""special operation"" limited to the eastern Donbas region to ""de-Nazify"" Ukraine and reduce the supposed threat to Russia. But even as he was uttering those words, his troops were moving on Kyiv and bombing land even further west. More than 100 days later, a fifth of Ukrainian territory is under Russian military control, with puppet administrations who talk of referenda on joining Russia. And now Putin feels bold enough to admit that his ""operation"" is in fact an occupation. He also seems to believe the West will ultimately accept the reality his troops are fighting to create on the ground. At the time, ""not one European country"" recognised Russia's claim to the land where Peter created St Petersburg as Russia's bold new capital, Mr Putin said. Now they all do. His comments have also rattled the Baltic countries. The Estonian foreign ministry summoned the Russian ambassador to condemn his reference to Peter the Great's assault on Narva, now in Estonia, as Russia ""reclaiming and strengthening"" its territory. Putin's use of history is selective. Peter the Great, though a ruthless autocrat, was a huge admirer of Western ideas, science and culture, famously building St Petersburg as a ""window on Europe"" and travelling that continent thirsty for knowledge to help drag Russia towards modernity. Putin's increasingly repressive rule slowly closed that window on the West; the war on Ukraine has slammed it shut. The idea of the Russian leader touring Holland or Greenwich in search of ideas and inspiration, as the Tsar once did, now seems impossible. As Putin lectured the young entrepreneurs on an 18th Century tsar, a series of words flashed up behind them: 'future', 'confident', 'victory'. Russia is determined to project defiance in the face of Western condemnation and sanctions and Putin himself certainly appeared relaxed rather than beleaguered. But perhaps there is another lesson from the history books. Peter the Great did eventually conquer land from the Baltics to the Black Sea. But Russia was fighting its Great Northern War for 21 years.

Aiden Aslin and Shaun Pinner were captured while with the Ukrainian army and tried as mercenaries by a Russian proxy court in eastern Ukraine. Their families have called for them to have urgent legal and medical help. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss spoke to her Ukrainian counterpart Dmytro Kuleba on Friday about the two captured men. She said they discussed ""efforts to secure the release of prisoners of war held by Russian proxies"", adding that ""the judgement against them is an egregious breach of the Geneva Convention"". Mr Aslin, 28, from Newark, in Nottinghamshire, and Mr Pinner, 48, from Bedfordshire, who were both already living in Ukraine at the time of the Russian invasion, were captured in April while defending the besieged city of Mariupol. They were sentenced alongside a third man, Moroccan national Saaudun Brahim, by a Russian proxy court in the so-called Donetsk People's Republic, a pro-Russian breakaway region in eastern Ukraine. All three men were charged with being mercenaries, the violent seizure of power and undergoing training to carry out terrorist activities, according to Russia state news agency RIA Novosti. The Britons' families have insisted they are long-serving members of the Ukrainian military and not mercenaries. Mr Brahim's father told Moroccan media outlet Madar21 that his son was not a mercenary but a student in Ukraine when Russia launched its invasion. The men's lawyer said they all wished to appeal against the sentence, Russia's Tass news agency reported. On Friday, a No 10 spokesman said the prime minister ""was appalled at the sentencing of these men"". He said Mr Johnson ""has been following the case closely and has asked ministers to do everything in their power to try and reunite them with their families as soon as we can"". ""We completely condemn the sham sentencing of these men to death. There's no justification at all for this breach of the protection they're entitled to,"" the spokesman added. Defence Secretary Ben Wallace travelled to Kyiv to meet President Volodymyr Zelensky and Ukraine's Defence Minister Oleksii Reznikov. A statement from the Ministry of Defence said Mr Wallace discussed how the UK support will continue to meet Ukraine's needs as the conflict enters a different phase"". Speaking at a virtual Q&A to university students later, Mr Zelensky said that we ""cannot have any kind of excuses for such actions"". Aiden Aslin and Sean Pinner may have been sentenced to death, but what happens now is likely to be determined more by politics than the law. In the short term, it is thought likely the two men will appeal against the conviction. Russian state media says they have a month to do so. But for now Foreign Secretary Liz Truss has not summoned Russia's ambassador in London. Officials fear that if the UK makes this a bilateral dispute with Russia, that would fuel the false claims that the two men are mercenaries, rather than Britons who have made Ukraine their home and served in its armed forces for several years. Nor could Ms Truss formally negotiate with the authorities in Donetsk because UK does not recognise the People's Republic as a separate state. So for now perhaps the best hope might be for Mr Aslin and Mr Pinner to be released as part of a prisoner swap between Ukraine and Russia. But that might be some time coming if Russia wishes to continue using the two men to put political pressure on the UK. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov was quoted by RIA Novosti as saying the trials were ""being held on the basis of the legislation of the Donetsk People's Republic, because the crimes in question were committed on the DPR's territory"". Baroness Helena Kennedy, a senior barrister and expert in human rights law, told the BBC ""Russia committed a war crime by handing them both over to the DPR (Donetsk's People's Republic), which is not a legitimate state"". She called the court in Donetsk a ""pop-up court"", adding that the decision ""is a comeback for the trial of the two men who were tried by the Ukrainian court for war crimes"". Robert Jenrick, MP for Newark, where Mr Aslin's family lives, said the sentencing of the British nationals by a ""kangaroo court"" breached the Geneva Conventions ""in the most egregious manner"". Richard Fuller, MP for North Bedford, said he had spoken to Mr Pinner's mother and stepfather who ""clearly are very, very anxious"". ""This is a humanitarian issue. This is about the rights of individuals under international law,"" he said. Aiden Aslin is a former care worker from Nottinghamshire. He previously fought with Kurdish armed units in Syria against the Islamic State group. Mr Aslin has a Ukrainian fiancee and he moved to Ukraine in 2018. He has both British and Ukrainian citizenship. He passed out as a marine with the Ukrainian military in 2018 and, according to his family, he is part of Ukraine's 36th Marine Brigade. Shaun Pinner used to be a soldier in the British army before he moved to Ukraine in 2018. His wife is Ukrainian and according to his family, Mr Pinner has a three-year contract with the Ukrainian marines that is due to expire at the end of this year. Mr Pinner's family said he had been planning to then take on a humanitarian role in Ukraine. "

Ukraine's health ministry said it has limited access to information from Mariupol, but has conducted testing in Ukraine-held territory and not uncovered any cases. Earlier this week, the UN said that water had mixed with sewage in Mariupol, increasing the risk of a cholera outbreak. The Red Cross has warned that the destruction to sanitation infrastructure had set the ground for the spread of water-borne diseases. Cholera can be a very serious illness. In the most severe cases, if left untreated, the disease can kill within hours. It is caused by a bacterium called Vibrio cholerae and people tend to catch it by eating food or drinking water contaminated with the bug. The spread of cholera is closely linked to poor sanitation facilities and unsafe drinking water where the bug can thrive and spread. It is a disease that often adds to the suffering in humanitarian crises - when there is disruption of water and sanitation supplies and people shelter in crowded spaces, with extra pressure on water systems. Once infected, some people get watery diarrhoea and become severely dehydrated. This needs rapid treatment with fluids and antibiotics. Others get mild to moderate symptoms and many with the disease do not have symptoms at all, but they can still carry the bug in their faeces. Vaccines and improved sanitation can help get cholera outbreaks under control. In addition, sanitary conditions in the city are said to be extremely poor, with piles of rubbish on the streets and bodies still lying under the rubble. ""Many corpses are lying on the ground and inside the buildings... bodies are rotting there. Lots of cockroaches, flies. A pile of dirt. Garbage that no one takes out,"" Kyiv resident Anastasiia Zolotarova, whose mother left Mariupol last week, told the BBC. Mariupol fell into Russian hands in May after a brutal assault lasting nearly three months, which left the city in ruins. In April, the Ukrainian mayor said more than 10,000 civilians had already died. The battle raged for several more weeks after that, suggesting the death toll could be far higher. Makeshift cemeteries have been built around the city to deal with the huge number of bodies, and many more are buried in back yards, parks and squares, according to Mr Boychenko. Earlier this week, the Mariupol city council warned that a cholera outbreak could kill tens of thousands of people, listing a number of factors that could lead to an ""explosive"" epidemic, including a lack of medicine and medical facilities. ""They (the Russians) destroyed our infectious diseases hospital with all the equipment, killed the doctors,"" Mr Boychenko told the BBC. Another Ukrainian Mariupol official recently claimed there was a ""catastrophic"" shortage of medics in the city, adding that the Russian-appointed authorities were trying to persuade retired doctors, even those over the age of 80, to return to work. Bodies lying under piles of rubble and mountains of uncollected rubbish is not the image of Mariupol the Russian-appointed authorities want to portray. They prefer to describe it as a city returning to normal life, posting pictures on social media of children returning to classrooms and lorries collecting rubbish. But much of the city still lies in ruins, and an outbreak of cholera or any other infectious disease would be a further huge challenge for the estimated 100,000 people still living there after the horror of the last few months.

The US has said India shouldn't go ""too far"" with its oil purchases from Russia, but India has defended its continued buying of Russian crude. India is the world's third-largest consumer of oil and over 80% of it is imported. Historically, Russia has not been a major supplier to India. In January and February this year, India did not import any crude from Russia at all. But in March, imports began to rise. According to tanker tracking data in May, Russian oil imports are now the second-largest source for India after imports from Iraq, according to data analytics firm Kpler. Indian contracts for Urals crude - the type most commonly exported by Russia - for March, April, May and June and projections for deliveries in July and August (around 66.5 million barrels in all) - amounts to more than the quantity purchased during all of 2021, according to Kpler. Last year, India's top three suppliers were in the Middle East, followed by the US and Nigeria. Only around 2% of total oil imports (12 million barrels of Urals crude) came from Russia, according to Kpler. India has taken advantage of discounted prices to ramp up oil imports from Russia at a time when global energy prices have been rising. Following its invasion of Ukraine, there were fewer buyers for Russia's Ural crude oil, with some foreign governments and companies deciding to shun Russian energy exports, and its price has fallen. The US has urged India not to buy too much Russian oil, although it's acknowledged that it can't stop these purchases because there are no secondary sanctions on countries doing business with Russia. US State Department official Amos Hochstein has said that he told Indian officials not ""to look like you're taking advantage of the pain that is being felt in European households and in the US"". While the exact price of the sales to India is unknown, ""the discount of Urals to Brent crude [the global benchmark] remains at around $30 per barrel"", says Matt Smith, an analyst at Kpler. These two types of crude normally sell at a similar price. At one point in March, as the price of Urals crude continued to drop, the difference between them reached an all-time record, he adds. The price difference has continued since then. So ""India is likely to purchase at least some of this [Russian] crude at a significant discount,"" says Matt Smith. Although the price is attractive, India's big refining companies are facing a challenge trying to finance these purchases, because of sanctions on Russian banks. It's a problem facing trade in both directions. One of the options India is looking at is a transaction system based on local currencies, where Indian exporters to Russia get paid in roubles instead of dollars or euros. The US has made clear its reservations with this, saying it could ""prop up the rouble or undermine the dollar-based financial system"". India's oil imports from the US went up in February and March, but then fell in April and fell further in May. While India continues to buy a large amount from Middle Eastern countries, the most significant increase in imports is from Russia. Foreign Minister S Jaishankar has said that because of sanctions on other major producers such as Iran and Venezuela, Western countries had ""squeezed every other source of oil we have."" India has also denied recent reports that Russian crude imported by India was being shipped on as refined products to other countries, including the US.

Here are the latest developments: Russian officials have said their forces are fighting for the ""complete liberation"" of the Donbas, which broadly refers to Ukraine's eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, where Russian-backed separatists held significant territory before the invasion. Russia has made slow but significant advances in the east, and now controls over 90% of the Luhansk region. Russian forces are trying to take full control of Severodonetsk. They currently occupy all of the residential areas of the city, according to the Institute for the Study of War (ISW), and fighting is concentrated around the Azot industrial zone. Taking the city is one of Russia's key aims as it would mean they control almost all of the Luhansk region. Russian troops have made ""little progress in attempts to encircle the wider area,"" according to the UK Ministry of Defence (MoD). They have, however, moved north from Popasna, with the key supply route from Bakhmut to Lysychansk being bombarded by Russian artillery. Should the route be taken by Russia, Severodonetsk and Lysychansk would be left with one supply road via Siversk.                         "

The new branding features a circle and two lines, which are said to represent a burger and two French fries. The company has not yet revealed the name of the chain, although a number of options have reportedly been considered. In May, McDonald's said it would pull out of Russia over the Ukraine war. It comes as the Russian chain is scheduled to reopen 15 restaurants this weekend, according to Russian state-owned news agency TASS, which cited Sistema PBO, the firm that manages the business previously owned by McDonald's. ""The green background of the logo symbolises the quality of products and service that our guests are accustomed to,"" a Sistema PBO spokesperson told TASS. Social media users commented that the new logo still looked like an ""M"". Others said that the new logo seemed to be inspired by the flag of Bangladesh, which also has a dark green background and a red circle in similar shades to the new logo. According to newspaper Izvestia, Sistema PBO has submitted eight potential names for the new chain to Rospatent, which is the Russian government agency in charge of intellectual property. The names reportedly under consideration include ""Tot Samyi"", which translates to ""the same one"" and ""Svobodnaya Kassa"" which means ""available cash register"". McDonald's, Sistema PBO and Rospatent did not immediately respond to BBC requests for comment. McDonald's temporarily halted its business in Russia in March, less than two weeks after the country invaded Ukraine. Last month, it announced that it would leave Russia because of the ""humanitarian crisis"" and ""unpredictable operating environment"" caused by the war. It said Alexander Govor, who operated 25 McDonald's restaurants in Siberia, would take over the firm's restaurants. Under the agreement, McDonald's said it would retain its trademark in Russia. It also has an option to buy back its restaurants within 15 years. Before announcing that it was leaving Russia, McDonald's had operated in the country for more than 30 years. The fast food giant opened its first Russian restaurant in Moscow in January 1990. The first store in Pushkin Square saw hundreds of customers queuing outside of it - with many waiting hours for their first taste of the famous American burger. It was seen as a key moment in the opening up of the Soviet Union's economy as the Cold War was coming to an end. "
10,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-61750251,2022-06-10T09:07:53,Refineries cash in as petrol prices soar," Oil refineries are making nearly five times as much money from refining petrol as they did year ago, data show. A lack of capacity to refine petrol and diesel from crude oil has helped to push fuel prices to record levels, and increased profits for refinery owners. Petrol prices are at an all-time high though the oil price remains well below record levels. The loss of Russian supplies has stretched an industry which was already at full capacity. Tuesday saw the fastest rise in petrol prices for 17 years, and the cost of filling a typical family car has now passed £100 for the first time, piling costs on motorists. On Thursday, the price of both petrol and diesel rose by nearly a penny a litre, the RAC said, with petrol at 183.16p a litre and diesel at 188.82p. Part of the increase is down to the high price of crude oil, which is currently above $120 per barrel, driven up by fears the war in Ukraine would cut access to supplies from Russia. That has led to billions of pounds of extra profit for oil producers, and led the UK government to impose a £5bn windfall tax on North Sea oil producers. But oil refiners - the companies which turn crude oil into diesel, petrol and other products - are seeing their profits rise substantially too. “The refiners are printing money at the moment,” says Neil Crosby, senior analyst at the data firm OilX. “More than they have ever witnessed.” There’s a shortage of refining capacity, which has led to substantial increase in the ""refining margin"" – the difference between what they pay for crude oil and what they can make selling the refined products. “This is a real crunch in terms of the industry’s ability to produce these fuels. That very much turns up in the wholesale price of diesel and petrol,” says Mr Crosby. And that's contributed to the fact that although oil prices are still some way off record highs, petrol and diesel have been setting new records day after day. Figures from the data company Refinitiv show how the business of refining oil has become so profitable in the past year. On the 8 June 2021, refiners were making $9.26 per barrel from refining petrol, and $6.84 per barrel refining diesel. On Wednesday, they were making $43.11 on petrol, up 366%, and $51.13 on diesel, up 648%. Figures published by BP, which owns a number of refineries in Europe and the US, shows its own measure of refining profits, the ‘Refining Marker Margin’, up from $7.7 dollars per barrel to $35.7 over the past year. US oil giant ExxonMobil owns a number of refineries, including Fawley in Hampshire, the UK’s largest. Last month the Financial Times quoted its chief executive Darren Woods as saying he did not think that the “very, very high margin environment” was “good for economies around the world.” A source close to a major refinery owner argued that the refiners don’t set the margins themselves. Prices for crude oil, petrol and diesel are determined by the market - what supplies are available, and how much buyers will pay. Before the invasion of Ukraine, much of Europe’s petrol and diesel supply was made in Russian refineries and imported in tankers. In 2020 the UK received 18% of its diesel supply from Russia. Though that supply has not been cut off completely, the volumes coming from Russia are significantly lower as buyers shun Russian exports even before sanctions fully kick in. Fuel stocks were low before the invasion and there was already a global shortage of refining capacity. The sector has not been highly profitable in recent years and attracted little investment. So there was no slack to make up for lost Russian refining capacity. The worldwide lack of refining capability has contributed to high fuel prices in other countries, including the US. In addition, China has cut its exports of refined fuels. And although the UK doesn’t import directly from China, this has a knock-on effect on the entire global market, Mr Crosby says. ExxonMobil did not respond to request for comment. BP declined to comment. "

12,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-61756203,2022-06-10T06:45:22,War's harvest: the looming food crisis," With central heating turned off for a few months, the 'driving season' has focused attention away from gas prices to Britain's transport fuel costs. The trend line on crude oil remains on a strong upward tilt, while the value of sterling against the US dollar pushes prices of petrol and diesel further up to daily record-breaking prices. Where will it peak? We don't know. But as a general rule, high prices help stimulate more supply. Oil exporters are trying to raise output (with limited success) to make up for Russia's exclusion from some of its export markets. And the high-pressure pumps have surged back to work deep under the scrublands of west Texas and New Mexico: America's fracking frontier helps balance energy markets, with short-cycle boom and bust as the price fluctuates. The same cannot be assured for food. Internationally traded grains, cooking oils and fertilizers have seen prices surge in the past year, and particularly since two of the biggest exporters - Russia and Ukraine - went to war. A report just published by the United Nation's Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), sets out alarming prospects that indicate higher prices will not lead to more supply. Those higher prices may continue rising next year and beyond. The report is a six-monthly outlook for the world's food markets. It matters this time more than ever, and many millions of people have cause to look with trepidation at what this report indicates for their ability to feed their families. It says the world's poorest countries are on course to see bills for food imports rising, while getting less volume delivered. In Sub-Saharan Africa that rising price exacerbates the impact of extreme dry weather, where Somalia faces famine. Some nations, or many of their people, spend most of their income on food, so they are particularly vulnerable to the current level of price inflation. Eritrea last year imported all of its wheat from Russia and Ukraine. Sixteen countries depended last year on those two exporters for more than 70% of wheat. The FAO lists 45 countries that depended last year on Russia and Ukraine combined for more than half their sunflower oil. Among the 16 nations with a 90%-plus dependency were populous ones: China, Turkey and Egypt. This year, facing political pressure from rising prices, producers such as India have responded by banning or constraining exports of their farm produce, pushing up the price of traded goods further. Ukraine has been stopped from exporting most of its vast grain and cooking oil output, through destruction and blockades of its ports. Around 90% of its agri-exports went through them, and neither road nor rail have capacity to replace that. Getting a safe corridor for exports is a focus of United Nations efforts, with warnings also from the World Trade Organisation of a protracted food crisis if prices remain high, citing wheat prices up 59% on last year, sunflower oil up 30%, and maize 23% higher. The FAO warns the country's agriculture sector is now hampered by a workforce that is either in exile or in uniform. Crops cannot be harvested. Some fields are too dangerous to farm due to unexploded munitions. Livestock has been abandoned on farms, raising concerns about disease control. Processing plants - to crush sunflower seeds into cooking oil, for instance - need power, which has become either scarce or too expensive. And while grain can be stored, oil seeds have shorter storage time. Meanwhile, at least some of those areas which are still being farmed have shifted to production for supplying Ukraine's war economy, growing potatoes for instance. The Russian Federation's vast production capacity is not constrained by being in a warzone. But it has depended heavily on the European Union for more than half of its imported pesticides and herbicides and more than two-thirds of high-value seeds. Without those inputs, its output could suffer. What the FAO identifies is the combined effect of rising prices along with rising input costs. That includes the cost of energy to run farms, process food and transport it. At least as significant is the cost of fertilizer. The global market for nitrogen-based fertilizer has been dominated by Russia. The FAO highlights Russia's choice to put limits on exports, so prices surged. Energy and fertilizer were the main drivers behind a 58% increase in the cost of internationally traded inputs to farming during last year - a rise on some very low energy prices in the first year of the pandemic. The FAO reports that import bill has risen a further 21% this year, to $348bn. That bill is dominated by developed nations. The big recipients of Russian fertilizer have been Brazil, the European Union and India. But the FAO shows the intensity of dependence provides a different picture. Measured by Russian fertilizer imports per hectare of arable farmland, the four countries that have made most of use of it are an odd assortment: Malaysia, Costa Rica, Slovenia and, above all, Ireland. Sub-Saharan Africa makes less use of those traded inputs. But what it does import has gone up in price by 60% in only two years. These countries are being hit by rising costs of food and of farm inputs. In normal circumstances, a rise in price would be an incentive to farmers around the world to plant more, investing in higher yields, and the next harvest could be expected to bring down prices, as supply rebalances with demand. But the FAO report focuses attention on the real value of agricultural output to farmers around the world as they find their input costs rising. That gives them no incentive to plant more and re-balance the supply shortages that have driven up prices. Simple farm economics tells them to use less fertilizer, so their next crop will have a lower yield. Or they shift from crops that need a lot of fertilizer to those that need less. That explains why many US farms are switching from maize to soybeans. They could, however, stick with maize and take advantage of the other big growth in demand for it, to make ethanol and biodiesel for use in transport. UK petrol now has to include at least 10% bio-fuels. The European Union hopes that increased use of biofuels will help it reduce dependence on Russian fossil fuels. Aviation is eager to find ways to lower its climate change impact by mixing bio-fuels with fossil fuels. With oil-based products reaching record prices, including petrol and diesel, this year's crisis for energy supply and prices meets the crisis for food. If fossil fuels remain expensive, the incentive grows to divert grain into the energy sector. We saw a version of this 14 years ago, pushing grains to record prices and causing a major crisis for poorer countries that import their food. That risk has returned. With Russia at war in Ukraine and in a bitter confrontation with Nato, responding to that crisis looks more difficult. "

Britons Aiden Aslin and Shaun Pinner, and Brahim Saaudun are accused of being mercenaries, Russian state media says. The court, which is not internationally recognised, is in the pro-Russian so-called Donetsk People's Republic. The UK and Ukraine have condemned the sentences for violating international laws protecting prisoners of war. The Britons' families have insisted they are long-serving members of the Ukrainian military and not mercenaries. The men's lawyer said they all wished to appeal against the sentence, Russia's Tass news agency reports. All three men were charged with being mercenaries, the violent seizure of power and undergoing training to carry out terrorist activities, RIA Novosti said. The UK government is ""deeply concerned"" over the death sentences given to Mr Aslin and Mr Pinner and was continuing to work with Ukraine to secure both men's release, Downing Street has said. A spokesman added that prisoners of war ""shouldn't be exploited for political purposes"" and pointed to the laws of war laid out in the Geneva Conventions - which confers ""combatant immunity"" on prisoners of war. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss condemned the sentencing and described it as a ""sham judgement with absolutely no legitimacy"". ""My thoughts are with the families. We continue to do everything we can to support them."" Both the Foreign Office and Downing Street said they would do what they could to support the two Britons' release. Liz Truss is expected to discuss the situation with her Ukrainian counterpart on the telephone tomorrow. But it is difficult to see what diplomatic pressure could meaningfully be brought to bear. Some officials fear that if London were to escalate this into a bilateral dispute with Moscow - rather than leave it to Kyiv - that could fuel the false Russian claims that the two Britons were mercenaries. It is possible the two men could be released as part of a prisoner swap. But previous discussions about that did not make any progress. BBC Ukraine correspondent Joe Inwood, who is monitoring events from the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, said the men, all dressed in black, had stood in a cage in the separatist courtroom listening intently as their sentences were read out. Mr Aslin and Mr Pinner had stood motionless with their heads bowed. In between them, Mr Brahim rocked nervously from side to side. Chair of the panel of judges Alexander Nikulin is quoted by the Russian-state Interfax agency as saying: ""In passing the verdict the court was guided by not only the prescribed norms and rules, but the main, inviolable principle of justice."" Mr Aslin, 28, from Newark, in Nottinghamshire, and Mr Pinner, 48, from Bedfordshire, were captured by Russian forces in April. Their families say they were fighting in the Ukrainian military. The younger man has a Ukrainian fiancee and both men are said to have lived in Ukraine since 2018. Mr Aslin's MP, Robert Jenrick, called for the Russian Ambassador to the UK to be summoned to the Foreign Office to ""account for this egregious breach"" of international law. Ukraine's Foreign Ministry told the BBC that all foreign nationals fighting for Ukraine's military who are captured have rights as prisoners of war under international humanitarian law, and Russia was ""forbidden to abuse, intimidate them or behave inhumanely with them"". A spokesman described the ""so-called trial"" of all three men as ""miserable"", adding the government would ""continue to make every effort to release all defenders of Ukraine"". ""Such public trails place the interests of propaganda above law and morality, and undermine the exchange mechanisms of war prisoners,"" he said. Chairman of the foreign affairs committee Tom Tugendhat accused Russian President Vladimir Putin of carrying out ""a form of hostage taking, a form of revenge"". The Conservative MP told BBC Radio 4's PM programme: ""It's not a state, it's not a court and the judges are merely people dressing up and pretending. ""The reality is this is an absolutely brutal thing to do to three completely innocent people."" The self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic, or DNR, was set up by pro-Russian separatists in 2014. It is not clear whether any executions have taken place in the breakaway republic - or if there will actually be any attempt to execute the men, the BBC's international correspondent Orla Guerin said. She explained there was little doubt DNR officials take their orders directly from Mr Putin and that the sentences appeared to be a tactic by the Kremlin to pressure and embarrass the British government over its military support for Ukraine. Prior to Russia's invasion of Ukraine on 24 February, Mr Putin announced that he was recognising the independence of Donetsk and Luhansk, two breakaway regions of eastern Ukraine, in a move condemned by Nato and Western countries. A month into its invasion, Russia scaled back its ambitions to capture Kyiv, and instead moved its focus to Donbas. In Severodonetsk, a focal point of the war in in recent weeks, Ukrainian troops are engaged in intense street fighting with Russia in the battle for control of the city. "

Mykhaylo Podolyak said Ukraine needed hundreds of Western artillery systems to level the playing field with Russia in the eastern Donbas region. He also said Kyiv is not ready to resume peace talks with Moscow. Ukrainian troops are under relentless bombardment as Russian forces attempt to take control of the whole of Donbas. ""The Russian forces have thrown pretty much everything non-nuclear at the front and that includes heavy artillery, multiple rocket launch systems and aviation,"" Mr Podolyak said. He repeated Ukraine's appeal for more weapons from the West, saying that the ""complete lack of parity"" between the Russian and Ukrainian armies was the reason for Ukraine's heavy casualty rate. ""Our demands for artillery are not just some kind of whim... but an objective need when it comes to the situation on the battlefield,"" he said, adding that Ukraine needs 150 to 300 rocket launch systems to match Russia - a much higher number than it has received so far. Mr Podolyak also said peace talks could only resume if Russia surrendered the territory it had gained since it invaded on 24 February. Mr Podolyak's suggestion that 100 to 200 Ukrainian soldiers are dying each day is higher than previous estimates. On Thursday, Ukraine's Defence Minister, Oleksii Reznikov, said Ukraine was losing 100 soldiers a day, and 500 more were injured. The differing casualty figures are a sign of how difficult it is to get precise information from the battlefield. Despite the heavy losses, Mr Reznikov claimed that a high number of Russian soldiers are also being killed. ""The Kremlin continues to press by sheer mass, stumbles, faces strong rebuffs and suffers huge casualties,"" Mr Reznikov said. ""But yet still has forces to advance in some parts of the front."" Similarly, Luhansk regional governor Sergei Gaidai said Russians were ""dying like flies"" but echoed Mr Podolyak's claim that Ukraine is facing difficulties with a ""catastrophic"" lack of artillery. Russian forces have concentrated their assault on the city of Severodonetsk. On Wednesday Mr Zelensky said ""the fate of the Donbas is being decided there"" and officials said it has been reduced to rubble by intense Russian artillery and missile barrages. In addition to the frontline fighting, two Britons and a Moroccan man who fought for Ukraine's armed forces were sentenced to death on Thursday by an unrecognised court in the so-called Donetsk People's Republic. They were found guilty of being mercenaries and of ""taking action towards the violent seizure of power"". "

He added that nobody knows what might happen in that time, so Russian companies would not be ""concreting over their oil-wells"". It comes as a US official admitted that Russian profits on energy may be higher now than they were before the war. The EU currently imports around 40% of its gas from Russia. The bloc has pledged to reduce its dependency on Russian oil by 90% by the end of 2022, but so far has not made any commitments on gas. The US has placed an embargo on all Russian energy products. The restrictions on Russian energy are designed to punish Moscow for invading Ukraine. But rising global oil and gas prices mean that Russian profits could have risen in recent months, despite a reduction in the overall supply. ""The volume of oil is decreasing on the world market, prices are rising,"" President Putin told a group of young entrepreneurs. ""Company profits are rising,"" he added. That idea was echoed on Thursday by US energy security envoy Amos Hochstein. Asked at a Senate hearing if Russia could be earning more now from fossil fuels than it was before the war, Mr Hochman replied ""I can't deny that"". The Russian president was speaking on Thursday after attending an exhibition in Moscow dedicated to the 350th anniversary of the birth of Russian monarch Peter the Great. The 18th Century ruler fought a long territorial war against Sweden, which Putin appeared to compare to his invasion of Ukraine. ""You get the impression that by fighting Sweden he was grabbing something. He wasn't taking anything, he was taking it back,"" he told his young audience. ""It is our responsibility also to take back and strengthen,"" he said, in an apparent reference to Ukraine. "

People who rely on their cars for work are struggling with high prices as they continue to rise, in the midst of a cost of living crisis. It's partly because of the war in Ukraine, which has led to Europe cutting down oil imports from Russia. Before invading Ukraine, Russia had supplied a quarter of the oil EU countries import - but the UK has joined the US and EU in banning imports of Russian fossil fuels, as part of sanctions against the country due to the war. There has also been criticism of fuel companies like BP and Shell, which have recorded record profits this year - following a decline during the pandemic. All this has led to soaring prices, and that's affected people like Gordon, who works as a driver in Consett, County Durham, and is even considering changing his job because of the cost of petrol in the UK right now.

When she filled up her car this week, it cost her £55, and has seen prices near her as much as 195p per litre. ""In my seven years of driving, it's never cost that much,"" the 24-year-old says. ""I work as a nurse and it takes me half an hour to get there and half an hour back."" But she says there are other nurses in a much worse position than she is. ""My colleagues that do community nursing and have to drive around to patients houses - it's costing them an absolute fortune."" Laura lives in Cumbria, and says the petrol prices are affecting her mental health. She drives her car 25 miles each way to work and back every day. ""I'm finding the cost of petrol just really worrying,"" she says. ""It's affecting my anxiety, I just don't know when the price increase is going to stop and how it's going to affect me getting to work. ""I spend about £200 a month at the moment and I just don't know when that's going to stop going up. I'm just really worried."" And delivery driver Michaela says she's putting £30 of diesel in her car every day - costing her up to £200 a week, up from £90 during the pandemic. One person contacted Radio 1 Newsbeat to say it was costing them the equivalent of a day's wage to buy petrol for a week. Another said they were now spending a quarter of their wages on petrol. In March this year, the government cut fuel duty on petrol and diesel by 5p per litre. But prices have risen so high since then, this reduction's had almost no effect. The Labour Party called for a windfall tax on oil and gas companies, to try and help people during the current cost of living crisis, but despite Conservative MPs initially voting down this plan, chancellor Rishi Sunak recently announced UK energy firms would pay an extra 25% tax over the next 12 months - potentially raising up to £5billion.

Some have travelled on family visas, while others have come via a sponsorship scheme which lets unrelated people host individuals and families. But concerns have been raised that some refugees have been placed in unsuitable accommodation, and that some men are exploiting the sponsorship scheme to contact vulnerable women. As of 7 June, 124,400 visas have been issued, from 154,500 applications: As of 6 June, 70,500 visa holders have arrived in the UK: The government has also said 9,900 Ukrainian children have been offered places at schools in England, out of 11,400 applications. Family members and potential hosts have complained it takes too long for visas to be approved. Home Secretary Priti Patel apologised for the ""frustrating"" delays. The government had faced pressure to lift visa requirements altogether for Ukrainian refugees, but rejected such calls. EU countries allow Ukrainian refugees in for up to three years without a visa. Almost five million Ukrainians have fled to neighbouring countries since the invasion began, although millions have since returned. The Ukraine Sponsorship Scheme - also known as Homes for Ukraine - allows those without relatives in the UK to come here for at least six months. Any Ukrainian national - or immediate family member of a Ukrainian national - who was resident in Ukraine prior to 1 January 2022 qualifies. People with Ukrainian passports can apply online, but those without will have to go to a Visa Application Centre in a neighbouring country. Those who are granted visas can live and work in the UK for up to three years, and access healthcare, welfare and schools. They can also bring their pets with them. Who can apply to host a Ukrainian refugee? Anyone in the UK - of any nationality, providing they have at least six months' leave to remain - can volunteer to host. More than 100,000 people signed up on the first day. You must be able to accommodate the refugees in your own home, or another property. Charities, businesses and community groups can also apply. Hosts are offered a tax-free payment of £350 a month for up to 12 months, regardless of how many individuals they support. Hosts are not expected to cover their guests' living expenses, although they can if they wish. Local authorities will also receive £10,500 in extra funding per refugee for support services, with additional money available for children of school age. Do you have to know the refugee you want to host? At the moment people can only apply to sponsor a specific Ukrainian individual or family. Those who don't personally know anyone fleeing Ukraine can still register their interest. They can also contact refugees through charities, faith groups or local community organisations, including: The government has given Reset an initial grant of £300,000 to run a matching and training service. Many unofficial Facebook groups have also been set up to connect refugees and potential sponsors. What are the safety concerns? The government says everyone who applies to be a host is vetted, and Ukrainian applicants also undergo security checks. Local councils are meant to approve each property and complete basic Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) checks on all potential hosts. However, ""enhanced checks"" are only requested if children are involved. The BBC has evidence that some predatory men are trying to use the sponsorship scheme to prey on young women. In April, the UN's refugee agency, the UNHCR, raised concerns about the UK system, calling for ""adequate safeguards and vetting measures to be in place against exploitation"". In EU countries, matching is mainly organised by national authorities and charities, with fewer private arrangements. Some refugees who have arrived in the UK have to be rehoused after originally being placed in unsuitable accommodation. The family visa scheme was initially limited to those hoping to join immediate family in the UK. However, people can now also apply if the UK resident is an extended family member. It is open to Ukrainian nationals - or immediate family members of a Ukrainian national - who were resident in Ukraine prior to 1 January 2022. Applications from people without passports must be made at a Visa Application Centre (VAC), and applicants must provide biometric information, such as fingerprints. Those with a Ukrainian passport can apply online, with biometric information provided after arrival. People granted family visas can live, work and study in the UK, and access public funds for up to three years. If you're a Ukrainian national granted permission to stay in the UK on or before 18 March 2022, you can also apply to the Ukraine Extension Scheme. Your partner and children can also apply if they're already in the UK as your ""dependants"". "

Nataliiya and her daughters fled their home in the Black Sea port city Odesa because of Russian missile attacks. They were sponsored by Catherine Hummels and her family in Caernarfon, Gwynedd, among the almost 2,000 refugees who have come to Wales. On Wednesday, the Welsh government announced it was pausing applications to its super sponsor scheme. ""We are grateful to all people in Wales for the warm welcome,"" Nataliiya told BBC Radio Wales Breakfast. ""We are very lucky to live in a riverside cabin. [It's] very cosy and beautiful, clean, a corner of paradise."" She is one of two mothers from Odesa, who have three daughters between them, being hosted since last month by mother-of-two Ms Hummels. ""Our family of four became a family of nine,"" said Ms Hummels. ""We're not living as two separate families, we're just one big family."" Nataliiya said a recent highlight of their stay in Wales was watching Eurovision, something they would not normally do at home. ""We were really excited about [Ukraine] winning Eurovision but Nataliiya said 'we'd rather win the war',"" Catherine said. Despite her relief at being safe in Wales with her children, her homeland and absent family are always in her thoughts. ""We miss each other very much but we understand that this is the only way for the safety of our children,"" she reflected. ""Here it's very wonderful - wonderful people, kindness, wonderful nature - but home, it's really home. ""It's in my heart and I want to [go] back."" Catherine said her family is already planning for the day when they can visit Nataliiya and Luda's homes in Odesa. "

The RAC motoring group called it ""a truly dark day"" as the cost of filling a 55-litre tank with petrol reached £100.27 and £103.43 for diesel. The cost of petrol has soared in recent days. The average price of petrol is now 182.31p per litre, and 188.05p per litre for diesel. Fuel prices have increased sharply because the price for crude oil, which is used to make petrol and diesel, has gone up. Crude oil was cheaper at the beginning of the Covid pandemic, because many businesses temporarily closed and demand for energy collapsed. As life returned to normal, the demand for energy increased. But suppliers have struggled to keep up and prices have risen. Another problem is that the oil used to make petrol is paid for in US dollars. The pound is weak against the dollar at the moment, which makes fuel even more expensive. When crude oil prices move, petrol and diesel prices usually follow. But petrol retailers don't always pass on all of the reductions to their customers immediately, or in full. In January, the RAC accused petrol retailers of keeping prices unnecessarily high and taking extra profits. But the Petrol Retailers Association said customers had bought 15% less fuel in 2021 as a result of Covid. It said retailers had to make higher profits on each litre sold to cover costs. Fuel prices were already rising before the war in Ukraine started in February - and the fallout from Russia's invasion has made things worse. Russia is one of the world's largest oil exporters, but sanctions are being introduced. The US has announced a complete ban on Russian oil imports. The UK is to phase out Russian oil by the end of the year, and EU leaders say they will block most Russian oil imports by the end of 2022. This means demand for oil from other producers has increased, leading to higher prices. And although the UK imports just 6% of its crude oil from Russia, it is still affected when global prices rise. In March, the government said it would cut fuel duty on petrol and diesel by 5p per litre for a year. At that time, petrol had hit 167p a litre, and diesel was close to hitting 180p for the first time. However, with current average price levels above 180p for petrol and 186p for diesel, the 5p reduction has long been cancelled out. At the time, the government also criticised retailers for not immediately passing on the fuel duty cut to customers. Petrol prices are unlikely to come down until other oil producers are able to increase supplies to compensate for the loss of Russian oil. The RAC says the government must take ""drastic action"", such as a further fuel duty reduction or a cut in VAT for fuel. ""This is fast becoming a national crisis for the country's 32 million car drivers, as well as countless businesses,"" it adds. "
21,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-61733085,2022-06-09T09:20:21,Cost of living: Chip shops battered by price of fish," It is one of Britain's favourite dishes, but there are fears the future of fish and chips could be at risk due to rising costs. In some Welsh seaside resorts the price of cod and chips has risen to £12. Erin Morgan runs a restaurant in Ceredigion and said she feared the increase in price would see customers stay away. The UK government said it supported the hospitality sector through the pandemic with a multi-million pound package. Ms Morgan, who has been running Caffi Sgadan in Aberporth, Ceredigion, for the last two years, said she was having to shoulder much of the rising cost, as she did not want to put prices up by 50%. ""It's worrying, the price of everything is going up,"" she said, adding cooking oil and other kitchen expenses had also risen along with the fish. ""If we carry on seeing these price rises, we'll have to reassess how we run the business,"" she said. The cost of a large portion of cod and chips at her shop has risen from £7.40 at the start of the year to £7.90 this week. But in some areas of Wales, it can be as much as £12. Gareth Morgan and his family are just trying to hang on at the Pendre Cafe, the business they run in Cardigan. ""Where as you'd have a regular visit two or three times a week possibly, you see them now twice a month possibly."" One option was to sell cheaper unskinned fish. Mr Morgan said: ""We're trying not to pass the cost on to customers, but eventually, prices will have to go up again."" Jo Davies, visiting Aberporth from the Midlands, decided to go for a pie at Caffi Sgadan, because the cod was too pricey. She said: ""I would have had fish, definitely, but it's too expensive. It's more of a treat than a normal dinner time meal now. It's not an option."" National Federation of Fish Friers president, Andrew Crook, said the industry was facing a crisis caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine. From rising energy and fuel costs to cooking oil and fish, prices have spiralled. Mr Crook, who runs his own chip shop in Euxton, Lancashire, has visited Alesund, Norway, to find ways to mitigate the problems. ""I've seen the price of cooking oils more than double,"" he said. ""That's due to the conflict in Ukraine. With fish, we're already seeing post-pandemic inflation. The cost of fuel also affects it. ""And we're expecting tariffs to be applied to Russian whitefish of 35%, which will certainly impact our industry."" Russia is one of the planet's largest seafood producers. Some countries rely on its white fish. Mr Crook wants to increase stocks in other markets, starting with Norway. ""Most vessel owners in Norway produce headed and gutted fish that then goes on for further processing. It's cheaper than producing fillets,"" he said. ""But with prices going up, it might now stack up for them to switch over to fillets that could provide some solutions to our issues. If there's more fish available to is, shortly it will help mitigate the price increases in the future."" With VAT returning to 20% in April, Mr Crooks is calling on the UK government to step in. ""We need a rethink on how we're taxed,"" he said. ""It's a very bleak outlook, it's going to be very tough on a lot of businesses. ""It all means we don't have the money to invest, and provide good jobs. It's going to put a lot of businesses out of business."" The UK government said a £1,000 increase to the Employment Allowance had been announced in the Spring Statement, which would cut takes for businesses. ""Eligible high street businesses can also get 50% off business rates bills, and benefit from a freeze to the business rates multiplier that puts the brakes on bill increases and is worth £4.6 billion over the next five years,"" they said. ""We've always been clear that the lower rate of VAT was a temporary measure and it's right our support reflects the fact the economy has reopened."" "

African countries could be hit especially hard by wheat and fertilizer shortages, WTO director general Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala told the BBC. Millions of tonnes of grain are sitting in warehouses and Ukrainian ports unable to be exported due to the war. She said that was ""really sad"" to see as grain prices soar. Ukraine is a major global exporter of wheat, contributing to 9% of the global market. It also accounts for a massive 42% chunk of the global sunflower oil market, and 16% of the world's maize. Because of gridlock due to a Russian blockade of Black Sea ports, and Russian and Ukrainian mines along the coast, between 20 and 25 million tonnes of wheat are stuck in Ukraine while global grain prices spiral upwards. Ms Okonjo-Iweala said wheat prices had risen 59% compared with last year, sunflower oil was up 30%, while maize was 23% higher. The United Nations is leading efforts to try to establish a ""grain corridor"" with a Turkish naval escort for tankers leaving Odessa and other Ukrainian ports. But Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has said Ukraine needs to clear mines from its Black Sea ports. ""We state daily that we're ready to guarantee the safety of vessels leaving Ukrainian ports and heading for [Turkish waters], we're ready to do that in cooperation with our Turkish colleagues,"" he said on Wednesday. Meanwhile Ukraine has said it needs ""effective security guarantees"" before it can start shipments, voicing concerns that Moscow could use the potential corridor to attack Odessa from the sea. Ukraine typically produces enough to feed 400 million mouths, but Russia stands accused of turning that breadbasket into a stealth missile, with blockaded ports reducing the stream of exports to a trickle. It is some countries in the Middle East and Africa in particular that will feel the threat of shortages. Libya and Eritrea get more than 40% of their wheat from Ukraine, and Lebanon more than 60%. But the pain is global; wheat prices are up a third by since Russia invaded. There is no quick fix. Even with an agreement for a corridor and the ability to secure sufficient ships, mines will have to be removed from the area to ensure safe passage, which is a lengthy painstaking process. And already there are warnings that tens of millions of people are at risk of famine, and social unrest erupting in parts of the globe. It's just a taste of what could be at stake if an agreement fails to materialise, with today's hunger pangs and stretched budgets threatening to spill over into a prolonged devastating economic and social crisis. Only two million tonnes of grain have been exported from Ukraine via train and in trucks, and Ms Okonjo-Iweala said it was ""critically important to see if we can get an answer"" to the problem. UN secretary general Antonio Guterres has formed a task force looking at these issues, she said. ""He's spent a lot of time trying to work with Russia to see if an arrangement can be made, so, we'll keep our fingers crossed,"" she said. If an agreement can't be made, ""this is really going to be a dire situation worldwide"", Ms Okonjo-Iweala said. She said 35 countries in Africa import food from that Black Sea region, while 22 import fertilizer. ""You can imagine what a big impact this is going to have, even just on the African continent,"" she said. ""I hope that we don't go into a really severe food crisis for the next couple of years."" She said grain can't be exported from the region at the moment, and there is a harvest coming up in July, ""with a similar quantity that will go to waste, so you can see that this will work its way through for the next year or two, and that will be really disastrous for certain parts of the world"". She added that supply chain bottlenecks caused by the Covid pandemic and labour shortages exacerbate the issue. In addition, she called on leaders to relax export restrictions on foodstuffs, which can worsen food price spikes. "

""In many respects, the fate of the Donbas is being decided there,"" he said as combat raged in the industrial belt with Russian and separatist forces. He said his troops were inflicting major losses on enemy forces. But Ukrainian forces have been pushed back to the outskirts, according to the region's top Ukrainian official. Serhiy Haidai, governor of the Luhansk region (which makes up the Donbas along with the neighbouring Donetsk region), said special forces had pulled back after Russia ""started levelling the area with shelling and air strikes"". ""Our [forces] now again control only the outskirts of the city,"" he told local media. ""But the fighting is still going on, our [forces] are defending Severodonetsk."" ""It is impossible to say the Russians completely control the city,"" he added. Some 15,000 civilians remained in Severodonetsk and the nearby city of Lysychansk, the governor said. Russia said on Wednesday that Ukraine was suffering ""significant losses in manpower, weapons and military equipment"" in the Donbas. The focus of the war switched to the east at the end of March after Russian forces pulled back from the region around Ukraine's capital, Kyiv. Large parts of the Donbas have been under the control of Russian-backed separatists since earlier fighting in 2014-15. In another development, UN chief Antonio Guterres warned that the consequences for the world of Russia's invasion were worsening, with 1.6 billion people affected. ""The war's impact on food security, energy and finance is systemic, severe and speeding up,"" he said. In an interview for BBC News, World Trade Organization Director General Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala warned that the food crisis could last for years without intervention. African countries could be hit especially hard by wheat and fertilizer shortages, she said. Millions of tonnes of grain are sitting in warehouses and Ukrainian ports, unable to be exported because of the war. Global banking experts believe Russia's economy will shrink 15% by the end of the year - and a further 3% in 2023 - because of Western sanctions, a mass exodus of companies and a collapse in exports. The figures could be even worse if Europe fully weans itself off Russian energy, the Institute of International Finance warned. Russia invaded on 24 February, saying it was seeking to demilitarise and ""de-Nazify"" Ukraine - a claim that has been widely discredited. Since the war began, at least 4,253 civilians have been killed and 5,141 injured according to the UN, along with thousands of combatants on both sides, while more than 14 million people have fled their homes.

Accessing Ukraine's stockpiled grain has become urgent internationally: millions of tonnes are exported annually to Africa and the Middle East. But it cannot be shipped now from Ukraine's Black Sea ports because of Russia's naval blockade. There's more on the UN chief's comments here. Russia is exporting grain from Ukraine via Crimea, Russian-appointed officials in occupied southern Ukraine say. But it is not clear how much is leaving the peninsula, which Russia annexed from Ukraine in 2014. The claim - which the BBC has not been able to verify - comes as Ukrainian officials accuse Russia of stealing about 600,000 tonnes of its grain and exporting some of it. Russia denies it is stealing grain. Russia has held talks with Turkey, which is trying to broker safe maritime corridors in the Black Sea. The BBC's Laurence Peter explains here what is at stake. Irpin was a quiet, leafy neighbourhood near Kyiv before the Russian invasion. But the month-long occupation inflicted a reign of terror there. The BBC's Zhanna Bezpiatchuk spoke to survivors in Irpin, where the bodies of 290 civilian victims have been found. A disproportionate number of victims were women. Dozens are yet to be identified. In one narrow quarter of the suburb the Russians set up at least two fortified checkpoints and two bases, one at a former children's sanatorium. Many homes were burned to the ground, civilians suffered constant shelling, there were shootings and summary executions. Witnesses told our reporter of bodies left lying in the streets for weeks, while others were left in cars that had been riddled with bullets. Read the report in full here. Uber has built a customised version of its tech platform to help the United Nations deliver food and water supplies to war-torn areas of Ukraine. The firm is enabling the UN's World Food Programme (WFP) to co-ordinate a fleet of vehicles smaller than heavy delivery trucks, because the latter face more risk of attack and breakdown on damaged roads. The WFP is hand-picking its own drivers and vehicles, but some are former Uber drivers who worked in Ukraine before the Russian invasion. Read more details here from the BBC's Zoe Kleinman. The world is witnessing a ""gold rush"" for new fossil fuel projects, according to a new report by leading climate change researchers. Soaring energy prices spurred by Russia's invasion of Ukraine have led to new investment in oil and gas. A report by Climate Action Tracker says the world risks being locked into ""irreversible warming"". There is broad consensus that the emission of gases produced by fossil fuels must be dramatically cut by 2030. The BBC's Jonah Fisher explains here how the Ukraine war is undermining global efforts to combat climate change. "

The claim - which the BBC has not been able to verify - comes as Ukrainian officials accuse Russia of stealing about 600,000 tonnes of its grain and exporting some of it. Russia denies it is stealing grain. Accessing Ukraine's stockpiled grain has become urgent internationally: millions of tonnes are exported annually to Africa and the Middle East. But it cannot be shipped now because Russia's navy is blockading Ukraine's Black Sea ports. And Russia says Ukraine must de-mine waters off the Black Sea coast for corridors to export the grain to become operational. The US alleges that Russia is trying to sell stolen Ukrainian wheat to drought-stricken countries in Africa, the New York Times reported. In mid-May, the US sent an alert to 14 countries, mostly in Africa, that Russian cargo ships were leaving ports near Ukraine laden with the grain, the paper reported, citing a State Department cable. Yevgeny Balitsky, in charge of Russian-held areas in Zaporizhzhia region, said grain had left the region on freight trains bound for Crimea - which Russia annexed in 2014 - and, from there, the Middle East. He told Russian state TV ""the main contracts are being concluded with Turkey"" - without giving details. A spokesman for the Russian occupation authority in Crimea, Oleg Kryuchkov, said 11 waggons of grain had arrived in Crimea from Melitopol, a city in Zaporizhzhia. He spoke to Russian state news agency RIA, which also said grain was being transported from the occupied Kherson region. The BBC has approached Russian authorities for comment. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov discussed the grain problem with his Turkish counterpart Mevlut Cavusoglu in Ankara on Wednesday, but there was no breakthrough. Mr Lavrov denied that Russia was obstructing Ukraine's wheat exports, saying the onus was on Ukraine to de-mine the waters off Odesa and other ports. A Ukrainian foreign ministry spokesman said Ukraine could not de-mine the coast because Russia would ""use grain corridors to attack southern Ukraine"". Russia also blames Western sanctions for the food crisis. The West however says Russia has ""weaponised"" food supplies. Turkey is trying to broker a deal to create safe maritime corridors. Last week Ukraine's ambassador to Turkey, Vasyl Bodnar, said Russia was shipping stolen grain from Crimea, and Turkey was among the destinations. ""We have made our appeal for Turkey to help us and, upon the suggestion of the Turkish side, are launching criminal cases regarding those stealing and selling the grains,"" Reuters quoted him as saying. Ukraine Grain Association chief Mykola Gorbachov has warned that, if exports cannot resume from Ukraine's ports, the next harvest, starting in late July, will be severely impacted. He said Ukraine's grain exports would be limited to 20m tonnes maximum next year - via road, river and rail - whereas last year it managed to export 44.7m tonnes. Russia's invasion of Ukraine has fuelled big price rises worldwide for grain, cooking oil, fuel and fertiliser. Part of that is a result of Western sanctions on Russia. Russia and Ukraine jointly account for nearly a third of global wheat supplies - Ukraine's contribution is nearly 10%. In 2019 Ukraine accounted for 16% of the world's corn supplies and 42% of sunflower oil, according to UN data. The current blockade of Ukraine and stockpiling of grain by some countries are contributing to shortages in countries already hit by food insecurity. Petroc Wilton of the World Food Programme in Somalia says the drought in the Horn of Africa is already devastating. ""Four consecutive failed rainy seasons. Fifteen million hungry people, rising to 20 by year's end,"" he said. "
27,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-61731161,2022-06-08T15:48:22,Petrol prices see biggest daily jump in 17 years," The price of petrol saw its biggest daily jump in 17 years on Tuesday with a rise of more than 2p a litre. The RAC motoring group said the average cost of filling a typical family car with petrol was now £99.40 and could exceed £100 as soon as Thursday. Soaring fuel prices have been driven by the war in Ukraine and moves to reduce Europe's dependence on Russian oil. With food and energy bills also surging, many households are under pressure. The average price of petrol rose to 180.73p per litre on Tuesday, the RAC said. Meanwhile, the average price of diesel rose by almost 1.5p to another record high of 186.57p per litre, making the cost of filling a 55-litre family car £102.61. In March, the government announced a 5p per litre cut to fuel duty to help reduce costs for motorists. However, motoring groups have raised concerns retailers are not passing on the cut to customers. On Wednesday the prime minister's official spokesman said the government was ""not confident"" this was happening at all petrol stations. He said the government was ""continuing to look at all possible options"" and ""transparency may have an important role to play"" in ensuring the cut is passed on. It comes after a government source told the BBC a plan to name and shame petrol stations that fail to do so is ""still in the works"". The government says any increases in VAT receipts it gets from rising fuel prices are likely to be largely offset by reduced household spending and VAT on other items. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said if it found sufficient evidence the 5p fuel duty cut had not been passed on to drivers, then it would launch an investigation that could lead to fines for offending retailers. RAC fuel spokesperson Simon Williams said the accelerating costs of forecourt fuel was ""unprecedented"", adding it appeared prices were ""still some way from the peak"". But he said while the average price of diesel is heading towards £2 a litre, the cost of wholesale petrol had unexpectedly dropped by about 5p a litre on Tuesday, which if sustained, could stem the flow of ""daily record petrol prices"". Retailers base their prices on the wholesale cost of petrol and diesel but there is typically a two-week lag for pump prices to reflect any changes in wholesale prices due to the time it takes for fuel to reach forecourts. Mr Williams said the RAC's fuel watch data showed Asda had hiked its average petrol price by nearly 5p a litre in a single day, which he said was ""unheard of"". In response, Asda said wholesale fuel prices had increased ""at an unprecedented rate"" and ""we will do all we can to minimise the impact of rising wholesale prices on our customers"". Meanwhile, some forecourts are already selling petrol above £2 per litre, according to price comparison website PetrolPrices. The highest price was found to be 202.9p at BP sites on the A1 near Sunderland, the M4 near Chippenham in Wiltshire and the M6 near Burton-in-Kendal, Cumbria. The AA motoring group said the 2p litre rise was a ""huge shock"", but said the speculation that petrol prices could rise to £2 per litre on average ""just gives the fuel trade licence to pile on extra cost and the misery"". Fuel prices fell at the beginning of the Covid pandemic as many businesses temporarily closed and demand for energy collapsed. But as global economies recovered, prices rose again and have surged further after Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Changes in prices at the pump are mainly determined by crude oil prices and the dollar exchange rate, because crude oil is traded in dollars. Russia is one of the world's major oil exporters and it is being targeted by economic and trading sanctions, which has led to potential supply concerns, pushing up oil prices. EU leaders have said they will block most Russian oil imports by the end of 2022 to punish Moscow, which has also had an effect on prices. The UK - which gets 8% of its oil needs from Russia - has pledged to phase out Russian oil by the end of the year and though it is not as dependent on Russian oil as the EU is, it is impacted when global prices rise. Energy and food prices are also being driven higher by the war in Ukraine. UK consumer prices are rising at their fastest rate for 40 years, with millions hit by an unprecedented £700-a-year increase to their energy bills in April. Inflation - the rate at which prices rise - hit 9% in April and is expected to continue to rise this year. "

29,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-61188579,2022-06-08T08:26:42,Oil prices have soared. Why won't Opec bring them down?," The world's major oil exporters have agreed to raise their production slightly, to help ease soaring prices. However, members of oil producers' group Opec+ - which includes Russia - are not planning to increase output to the levels requested by oil importing countries. Opec+ is a group of 23 oil-exporting countries which meets every month in Vienna to decide how much crude oil to sell on the world market. At the core of this group are the 13 members of Opec (the Organisation of Oil Exporting Countries), which are mainly Middle Eastern and African countries. Opec was formed in 1960 as a cartel, with the aim of fixing the worldwide supply of oil and its price. Today, Opec nations produce around 30% of the world's crude oil, about 28 million barrels a day. Saudi Arabia is the biggest single oil producer within Opec, producing more than 10 million barrels a day. In 2016, when oil prices were particularly low, Opec joined forces with 10 non-Opec oil producers to create Opec+. Those new members included Russia, which also produces over 10 million barrels a day. Together, these nations produce about 40% of all the world's crude oil. ""Opec+ tailors supply and demand to balance the market,"" says Kate Dourian, of the Energy Institute. ""They keep prices high by lowering supplies when the demand for oil slumps."" Opec+ could also lower prices by putting more oil onto the market, which is what major importers like the US and UK want it to do. In spring 2020, as Covid spread around the world and countries went into lockdown, the price of crude oil crashed because of a lack of buyers. ""Producers were paying people to take the oil off their hands, because they didn't have enough space to store it all,"" says Ms Dourian. After this, Opec+ members agreed to slash production by 10m barrels a day, to help drive the price back up. In June 2021, with demand for crude beginning to recover, Opec+ started gradually increasing supply, putting an extra 400,000 barrels a day onto world markets. In July and August, it will supply an extra 600,000. However, it is still supplying some two and a half million barrels a day less than in spring 2020. When Russia invaded Ukraine, the price of crude soared to well over $100 a barrel, because of panic on the markets. This has caused significant rises in the price of petrol at the pumps. ""When Opec+ cut supplies by 10 million barrels a day in May 2020, they cut too deep,"" says David Fyfe, chief economist at Argus Media. ""Now they're increasing supply at a slow rate that does not take into account the effects of the Russia-Ukraine crisis."" There is a fear among oil buyers that the EU will follow the US and impose an embargo on oil imports from Russia, says Mr Fyfe. Europe currently imports over two and a half million barrels of crude a day from Russia. ""The threat of an embargo on Russian oil has spooked the markets,"" he says, ""because it could lead to an acute supply squeeze."" US President Joe Biden has repeatedly appealed to Saudi Arabia to increase its oil output without success. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson also asked Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates to boost production. He too was rebuffed. ""Saudi and the UAE have spare capacity, but they are refusing to increase output on their own,"" says Kate Dourian. ""They don't want to be dictated to by the West. ""They are saying that the gap between supply and demand is narrowing, and that today's high prices simply reflect panic on the part of oil buyers."" Other Opec+ nations are struggling to increase output. ""Producers like Nigeria and Angola have been undershooting their production quotas by a collective million barrels a day over the past year,"" says David Fyfe. ""Investment fell off during the pandemic - and oil installations, in some cases, haven't been well maintained. Now, they're discovering they can't actually deliver production increases in full."" Opec+ also has to respect Russia's wishes, since it is one of the two biggest partners in the alliance. ""The Russians are happy with prices at this level,"" says Carole Nakhle, CEO of Crystol Energy. ""They have nothing to gain in seeing them go lower. ""Opec wants to keep good relations with Russia, so they are most likely to continue with the agreement they all made last year. That means increasing crude supplies very gradually from now until September."" "

Soaring energy prices spurred by Russia's invasion of Ukraine have led to new investment in oil and gas. A report by Climate Action Tracker (CAT) says the world risks being locked into ""irreversible warming"". There is broad consensus that the emission of gases produced by fossil fuels must be dramatically cut by 2030. That is seen as the only path that would keep global temperature rises to 1.5 degrees and avoid the most damaging effects of climate change. ""There seems to be really a gold rush for new fossil fuel infrastructure,"" Professor Niklas Höhne of NewClimate Institute, a CAT partner, told BBC News. ""Supposedly it helps with short-term energy supply, but new infrastructure once it's built will be there for decades and we will definitely miss the climate targets,"" he said. The report comes as diplomats meet at the UN Bonn Climate Change conference amid new, energy security worries. US envoy on climate change John Kerry warned in a BBC interview ahead of the conference that the war in Ukraine must not be used as an excuse to prolong global reliance on coal. He criticised a number of large countries for not living up to the promises they made at the COP26 climate summit in 2021. Since the start of the war in Ukraine most Western countries have sought to reduce or completely stop buying Russian fossil fuels. Many have announced more ambitious targets for transitioning to renewable energy sources like wind and solar, while also seeking non-Russian sources of gas and oil. Climate Action Tracker (CAT) says new liquefied natural gas (LNG) facilities are now proposed in Germany, Italy, Greece, the Netherlands and Canada. The US, Qatar, Egypt and Algeria have all signed deals to export LNG to different parts of the EU, while gas projects are being revived in west Africa. ""If all these plans materialise they will either end up as massive stranded assets or they'll lock the world into irreversible warming,"" the CAT report says. UN scientists have identified certain events like the melting of large ice sheets, or permafrost, which might act as ""tipping points"" unleashing further accelerated climate change. The EU's plans to move away from using Russian fossil fuels and towards renewables have been criticised for continuing to fund fossil fuel infrastructure. As part of what's called ""REpowerEU"" up to €12bn have been earmarked for gas pipelines and import facilities for liquefied natural gas (LNG) in what the European Commission says is a short-term move to secure energy supplies while renewable capacity is built. In the UK, regulators last week approved the development of a gas field in the North Sea, east of Aberdeen, which has the potential to produce 6.5% of Britain's gas output. Shell's proposals for the Jackdaw field were initially rejected on environmental grounds in October last year and approval came as the UK government seeks to boost domestic energy output. ""We're turbocharging renewables and nuclear, but we are also realistic about our energy needs now,"" UK Business Minister Kwasi Kwarteng posted at the time on Twitter. ""Let's source more of the gas we need from British waters to protect energy security."" "

More than 100 people who fled the Russia-Ukraine war have settled in Bath, but many of them have limited English. Anastasiia Vellikokhatska said in Odessa in Ukraine, her family ""had everything"" but the conflict meant they had come to Bath ""with nothing"". She said learning English is helping her family ""start a new life"" together. Organisations such as Bath Welcome's refugees and the Elac Study Centre are offering the free sessions. Mrs Vellikokhatska said learning English will help her feel safe in her new home. ""We had everything, a normal job, car home, friends, but when we arrived here we had nothing.

US police had for months been tracking the 106m (350ft) Amadea - linked to sanctioned oligarch Suleiman Kerimov. Agents had boarded the boat upon its arrival in Fiji in April, but the boat's owner had launched a legal battle to stop the seizure. They had argued the warrant contravened the Pacific island's local law. However on Tuesday, Fiji's Supreme Court dismissed that argument and ordered the boat's removal, pointing out the giant yacht's docking in the port of Lautoka had cost the local government ""dearly"". US authorities in their submission had argued that the $300m (£238m) boat was estimated to cost about $25-30m to keep running per year. For the public benefit, it was better for the boat to be removed, Chief Justice Kamal Kumar said. He found the vessel had sailed into Fiji waters ""without any permit and most probably to evade prosecution by the United States"". The defence team for the boat's registered owners, Millemarin Investments, had argued the boat was not the property of Mr Kerimov's and instead belonged to another Russian businessman, who is not facing sanctions. But US authorities allege that Mr Kerimov still has a beneficial connection to the boat. The FBI alleged the boat had also tried to escape detection ""almost immediately"" after the war began by turning off its automated tracking system. US authorities first sanctioned Mr Kerimov in 2018 over a slew of money-laundering charges. The Russian has been sanctioned by other nations since, including by the EU block after Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Fiji's Director of Public Prosecutions said the court ruling on Tuesday demonstrated his nation's commitment to external assistance requests and international law. The court accepted the validity of the US warrant and agreed that issues concerning money laundering and ownership need to be decided in the court of original jurisdiction,"" said Christopher Pryde. Western authorities have stepped up a crackdown on the assets of dozens of Russian oligarchs in the wake of the Ukraine invasion in February. "

Less developed countries in Europe and east Asia face a ""major recession"", it said. The risk of high inflation and low growth - so-called ""stagflation"" - is also higher, World Bank President David Malpass said. Energy and food bills have been rising around the world. ""The war in Ukraine, lockdowns in China, supply-chain disruptions, and the risk of stagflation are hammering growth. For many countries, recession will be hard to avoid,"" Mr Malpass said. He also warned in the World Bank's Global Economic Prospects report for June that the danger of stagflation was ""considerable"". ""Subdued growth will likely persist throughout the decade because of weak investment in most of the world. With inflation now running at multi-decade highs in many countries and supply expected to grow slowly, there is a risk that inflation will remain higher for longer."" Also on Tuesday, the World Bank approved $1.49bn (£1.2bn) of additional funding for Ukraine, which it said ""will be used to pay for wages for government and social workers."" The new financing is part of a more than $4bn support package for the country, which covers areas including healthcare, education and sanitation. More than a hundred days have passed since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, but only now is the sobering size of the shock waves hitting nations and households thousands of miles away from that epicentre becoming clear. Developing nations were already struggling to get back on their feet. For every $20 households there typically earned pre-pandemic, they now only get $19. But soaring food and energy costs threaten to throw livelihoods further into reverse, spelling misery and hardship for the most vulnerable. And that's not just true for poorer countries. One survey shows one in six British households have turned to a food bank. That global struggle could be compounded by the higher interest rates being used to ease inflation, just as government support to ease the impact of the pandemic is evaporating. The World Bank is urging immediate action, from debt relief, to urging nations not to put restrictions on food exports. Instead they want policymakers to show they are acting together to safeguard food and energy supplies, reassure volatile markets, and ease price spikes,. Policymakers have already had to tackle an extraordinary battle. But if we down tools now the World Bank suggests we could face an even more prolonged and painful crisis. Hardship today doesn't just mean misery and social unrest, it can blight lives for years. The countries in Europe that are most likely to suffer a sharp drop in economic output in 2022 are Ukraine and Russia, the World Bank forecast. But it warned that the fallout from the war and the Covid pandemic would be wider. ""Even if a global recession is averted, the pain of stagflation could persist for several years - unless major supply increases are set in motion,"" Mr Malpass said. Between 2021 and 2024, global growth is projected to slow by 2.7 percentage points, Mr Malpass said, more than twice the slow down seen between 1976 and 1979, when the world last saw stagflation. The report warned that interest rate increases needed to control inflation at the end of the 1970s were so steep that they touched off a global recession in 1982, and a string of financial crises in emerging market and developing economies. However, in the 1970s the dollar was weaker and oil was relatively more expensive. Speaking to the BBC, Ayhan Kose, director of the World Bank's Prospects Group said ""There is not much governments can easily do"" to tackle rising energy prices. ""They shouldn't introduce export bans, they shouldn't introduce subsidies, they shouldn't introduce price controls,"" Mr Kose said. ""Those type of interventions distort prices and they translate into even higher prices,"" he added. "
35,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-61723282,2022-06-08T00:08:08,Mariupol: Azovstal defenders' bodies arrive in Kyiv - families," The bodies of some Ukrainian fighters killed defending the key south-eastern port of Mariupol have arrived in Kyiv, according to the soldiers' families. They say this was part of a swap with Russia, with each side receiving 160 bodies. Moscow has not commented. The fighters spent weeks holed up in the city's Azovstal steelworks. In May, the survivors were taken prisoner. More than 1,000 Ukrainian soldiers captured in Mariupol have reportedly been transferred to Russia. The soldiers, who were being held in locations controlled by Russian-backed forces in eastern Ukraine, were moved to Russia for investigation, a Russian law enforcement source told Itar-Tass, a state-owned Russian news agency. The same source said more prisoner transfers would follow. There has been no confirmation from the Ukrainian side, but previously Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky said he thought more than 2,500 Azovstal defenders - who also include border guards, police and territorial defence - were being held by Russia. Kyiv says Mariupol's last defenders were given orders to save their lives after successfully completing their main goal of holding up Russian troops and not allowing them to be redeployed to other key battlefields. Moscow says the Ukrainian defenders were forced to surrender. Mariupol was captured by Russia in May after a months-long siege and heavy shelling that virtually wiped out the city. Ukrainian officials estimate that tens of thousands of people, including children, may have been killed. They have also been warning of a possible outbreak of cholera in the city, where many bodies are still believed to be buried under the rubble, and sewage has reportedly contaminated main water supply chains. After Mariupol, Russian forces turned their attention to Severodonetsk - and the twin city of Lysychansk. Seizing them would give the Russians control of the Luhansk region - which, alongside Donetsk, makes up the wider Donbas, stated target of Russian operations. In a post on Telegram late on Monday, the Ukrainian fighters' families said ""the bodies of the killed Azovstal defenders"" had arrived in the capital Kyiv. They said that one-third of those were fighters from the Azov regiment, and that the identification process was continuing and could take up to three months. Russia has not officially confirmed the exchange of bodies. However, Russian war correspondent Irina Kuksenkova on Friday reported that the exchange did take place on the line of contact between Ukrainian and Russian forces in the southern Zaporizhzhia region. She said each side received 160 bodies. President Zelensky has said Ukraine's intelligence officials were working on a plan to secure the release of the surviving fighters, without giving any further details. Kyiv wants them all handed over, but several leading Russian lawmakers are demanding that some of the soldiers - specifically from the Azov regiment - should be put on trial. The regiment was set up in 2014, with some of its members initially linked to far-right groups. Kyiv says the unit has since been reformed and is now outside politics. President Vladimir Putin has repeatedly stated that his ""special military operation"" launched on 24 February was to de-Nazify and de-militarise Ukraine. He provided no evidence to back his claims, but officials have often mentioned the Azov Regiment. In Ukraine, however, many people regard Azov soldiers as national heroes fighting what they say is in fact the neo-Nazi regime of President Putin. "
36,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-61667500,2022-06-07T23:33:25,Irpin: Russia's reign of terror in a quiet neighbourhood near Kyiv," In a corner of the leafy town of Irpin, the brutality of the Russian occupation was clear from the start. The body of a young woman in a red coat would remain in the street for four weeks - lying where she had been trampled not once, but over and over again, under the wheels of Russian armoured vehicles. Irpin is on the doorstep of Kyiv, and in early March Russian troops intent on conquering the capital took hold of the town. Its blown-up bridge and river crossing became known internationally as a risky escape route from next-door Bucha, the scene of many of Russia's alleged war crimes. In Irpin itself, the bodies of 290 civilian victims have been found and witnesses and prosecutors tell of a month of terror in a narrow zone in the town's south-western quarter. A disproportionate number of victims were women. Warning: You may find some of the details of this story distressing Before the war, a handful of streets a short bus-ride away from the capital were a haven for families from the bustle of a busy capital. Now Pushkinska St, Lermontova St, Davidchuka and Vygovskogo all bear the scars of a brutal occupation. Walking along Pushkinska St shortly after it was liberated, I saw signs of damage to almost every home. Many had been burned to the ground. But far more terrifying than the destruction were the accounts of violence against civilians, of shootings and summary executions and of people being held by force in a basement. During the occupation, Pushkinska St became a vital artery - a route to safety for civilians. If you made it out to Universytetska St, then it was a short drive to the ring road and a Ukrainian-held position. All the way down Universytetska St, civilian cars were riddled with bullets and shrapnel. Close to Central Park, near the junction with Pushkinska, one of the local deputies Artem Hurin says he saw bodies in three cars and an elderly man lying dead on the street. Eleven units of the Russian army and police are alleged by Ukraine's intelligence and prosecutors to have taken part in the occupation and destruction in Irpin, Bucha and nearby Hostomel. Among them was the 141st motorised regiment - otherwise known as the notorious Kadyrovtsi from Chechnya. So was the 234th airborne assault regiment, whose servicemen were once rewarded for taking part in the occupation of Crimea. Armoured vehicles were stationed behind almost every house in Pushkinska St, according to Hurin, who served as a military volunteer when Irpin was under attack. Inside this narrow quarter the Russians set up at least two fortified checkpoints with firing positions on Lermontova St, where it meets Kyivska and Pushkinska. There were at least two bases, at a former children's sanatorium at Lastivka, on the south-western corner of the quarter, and at a big residential complex close by. The complex was close to the junction of Pushkinska and Vygovskogo St where the woman in the red coat was run over by Russian armoured vehicles. Town mayor Oleksandr Markushyn and several other residents told the BBC that her body lay there for almost a month. Her face was unrecognisable from being run over numerous times, said Artem Hurin: ""But I saw from her hands she was very young."" On the other side of the street lay the body of an older man: ""From his age he could have been her dad."" Ukrainian military volunteers found a plastic card and a handwritten shopping list in the woman's purse and determined that she was probably around 25. ""We didn't find any ID on her,"" said Petro Korol, in charge of gathering bodies for burial. More than half the victims in this part of Irpin were shot. So many of the dead in this residential quarter were women that the mayor renamed it the place of ""women's killings"". On 8 March local residents risked constant shelling and gunfire to bury four people shot by the Russians in a shallow grave beside a bus stop where Davidchuka meets Lysenka St. ""We buried a civilian woman in a pink coat in her 40s with a man. They were killed in the car,"" resident Tetyana told me. ""And two territorial defence volunteers were shot dead in their car."" The volunteers were later identified as local residents Dmytro Ukrainets and Sergiy Malyuk. Dozens of the 290 victims are yet to be identified, but prosecutors told me so far they had details of 161 men, 73 women and one child. Many were shot dead in Pushkinska and neighbouring streets. Others died by artillery fire or starved to death. Most of the suspected war crimes here, as identified by prosecutors and witnesses, happened in mid-March and then in the final days before the Russian withdrawal. As the Ukrainian army regained control of the outskirts of Kyiv, the Russians became more nervous and began shooting on sight. For residents, misunderstanding an order or refusing to wear a white armband as the Russians insisted could end in death. ""I heard shots in the middle of March beneath the windows of my flat,"" recalled Ludmila Menkivska, 54, who lives in a residential building on Pushkinska St. The next morning she saw a woman's body on the street through her window. There was nothing she could do. Had she tried to bury her, she could have been killed herself. ""Every morning for over two weeks I came to my window to check if she was still there. Then every time I looked from my window after shelling I saw her again. I knew nothing about her but my heart was broken. She looked between 40 and 45."" Rather than leave her home, Ludmila decided to stay where she was. No stranger to war, she had fled her home in eastern Ukraine when war broke out in 2014 between the Ukrainian army and Russian-backed separatists. After the liberation, the woman's body was taken away. She was called Alyona and had a hearing disability, said local resident Mykhailo Kuzmenko, who fears she was killed because she failed to hear the orders of Russian soldiers. The last week of occupation proved to be the deadliest. Larisa Osypova,75, had run the local kindergarten for years, raising generations of children. Around 24 March she was shot dead in her backyard with her husband Vadym at 8A Davydchuka St. They had been sheltering in their house from shelling when shots rang out. ""I saw my neighbour running out to help me,"" said Kostyantyn Bielkin. ""Then I heard a round of gunshots and Vadym crying out 'Larisa! Larisa, then there was an explosion and more shots across the fence."" He was hit three times and remembers nothing more. His neighbours were left unburied for days. Osypova was shot in the face. For 43 years she had run the Vinochok kindergarten, retiring not long before. ""People keep calling me and saying: 'We grew up in her hands.' Nobody can believe what happened,"" says her niece Natalya Dovga. ""Kids used to run up to her immediately,"" said Vinochok's new head teacher Oksana Ptashnyk. ""They never understood she was elderly. For thousands of children she was like a mother, warm, caring and easy-going."" Around the same time, Oleksandr Sheremet and two other men were shot dead in the yard of his apartment block at 9A Vygovskogo St, just around the corner from Larisa Osipova's house. Inside the building a fourth man was killed in his flat. Sheremet, 37, was a children's orienteering coach and had just returned home on the eve of the invasion with a group of children he had taken to the Carpathian Mountains. He had sent his wife Yulia and two of their three children to stay with friends in France. ""He could have fled to the west of Ukraine or abroad but he chose to stay to look after his father, the elderly and to help evacuate children,"" she said. His father Leonid saw him alive for the last time on 22 March. He next saw his body in Kyiv morgue with five bullet wounds, to his chest, stomach, hand and leg. Irpin's other summary executions took place around the same time at 42 Davidchuka St. Two men, one of them an elderly disabled man, were shot. Another man was killed at a sports club in the same block - award-winning boxer and children's trainer Oleksiy Dzhunkivsky, Almost next door to the murders in Davidchuka St, Tetiana Levchenko spent the final days of occupation holed up in a basement with other residents, at the mercy of Russian soldiers. ""I was worried they would force all of us to sit on their tanks and act as a human shield."" Her son and daughter had fled with their children but Tetiana, a 54-year-old engineer, had decided to stay hiding in the basement. ""On 23 March the Russian military forced open the door. The next day they forced almost 30 people altogether to stay with us. As they were bringing people in, they killed a male civilian,"" she recalls. While she had been in the basement, her elderly parents remained at home. ""The Russians blew up two grenades next to them and fired a round of shots into the wardrobe. That was how they made the elderly reveal where the younger people were hiding."" Freedom came finally on 26 March, but Tetiana and the others waited for hours to venture outside, scared that the Russians were still there. Before the war she had worked as an activist to keep Irpin green and keep the local river clean. ""Then the foreigners came in and destroyed our town and our lives."" Visit Vygovskogo and Pushkinska St now and you will find residents in almost every backyard, trying to clean up and rebuild. They have learned to take pleasure in the simple things - like having their electricity, gas and water restored. Those whose homes are still standing can even cook in their own kitchens. But beneath this facade of normality, the atrocities committed in four weeks in March are never far away.

She said she had ""nothing to apologise for"" over her response to Russia's annexation of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014, when she supported sanctions. She also defended her opposition in office to Ukraine joining Nato. Mrs Merkel has been accused of leaving Germany vulnerable by pursuing business-led relations with Russia. The Nord Stream 2 pipeline to carry Russian natural gas directly to Germany was built while she was chancellor and only suspended by her successor, Chancellor Olaf Scholz, shortly before Russia invaded Ukraine on 24 February. Under pressure to impose stringent new sanctions over the invasion, Germany is struggling to reduce its dependence on Russian energy without damaging its own economy. But Mrs Merkel said Europe and Russia were neighbours that could not ignore each other. ""We have to find a way to co-exist despite all our differences,"" she said. The invasion was ""not just unacceptable but also a major mistake by Russia"", she told German journalist and author Alexander Osang in an interview televised by broadcaster ARD. ""If we start going back through the centuries and arguing over which bit of territory should belong to whom, then we will only have war,"" she said. ""That's not an option whatsoever."" She defended the sanctions imposed on Russia in response to the annexation of Crimea and Germany's role in maintaining the Minsk peace process, which was meant to end the fighting in eastern Ukraine in 2014-15. The peace process, she argued, allowed Ukraine time to develop as a nation and strengthen its military. ""I don't have to blame myself for not trying hard enough,"" she said. ""I don't see that I have to say 'that was wrong' and that's why I have nothing to apologise for."" She had opposed Nato membership for Ukraine in 2008, she said, because she had wanted to prevent escalation with Russia and because Ukraine itself was not ready. ""That wasn't the Ukraine we know today,"" she said. ""The country was not stable, it was riddled with corruption."" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, whose country remains outside the Nato alliance despite extensive Western defence aid since the invasion, has described Germany's decision in 2008 as a ""miscalculation"". On Tuesday Mrs Merkel, who left office six months ago, said she had ""the highest respect"" for Mr Zelensky and was impressed by ""the courage and passion"" with which Ukrainians were fighting for their country.

Justin Crump said Russia appears to have a slight advantage, but is ""lucky to capture a field in 24 hours"". You can find more of Mr Crump's comments here. Meanwhile, the bodies of 160 Ukrainian fighters killed during the battle for Mariupol have arrived in the capital Kyiv. The bodies were part of a swap with Russia, according to the soldiers' families. Moscow has not commented. Ukrainian forces were holed up for weeks in the Azovstal steelworks, which was the last part of Mariupol to fall to Russian and pro-Russian forces. But in May they were told to surrender, having completed their main goal of preventing Russian troops from redeploying to other parts of the front line. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky says there are around 2,500 defenders of Azovstal now being held by Russia. Their fate remains unclear. Read more about the bodies of the Azovstal fighters here. Two Britons captured by Russian forces in Ukraine have appeared in court in the so-called Donetsk People's Republic - part of the Donbas region held by pro-Russian rebels since 2014. Video footage from the court, which is not internationally recognised, showed Aiden Aslin and Shaun Pinner alongside Moroccan national Saaudun Brahim. They are reportedly charged with being mercenaries. But their families say they were in Ukraine's military. It is feared the court could pass the death penalty if it convicts them. Read more about the court appearance here. A row has broken out between Ukraine's state nuclear company and the head of the UN's nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). IAEA head Rafael Grossi said on Monday he was working to send a delegation to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, which is under Russian control. He said the Ukrainian government wanted the delegation to visit. But on Tuesday, Ukraine's nuclear company Energoatom said there had been no invitation from Ukraine and that Mr Grossi was lying. In a furious statement, Energoatom said any visit would be a ""means to legitimise the stay of the occupiers"". Mr Grossi called the suggestion of lying ""absurd"". Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine is the largest in Europe. It was seized by Russian forces in early March. Read more about the row here. Three Brits - a dog trainer, a farmer and a technology executive - have formed an unlikely alliance, working with a local organisation in eastern Ukraine to evacuate the elderly and frail from towns and cities on the front line. ""I know my parents worry,"" says the dog trainer, who like the others prefers not to be named. ""But they are just really proud of what I am doing"". Using a van as a makeshift ambulance, the team has managed to relocate around 150 of the most vulnerable people. Some get taken to a hospital still under Ukrainian control, others to a railway station from where they can travel to relative safety. Our correspondent Orla Guerin was with the three volunteers as they collected 96-year-old Anastacia, who spent days underground when her village was shelled. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky says he is ""very happy"" that Boris Johnson is still Britain's prime minister, after he survived an attempt to remove him from office. Mr Johnson won a vote of no confidence on Monday, but 148 of his own Tory MPs voted to remove him. ""I'm glad we haven't lost an important ally, this is great news,"" Mr Zelensky said on Tuesday. The UK is seen as one of the strongest supporters of Ukraine in its war against Russia, and recently announced it would supply Kyiv with longer-range rockets.

Rafael Grossi said on Monday that Ukraine had invited the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to visit the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant. But Energoatom said there was no invitation, and that any visit would legitimise Russia's presence there. Mr Grossi called the allegation of lying ""absurd"". ""It's a war and there are emotions and people have very strong positions,"" he said in an interview with the BBC. But he claimed his organisation had a contractual obligation to perform safety inspections, arguing that this is not a ""courtesy invitation that can or cannot be extended"". He tweeted on Monday that he was working to send an expert mission to the plant, writing ""Ukraine requested us, we will go there"". The IAEA is a UN-based organisation which works with states to promote the safe use of nuclear technology. Ukraine's state nuclear company Energoatom released a furious statement on Tuesday, accusing Mr Grossi of lying by claiming that Ukraine had requested the visit. It said any visit would be a ""means to legitimise the stay of the occupiers"". According to Russian media, the IAEA is in touch with Russian authorities over a possible visit. Russia seized the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant - the largest in Europe - in early March, just days after it invaded Ukraine. There was an international outcry after buildings at the power station were shelled by Russian forces as they seized it. No critical infrastructure was damaged and radiation levels remained normal. The plant continues to operate, with Ukrainian staff working under Russian orders. Mr Grossi has for months said that the situation at Zaporizhzhia poses a safety risk and that he wants to lead a mission there. Safety data from Zaporizhzhia is no longer being transmitted to the IAEA, and Ukrainian staff are working under ""extremely stressful and challenging working conditions"", the IAEA head said in a statement on Monday. Energoatom claimed in its statement that the transmission of safety data from the plant was cut off with the IAEA's consent. Mr Grossi dismissed that allegation as ""careless statements"" made under ""high emotion"". On Tuesday, the IAEA said radiation detectors at the decommissioned Chernobyl nuclear power plant, which was also under Russian control for several weeks, were back online for the first time after Ukraine took back control of the plant. Radiation levels there were reported to be in line with those measured before the conflict. "

Aiden Aslin, 28, from Nottinghamshire, and Shaun Pinner, 48, from Bedfordshire, are being held in the so-called Donetsk People's Republic. They are reportedly charged with being mercenaries. But their families say they were in Ukraine's military. It is feared the court, which is not internationally recognised, could pass the death penalty if it convicts them. A video has emerged of the two Britons attending a court hearing alongside a third man, Moroccan national Saaudun Brahim. In the footage, Mr Aslin and Mr Pinner spoke only to confirm they knew the charges against them and were happy for their case to proceed without the evidence of witnesses. Both were able to stand unaided and seemed aware of their surroundings. They have also been accused of violent seizure of power and undergoing training to carry out terrorist activities. The self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic, or DNR, was set up by pro-Russian separatists in 2014. According to Russia's Interfax news agency, leader of the DNR Denis Pushilin has said the men will be charged in the region's supreme court. Footage of Mr Aslin released shortly after his capture in the Ukrainian port city of Mariupol led many to fear for his wellbeing. The families of both Mr Aslin, from Newark, and Mr Pinner released statements saying that they were long-serving members of the Ukrainian military and not volunteers or mercenaries. Both men are said to have lived in Ukraine since 2018. In a statement on Tuesday, Mr Aslin's family said it ""was a very sensitive and emotional time for our family, and we would like to say thank you to all that have supported us"". They added: ""We are currently working with the Ukrainian government and the Foreign Office to try and bring Aiden home. Aiden is a much-loved man and very much missed, and we hope that he will be released very soon."" Asked about the case earlier, Justice Secretary Dominic Raab told LBC radio: ""I don't know all the details, but of course we would expect the laws of armed conflict to be respected, and we will make sure that we will make all the representations. ""I know the Foreign Office will be looking at making sure all those representations are made."" "
41,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-61720402,2022-06-07T16:31:04,Ukraine War: Why I risk my life to provide aid in Ukraine," At first glance they are an unlikely line up for aid workers in a war zone - a dog trainer from Kent, a farmer from Cornwall, and a technology executive from Sussex. But these three British volunteers were drawn - separately - to Ukraine. They teamed up here and have spent months in harm's way evacuating the elderly and the frail from areas near front lines. They fund themselves and prefer not to be named. ""I know my parents worry,"" says the dog trainer who, at 21, is the youngest. ""I have had phone calls with my mum where she has been in tears, but they are just really proud of what I am doing. They know I will be out here for a while, and they don't know when I will be coming home."" As we speak, air raid sirens wail and explosions thud in the distance now and then. She hopes one day to be a qualified paramedic. For now, she has done a course in trauma first aid, and is learning on the job. When we joined the volunteers for a day, she was quick to check the lower leg of an evacuee with a blackened, gangrenous wound. Medical care had already been arranged for him at a safe distance. The team regularly travel to and from towns and cities in the path of Russian forces who are grinding forward across the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine. Shelling is a constant threat. One run was so risky they were ordered by the Ukrainian military to put their body armour on. ""There have been a few moments when you feel it's a bit close for comfort,"" she says. ""We stick together. As much danger as we are in, we feel quite prepared and reliable as a team."" They concede that some may wonder what they are doing in this war-torn region, and how much help they can provide. ""I didn't expect that we would be needed or wanted,"" says the farmer, ""but we are."" Back in the UK he was tending to cattle and sheep before losing his job. After Russia invaded Ukraine, he filled a van with aid and drove it over from the UK. It now serves as their rough and ready ambulance. ""In an ideal world we would be redundant,"" he says, ""but we are not. We are here doing what we can. We are not experts, but we've done a lot in the last few months. I don't feel like there's anything else I could be doing that's more important than this."" He was behind the wheel on the day of our visit, but the volunteers stress they share the load, and the highs and lows, buoying each other up with ""British humour"". They have moved about 150 people in recent months - some to hospital in the city of Kramatorsk, others to a train station in the Pokrovsk. They collaborate with an established Ukrainian NGO, Vostok SOS, which gives them lists of evacuees to be collected each day, along with information about their medical condition. As they grapple with day-to-day logistics and shifting front lines, the team has another concern - that international attention is fading. ""Aid is coming in slower,"" says the former farmer. ""That leads me to believe that people are becoming kind of used to the war, and I think that's something that really should not be happening."" And he warns that there are still many in dire need of evacuation. ""Many people think those who needed to get out have gotten out,"" he says. ""That isn't the case."" The third member of the team was already in motion when the war broke out. She had spent six months travelling in the Middle East, after leaving her role working in technology in a start-up. ""My life infrastructure had already been put on pause,"" she tells me. ""So I've been free to come out here and stay out here indefinitely. We just want to get things done without any bureaucracy, any red tape. We work every day because this is what we care about. This is what matters because we are all Europeans. An attack on Ukraine by Russia is attack on all of us."" Her own family knows the trauma of war and dislocation. Her grandmother had to flee from Poland during World War Two. And when the team collect a 96-year old called Anastacia, she tenderly holds her hand. Anastasia is painfully frail and has to be lifted with care. Her 70-year-old son Yevgeny tells us they spent days below ground when their village was shelled. ""Four or five days ago they started firing with mortars,"" he says. ""Our garden was hit, just 10 metres from our house. When it was so loud that everything shook, my mother was very scared."" Anastasia is carefully carried on to a train, with Yevgeny by her side. Once again she has to flee, just as she did at 15, during World War Two. The volunteer - who is now a world away from her old life in high tech - says the hardest days are when they cannot evacuate everyone. Some don't want to go - reluctant to leave home and hearth even when the war is closing in. ""You hope that you're doing the right thing taking them away from their land, and that they will get to come home. But you don't know. And you think about that for every single person you evacuate. Will they get to come back?"" Her voice catches with emotion. ""The land here is beautiful,"" she tells me. ""And I was told that if you take a Ukrainian away from that, they will die. Whenever I evacuate a woman, I will pick her a flower from outside her building to take away. That's the only thing I can do."" "

Mr Johnson won a confidence vote despite a major revolt that saw 148 of his own Tory MPs vote to remove him. ""I'm glad we haven't lost an important ally, this is great news,"" Mr Zelensky said at an online event. Mr Johnson has forged a close relationship with President Zelensky since Russia's invasion of Ukraine. He called Mr Johnson a ""true friend of Ukraine"" and a ""concrete"" supporter in an interview at a virtual conference hosted by the Financial Times on Tuesday. The UK was among the first to provide weapons to support Ukraine's defence and - like its Western allies - has imposed sweeping sanctions on Russian targets prosecuting the war. In April, Mr Johnson pledged ""unwavering support"" on a visit to the capital Kyiv, where he did an unannounced walkabout of the city with President Zelensky. Mr Johnson has faced a backlash from MPs and the public after he was fined by police for breaking his own lockdown laws at a 2020 party in Downing Street, where the prime minister lives and works. A report by a senior civil servant criticised failures of leadership in Downing Street, where officials and staff were issued with a total of 123 fines for breaking Covid rules on indoor gatherings during the pandemic. Some Conservative MPs had cited the war in Ukraine as a reason not to oust Mr Johnson from office in the confidence vote in Parliament on Monday. Rallying his MPs ahead of the vote, Mr Johnson said it was the wrong time for ""unforced domestic political drama"" when Ukraine was fighting Russian President Vladimir Putin's forces. Mr Johnson won the backing of 59% of his MPs, describing the result as ""extremely good, positive, conclusive"" and insisting his leadership was now secure. However, those who had voted against Mr Johnson said the scale of the rebellion had weakened his authority, with some calling on him to resign. Reacting to Monday night's result, cabinet minister Nadhim Zahawi said he thought President Zelensky would be ""punching the air because he knows his great ally Boris Johnson will be prime minister tomorrow morning"". Those comments were criticised by some MPs, including Labour's Karl Turner, who urged Mr Zahawi to apologise for dragging the Ukrainian president ""into this Tory party civil war"". On Monday, ahead of the confidence vote, Mr Johnson called Mr Zelensky to discuss Ukraine's defence of its eastern Donbas region, where Russian forces are advancing. In a tweet, Mr Johnson wrote: ""We're unwavering in our mission of ensuring Ukraine is defended and supported for the long-term."" The UK's military support to Ukraine amounts to £750m so far and includes thousands of anti-tank missiles, 20 armoured vehicles, 4.5 tonnes of plastic explosives, and electronic warfare kit. On top of this, the UK says it is providing £220m of humanitarian assistance to Ukraine. As a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP), the UK was the sixth largest donor of aid to Ukraine globally between January and May, according to research by the Kiel Institute for the World Economy. Last month, the UK government said it would offer further aid and military support to Ukraine worth £1.3bn to boost the country's defence against Russia. Ukrainian commentators and officials expressed relief that Mr Johnson had won Monday's confidence vote, with some noting that UK had become a key arms supplier for the country. Mykhaylo Podolyak, one of Mr Zelensky's advisers, tweeted in English moments after the confidence vote. He wrote: ""Leadership is always a heavy burden. Boris Johnson was one of the first who realised the menace of Russia & stood by Volodymyr Zelensky to protect the free world from barbaric invasion. ""The world needs such leaders. The UK is a Great friend of Ukraine. British crown is a shield of democratic world."" "

Ministers plan to offer agricultural funding for environmental work. But NFU Cymru said it risked ""widespread"" land use change and farmers needed ongoing ""stability payments"" to grow food. The Welsh government said it was in an ""ongoing process of engagement"" with the industry. Ministers are due to unveil details of their long-awaited Sustainable Farming Scheme to replace EU-backed farm payments this summer. A first-of-its-kind Agriculture Bill for Wales is set to follow in September. NFU Cymru president Aled Jones said 2022 was a ""seminal year"" for the industry and, from a farming perspective, the new legislation would be ""the most important to go through the Senedd in its 23 years of existence"". Instead of offering direct payments to farms based on how much land they have, a new funding model is set to focus on rewarding work to deliver clean air and water quality, mitigate flood risks, fight climate change and boost biodiversity. Enhancing access to the countryside, protecting natural and historical landscapes as well as improving animal health and welfare will also lead to payouts. It is not yet clear how exactly this will work in practice and how individual farms will fare financially. But NFU Cymru is making a last-ditch appeal for some sort of direct payment to farms to be retained as part of the new system, as it hosts an event in the Senedd on Tuesday. Direct payments provided ""a key safety net for Welsh farmers"" in the past, it said, while the new scheme could lead to ""widespread land use change into forestry or… rewilding"", resulting in the displacement of people and communities. Mr Jones said revisions were needed to ensure levels of domestic food production were ""assessed, maintained and enhanced"" alongside the environmental commitments. ""Welsh agriculture makes an unparalleled contribution to our rural communities, economy, landscape, as well as to our national identity, our language and culture,"" he said. ""More than ever, in these difficult times, the continued supply of safe, high-quality, affordable food has to be a strategic priority for the nation."" Sheep farmer Gwawr Parry from Llanfair Caereinion in Powys said what she needed was ""a level of certainty, to understand a bit better what the plans are and what will be available to farms"". ""At the moment if we're looking at a five-year plan we wouldn't understand what we could achieve or invest in,"" she said, adding that the new scheme needed to be simple and open to all active farmers. Environmental groups have been pleased with the route the Welsh government is taking and do not want the reforms to get any less radical. Arfon Williams of RSPB Cymru said: ""Any short-term gains in food production at the expense of the environment will have a significant impact on food production in the medium and long term. ""This means any form of stability payment for farmers must support them to move towards a more sustainable farming model."" A Welsh government spokeswoman said stability payments for farmers would continue during and beyond this Senedd term as part of a transition to the new system, due to be introduced from spring 2023. ""Future farm support will reward farmers who take action to meet the challenges of the climate and nature emergencies in ways that make the sector more competitive and resilient,"" she added. ""The sustainable production of food and actions to deliver environmental outcomes are complementary, not competing agendas."" The Conservatives have called for a ""food summit"" to cope better with the consequences of the war in Ukraine and reduce the risk of shortages. Welsh Tory rural affairs spokesman Samuel Kurtz said ""we need all parts of the supply chain to get together, from producer to retailer, supported by the Welsh government, to develop a plan to ensure our high-quality Welsh produce continues to find its way onto the tables of the people of Wales"".

45,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-61718097,2022-06-07T09:57:12,New UK centre will help fight information war," A new centre aims to boost the UK's security through building expertise in cutting-edge technology. The Centre for Emerging Technology and Security (CETaS) will be based at the Alan Turing Institute, the UK's centre for data science and artificial intelligence. UK officials say it will help develop expertise outside government, including in publicly available information. This is proving vital in combating Russian disinformation over Ukraine. But concerns are also being raised about the government's current ""fragmented"" use of this type of open-source intelligence. There has been a widespread view that Moscow enjoyed the upper hand in using technology to fight an ""information war"" in recent years. The West appeared to be on the back foot since Russia weaponised social media to influence public opinion, most famously using fake accounts in the 2016 US presidential election. But the Ukraine conflict has revealed a shifting balance, officials say. ""In the current phase of the conflict, the balance of advantage is with those who seek the truth about progress in Russia's campaign,"" two anonymous government officials wrote in a paper issued to mark the launch of the new government-funded CETaS. A key reason has been what's called open-source intelligence. This relies on analysing publicly available data, like videos on social media, in contrast to ""secret"" intelligence that spies obtain through covert means like intercepting communications or running agents. ""The Ukrainian conflict has shown us the importance of data analysis and technology for exposing Russian disinformation campaigns,"" Paul Killworth, deputy chief scientific adviser for national security, told the BBC. ""Centres such as [CETaS] provide another tool in the armoury of open societies. It gives us more teams of specialists able to investigate claims."" US and UK governments have been active in using open-source information to be able to talk publicly about what their secret sources are indicating. But this type of information is most powerfully used by those outside government to reveal what is really happening on the ground. On the evening of 23 February, graduate students in Monterey, California, who had been using publicly available satellite imagery to watch Russian tanks on the border with Ukraine, saw Google Maps showing a traffic jam inching towards the Ukrainian border. They tweeted that a war seemed to have started, long before any official announcement. Since the conflict started, others have used data to investigate possible war crimes and to contest Russian narratives. The extent to which investigations have been pioneered by citizen-journalists and investigative groups like Bellingcat is a positive, according to Mr Killworth. ""If we went back perhaps a decade or so, if you were looking at advanced analytical capabilities, the ability to manage large amounts of data and conduct cutting-edge analysis, this was the preserve of government,"" he said. ""It was carried out behind barbed wire in very, very tightly controlled circumstances. A few decades on and the amount of cutting-edge, IT tools and analytics and open-source data available to investigative journalists, to citizens groups, to academics has grown dramatically."" Harnessing new technology to maintain an edge is part of the new centre's mission. This could include fields like automated recognition of military vehicles from satellite imagery or social media, allowing human experts to spend their time on trickier problems. Tools are already allowing greater translation and interpretation of foreign language material. Artificial Intelligence can also be used to reveal patterns in behaviour or language that indicate the presence of an organised disinformation network on social media. Dealing with these challenges at speed is one of the ambitions for the centre which aims to build a community that can keep pace with the growing amount of data and tools to exploit it. Another paper issued as part of the centre's launch, and jointly authored with the think tank RUSI, raises questions about whether government is organised to adequately exploit open-source intelligence. It warns of current ""fragmentation"" of activity within government and says it needs to be elevated to become a ""core"" intelligence discipline. One official told the authors that even though 35% of intelligence comes from open source, it receives only 1% of funding relative to classified sources. More focus needs to be made on building up the skills and breaking down barriers, with government analysts sometimes unable to access open-source information because of regulatory and technical constraints. A crucial problem is cultural bias. Intelligence agencies have often been reluctant to makes use of open-source information and decision makers are more likely to pay attention to a piece of information with ""SECRET"" stamped across it than something found online, even if it is just as relevant, the paper says. Experts also warn Russia is likely to adapt and up its game. This might mean spending more time amplifying real voices in the West which support its message, something which is harder for governments and social media companies to counter, or by developing better ""deepfake"" technology. Russia's narrative has also not been challenged within its own borders because it closed down its information space, and the government authors of the CETaS report say Moscow's messages may also be more effective beyond the West. ""Outside the Western ""information theatre"", Russia is having more success: audiences in China, India, Africa and the Middle East have a more sympathetic view of Russia's actions,"" they warn. "

He narrowly survived a shell blast. His Sergeant Major was killed on the spot. Yuri managed to warn his brothers-in-arms to take cover, but did not make it himself. He was 10 metres away from shelter when the rocket hit. ""I was at the very epicentre of that strike,"" he tells me from his hospital bed in Dnipro, four hours from the frontline in the Donbas region in the east of Ukraine. ""If it was up to me, I would stand up right now and go fight. I am really upset that my guys are fighting there, and I am just lying here, unable to help,"" he says. Fiery words, but Yuri is pale. His right arm is held together by metalwork to repair the bone. The surgeons tried to save his left foot, but they say the damage was too great. This 21-year-old will need a prosthetic foot if he is to get his wish and fight again for his country. But right now, there is a long line of those in need - both injured soldiers and civilians. ""Ukraine needs more help to purchase prosthetic components,"" says Yevhen Chehlakov from the Foundation for Social Protection of Persons with Disabilities. ""The country's budget in this area was allocated before the war and did not foresee this. One of our top priorities is to restore the lost functions of the wounded as soon as possible and return them to full life,"" he adds. It is difficult to get the scale of the problem. We asked Ukraine's Ministry of Defence to comment but they did not reply. The hospital in Dnipro is the closest to the frontline, but doctors here are instructed not to tell us how many wounded soldiers they are treating. Our visit is closely monitored by a press officer and we are restricted from asking any questions about civilian casualties or deaths. President Zelensky said last week that up to 100 Ukrainian soldiers are dying in combat every day, with about 500 more wounded. Surgeons and paramedics say the majority suffer from blast wounds. The Pirogov First Volunteer Mobile Hospital team are often first to treat soldiers wounded on the frontline in the Donbas region. ""It's hell out there,"" Hennadiy Druzenko from the group tells me. ""Unlike what we saw in the Kyiv region, there are almost no gunshot wounds - just horrendous mutilating injuries inflicted by shells, mortars, bombs, and grenades. It's horrifying how the technology of killing has advanced."" ""I see patients with terrible trauma,"" says Professor Oleksandr Loskutov from the National Academy of Medical Sciences of Ukraine. He is an orthopaedic surgeon in Dnipro, working around the clock to save as many people as he can. Some days, he sees up to 80 patients. ""Not everyone can be saved,"" he says quietly. But he believes that a solution for those who have lost limbs must be found within the country, not by sending patients to hospitals abroad. We visit a prosthetics factory in Dnipro built in 1944. Here, they are ready to increase production. ""The person receiving their first prosthetic limb has to be trained in using it. It's like with bicycles: it's not enough to just give someone a push bike for them to ride it. Someone has to provide training somewhere,"" says the director Oleksii Shtanko, as he gives me a tour. ""When someone gets admitted into our in-patient care and sees that there are others missing both legs or an arm, just like them, they see that life carries on. You can have a normal life with what modern technologies have to offer,"" he adds. There are also incredible success stories: surgeons' skills are saving limbs. Serhiy was hit by a mortar during a mission in Mariupol - a city which now lies in ruins and in Russian hands. I was shown the slides of Serhiy's injury. Most of his lower leg was gone, but the surgeons used parts of his thigh to rebuild it. ""The chances were slim,"" he tells me. His wife Yulia hadn't heard from him for two weeks when she got the call to come to the hospital. She keeps hold of his hand throughout the interview. She only lets go once, as Serhiy uses his crutches to show me he can walk very short distances. ""It's a miracle,"" Yulia says. But like Yuri, her husband can only think of getting back to the fight. Serhiy believes military rehabilitation rooms across Ukraine will be full of frustrated soldiers like him. I ask Yulia what she thinks about that. ""I support my husband totally. I am ready to move on and support everything that he is going to do,"" she tells me, still holding Serhei's hand. The toll taken by this war is matched by a strong will to overcome its effects. Many charities and organisations are ready to help. But it will take money and time, to ensure another cruel conflict does not haunt yet another generation of soldiers. "

Charles Michel said Russia was using food supplies as a ""stealth missile"" against the developing world, forcing people into poverty. The Russian envoy Vassily Nebenzia accused Mr Michel of spreading lies. The war has left food stuck at Ukrainian ports. Ukraine is a large exporter of cooking oil as well as cereals such as maize and wheat. Russia also exports vast amounts of grains as well as fertiliser. The lack of these exports has caused the price of alternatives to soar. ""Mr Ambassador of the Russian Federation, let's be honest, the Kremlin is using food supplies as a stealth missile against developing countries,"" Mr Michel said during the Security Council meeting in New York. ""The dramatic consequences of Russia's war are spilling over across the globe, and this is driving up food prices, pushing people into poverty, and destabilising entire regions. ""Russia is solely responsible for this food crisis."" He added that he had seen for himself the millions of tons of grain stuck in the Ukrainian port of Odesa because of a naval blockade enforced by Russia. Mr Michel also accused Russia of stealing grain and preventing crop planting and harvesting in Ukraine because of its military activities there. His comments led to Mr Nebenzia storming out. As he left, Mr Michel addressed him directly: ""You may leave the room, maybe it's easier not to listen to the truth"". Mr Nebenzia told Reuters he couldn't stay because of ""the lies that Charles Michel came here to distribute"". In a separate meeting, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken also said Russia was preventing Ukrainian grain exports from leaving the country and accused Russian forces of destroying Ukrainian agricultural infrastructure. Speaking during a virtual roundtable with philanthropists, non-governmental organisations and private sector entities, Mr Blinken said: ""There's somewhere around 20 million tons of wheat that's trapped in silos near Odesa, and in ships literally filled with grain that are stuck in the Odesa port because of this Russian blockade."" Like Mr Michel, he said there were credible reports that Russia was ""pilfering"" Ukraine's grain to sell for its own profit. "

The twin cities have been subjected to intense shelling in recent weeks which has damaged or destroyed most buildings, and most residents have left. Ukrainian forces were still holding out in Severodonetsk but were outnumbered by Russian forces, Mr Zelensky said. If captured, the two strategic targets would deliver Russian forces the entire Luhansk region in Ukraine's east. Both sides fought for the city in street-by-street battles on Monday as artillery shells rained from above. Read more here. The UK is to send a number of M270 long-range missile systems to Ukraine, the defence secretary has announced. Ben Wallace said the M270 multiple-launch rocket system will help Ukraine defend itself against Russia. The government has not confirmed how many weapons will be sent, but the BBC understands it will be three initially. The Ukrainian military will be trained to use the systems in the UK. Read more here about the weapons the UK is providing to Ukraine. The BBC's Steve Rosenberg questioned Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov about the Western announcements. He said the longer the range of the weapons systems, the further Ukrainian forces would be pushed back. He spoke of ""neo-Nazis"" threatening the Russian Federation, but claims by Russia that that neo-Nazism is rife in Ukraine have been dismissed by Kyiv and Western nations as baseless. Mr Lavrov was also in the news on Monday after his planned flight to Serbia was cancelled as a result of a flight ban by neighbouring countries. European Union member Bulgaria imposed the ban, along with North Macedonia and Montenegro, countries which like Serbia itself are hoping to join the EU. In a statement broadcast on Russian state TV, Mr Lavrov described the decision as ""unprecedented"" and said that ""no-one will be able to destroy our relations with Serbia"". Serbia has not joined the EU's wide-ranging sanctions against Russia, and remains friendly with Moscow. Like many other European countries, it relies heavily on Russian gas. In early March thousands of pro-Russian Serbs marched through Belgrade, reflecting the countries' traditionally close ties. Commenting on the move to bar Mr Lavrov's flight, a Russian foreign ministry source said ""our diplomacy has yet to master teleportation"". Russian state media have confirmed the death of one of Moscow's top generals during heavy fighting in Ukraine's eastern Donbas region. Maj Gen Roman Kutuzov was killed leading an assault on a Ukrainian settlement in the region, a state TV reporter said. The defence ministry has not commented on the reports. The general had led soldiers into attack, as if there are not enough colonels,"" Sladkov wrote on the Telegram social media app. ""On the other hand, Roman was the same commander as everyone else, albeit a higher rank."" Kyiv claims to have killed 12 generals and Western intelligence officials say at least seven senior commanders have been killed. Moscow has confirmed the deaths of four senior generals. Russian commanders have been increasingly forced to the front in an attempt to drive forward the invasion. Last month, the New York Times reported that the US had provided intelligence to Ukraine, allowing them to target a number of generals. "

They beat Ukraine 1-0 in Cardiff in a tense and dramatic game after Gareth Bale's deflected free-kick. Rob Page told his players that he ""loves them to bits"". As the reality of Sunday's achievement sank in, many jubilant fans on Monday said they thought they would never see this moment. Wales will share Group B with USA, Iran and England at the tournament in Qatar, starting in November. ""Even at the final whistle last night I was thinking... is this a cruel dream that I'm having?"" Page told BBC Radio Wales Breakfast. ""But then you realise that it's reality. ""It's one of those surreal moments when you wake up and then realise that we are off to the World Cup. It is unbelievable."" Wales have reached the World Cup only once before - in 1958 under Jimmy Murphy's management. Remarkably, both Murphy and Page are from Rhondda in the south Wales valleys, and grew up only a few miles apart. ""How spooky is that?"" said Page. ""Two people from the Rhondda: it was written in the stars, wasn't it? It's a special moment for me and my family."" He called the win ""massive"" for the country, adding: ""We've seen the tide has turned slightly with regards to football and rugby. ""I think football has become our number one sport. We'll always be known for rugby, of course we will, but this is massive - it's monumental what we've done."" Page also paid tribute to Gary Speed, who died in 2011 while Wales manager. Speed is often credited with having laid the foundations for the nation's current success, and Page said Sunday's match was for him and his family. That sentiment was echoed by former Wales manager Chris Coleman, who led Wales to the semi-finals of Euro 2016. ""He [Speed] put a lot of things in place. I know I benefited from that, I'm sure Ryan Giggs and Pagey did too,"" he said. Ffion Owen, who watched the game in Cardiff, said: ""I don't think I had any more to cry, it was euphoria, it was a dream that you can't imagine happening until it happens."" Rhodri Ogwen Williams, who lives in Qatar, said it was an emotional moment for him after he lost his father last year. ""I believe my dad's spirit was in (goalkeeper) Wayne Hennessey's hands last night. It was a beautiful, beautiful moment."" Rhodri, a sports broadcaster, said many Welsh fans were watching the game from his restaurant and ""everybody is so welcome"" to Qatar. ""The Wales fans are going to have the time of their life,"" he added. ""It was amazing... it was fab,"" said Chelsea Wadeson, of Wrexham. ""I don't think we'll be going to Qatar but we'll definitely be watching them. We were so chuffed."" Phil Higgins, from Wrexham, said watching the game was ""fabulous"". ""It's great isn't it, but a bit unexpected as well. They hung in there and obviously the crowd was a big factor."" For Gaynor Williams, travelling to Qatar is out of the question, but her sons who are avid Wales supporters may take the trip. ""It's fantastic, 64 years since they've done it. Brilliant. Well done to them, they deserve it."" The victory was also marked with sympathy for Ukraine and their fans. Ukraine had hoped to make the final step to the World Cup after reaching the play-off via a 3-1 win over Scotland last Wednesday in their first competitive clash since Russia's invasion. But their hopes were crushed after several missed chances and a standout performance by the Wales keeper. ""[There is] strong disappointment. Many people wanted this victory, this victory was very necessary for the Ukrainian people,"" said 32-year-old Pavlo, who watched the game from a pub in Kyiv. ""I think the guys have given their all. The statistics show that the advantage was on our side. But bad luck, it happens,"" he told AFP minutes after it ended. Another fan said: ""The guys fought... and today we have much more important battles on the battlefield."" Ukraine fans had praised the home supporters for their welcome in Cardiff and 100 refugees were given free tickets to see the game. Wales' First Minister Mark Drakeford said it would be ""an opportunity for us to reaffirm our support for Ukraine as it fights Russia's unprovoked and brutal act of war"". There were divided loyalties in one Welsh household on Sunday night. Svitlana Phillips, who is from Ukraine, said she felt ""a little bit disappointed"" but Wales were ""very generous, supportive and know how to share their win"". Her husband Paul, from Swansea, said there was ""quite a bit of rivalry"" and it was his wife who ""walked out on a few occasions"" during the nerve-wracking match. But Mrs Phillips will now be supporting Wales in Qatar. Welsh fans at the Hawk and Buckle pub, in Llannefydd near Denbigh, also showed their support by having a whip-round to raise money for the Ukrainian people. When Welsh celebrations subsided a little at the small Conwy pub, the 25 or so locals donated £200. The money will be given to the Ukraine appeal. "

Both sides fought for the city in street-by-street battles on Monday as artillery shells rained from above. The intensity of fighting there and in nearby Lysychansk has made them both ""dead cities"", Mr Zelensky said. If captured, the two strategic targets would deliver Russian forces the entire Luhansk region in Ukraine's east. Since pulling its forces back from the Kyiv region in March, Russia has refocused its military efforts on Ukraine's eastern Donbas making slow advances there in recent weeks. Despite the Russians' superior numbers, Mr Zelensky said the Ukrainian defenders were holding out and had ""every chance"" of fighting back. Artillery strikes have also intensified on neighbouring Lysychansk, which Mr Zelensky said he had visited on Sunday as part of a tour of the eastern front line. An elderly resident in the city, Oleksandr Lyakhovets, said a Russian missile had struck his flat soon after, engulfing it in flames. ""They shoot here endlessly... It's a horror show,"" the 67-year-old told AFP news agency. Russian forces have made slow progress in Ukraine's eastern Donbas in recent weeks. Their troops currently control almost all of the Luhansk region as well as a significant proportion of the neighbouring Donetsk region. The two regions make up the Donbas. Fighting has been slow and bloody with both sides sustaining significant losses. Russian state media said on Sunday that one of the army's top officials, Maj Gen Roman Kutuzov, had been killed while leading an offensive on an unspecified Ukrainian town in the region. Western countries have responded to the grinding conflict with pledges to send even more advanced, long-range weapons to Kyiv that they hope will bolster Ukraine's defensive capacity in the east. On Monday the UK confirmed that long-range missile systems would be included for the first time in the next batch of military aid that it is sending to Ukraine. Russian President Vladimir Putin has said he considers any delivery of long-range weapons by Western countries to be a deliberate attempt to prolong the conflict. He said Russia would respond by expanding the list of targets that it was striking across Ukraine if longer-range weapons were sent to his adversaries. In Mariupol, which was captured by Russia in May after a months-long siege, the Associated Press news agency is reporting that dozens of corpses belonging to soldiers who had been defending the city's Azovstal steel mill had finally been returned to Kyiv where they were undergoing DNA tests. Other soldiers who survived the siege were taken to Russian-controlled areas. On Monday, Mr Zelensky said that more than 2,500 of them were being held as prisoners of war. Residents in the now Russian-controlled port city have been facing a growing humanitarian crisis, compounded by severe shortages of food and water. On Monday a Ukrainian official said contamination from decomposing corpses and rubbish had sparked a cholera outbreak - prompting a city-wide quarantine. ""We are seeing the city get closed off,"" said Petro Andryushchenko, who is an adviser to the city's mayor, to United News TV. ""The word 'cholera' is being mentioned inside the city, among occupying authorities and their handlers,"" he added. The BBC has not been able to independently verify this claim. "

Almost seven million left for neighbouring countries, while eight million people are displaced inside Ukraine itself. However, millions of Ukrainians have also been returning to their home country - especially to cities like Kyiv, which Russian forces are no longer targeting. People are still crossing to neighbouring countries, especially those to the west. The UN says that, of 1 June, more than 6.9 million refugees have left Ukraine and 2.1 million have returned: (Some people who travelled from Moldova into Romania are included in both countries' totals). Poland, Hungary and Slovakia have open borders with other EU countries, under the Schengen agreement. Many refugees who first arrived in these countries have since moved on to others. The Czech Republic has taken in 361,560 Ukrainian refugees. And more than 780,000 Ukrainians are in Germany, 40% of whom are children. Some Ukrainians have travelled to Russia from the pro-Russian breakaway regions of Luhansk and Donetsk in the east. President Vladimir Putin says his forces helped evacuate 140,000 civilians from Mariupol but insists no one was forced to go to Russia. However, volunteer groups such as Rubikus and Helping to Leave say they have helped hundreds of Ukrainians who ended up in Russia to travel onto other countries. The EU has granted Ukrainians the right to stay and work throughout its 27 member nations for up to three years. Refugees are housed in reception centres if they can't stay with friends or relatives. They are given food and medical care, and information about onward travel. They are entitled to social welfare payments and access to housing, medical treatment and schools. Poland, which has taken the highest number of refugees, and Moldova, which has the largest concentration of refugees by population, have both asked for international support to help fund their efforts. The UN says that as of 1 June, 2,102,247 million Ukrainians have returned to Ukraine. Ukraine's border force says people are crossing back into the country at a rate of about 30,000 a day. Some are returning to areas of Ukraine such as the capital Kyiv, which were threatened by Russian army advances at the start of the war but which are now considered safer. Kyiv's mayor, Vitali Klitschko, says the city's population is back to two-thirds of its pre-war level. The UN's International Organisation for Migration (IOM) said at the start of May that more than eight million people were internally displaced. The IOM said: It estimates that more than half of the people who are internally displaced are women. Many are particularly vulnerable because they are pregnant, have a disability or are a victim of violence. The UN is working alongside other organisations to provide cash, food and other supplies. The UK introduced a family visa scheme for Ukrainians who have an immediate or extended family member in the UK. After the government response was criticised, it launched the Homes for Ukraine scheme to allow those without relatives in the UK to settle. It lets people in the UK nominate an individual or family to stay with them rent-free for at least six months. Refugees who come via the scheme will be able to live and work in the UK for up to three years, and have access to healthcare, welfare and schools. Applications are made online, and both hosts and refugees are vetted. Hosts receive £350 a month. Many families who have applied to be sponsors have complained that the system is too slow and complicated. As of 24 May, 115,000 Ukrainian visas had been issued, out of 135,600 applications, and as at 23 May, 60,100 visa holders had arrived in the UK. "

Most of the 30 existing Nato countries are keen for them to join, although Turkey is against their membership and says they support anti-Turkish terrorists. Nato - the North Atlantic Treaty Organization - is a defensive military alliance. It was formed in 1949 by 12 countries, including the US, UK, Canada and France. Finland and Sweden would take it to 32 members. Members agree to help one another if they come under armed attack. Nato's original aim was to counter Russian expansion in Europe after World War Two. Following the Soviet Union's collapse in 1991, many of its former Eastern European allies joined Nato. Both countries have been neutral for many years. However, public support for joining Nato has grown since Russia invaded Ukraine. It can take a year to apply and become a Nato member, and all member states must agree that a new country can join. Member must be democracies, treat minorities fairly and commit to resolving conflicts peacefully. They must also provide military support to the alliance. Both Finland - which has a 1,340km (830 mile) border with Russia - and Sweden have highly capable militaries. Nato members agree to spend 2% of their GDP on defence. Finland already meets this target and Sweden says it will do so ""as soon as possible"". Turkey, says it will refuse to let in either Sweden or Finland. Its president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, says the two countries have been harbouring members of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), a group it views as a terrorist organisation. However, the US says it is confident Finland and Sweden will both join, despite Turkish objections. The UK is sending long-range missiles to Ukraine, fired from an M270 multiple-launch rocket system. It can launch 12 surface-to-surface missiles within a minute and strike targets up to 50 miles (80km) away. The US has said it will send Ukraine a similar weapon - the M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System. Russia has protested, saying the rockets could hit targets within Russia. It has threatened to expand the list of its targets in Ukraine in response. However, the US has told Ukrainian forces only to fire the rockets against targets in Ukrainian territory. The UK and US have also sent thousands of anti-tank missiles and anti-aircraft missiles. They and other Nato countries are also sending drones, artillery, armoured vehicles and electronic warfare equipment. As Ukraine isn't a member, Nato isn't obliged to come to its defence. Nato countries fear that if their troops confront Russian forces, it could lead to an all-out conflict between Russia and the West. This is also why Nato rejected a no-fly zone over Ukraine. Nato offered Ukraine a path towards membership in 2008. After Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014, Ukraine made joining a priority. But this has not happened, mainly because of Russia's long-standing opposition. Russia believes Nato has been encroaching on its area of political influence by accepting new members from eastern Europe - and thinks that admitting Ukraine would bring Nato into its backyard. Ukraine's President Zelensky has accepted his country can't join Nato at present, saying: ""It is clear that Ukraine is not a member of Nato. We understand this."" Nato already had troops stretching from the Baltic in the north to Romania in the south. They had been stationed there in 2014, after Russia's annexation of Crimea. Nato has now sent elements of its 40,000-strong Response Force to countries bordering Russia and Ukraine. It has fighter jets on alert and naval ships, including aircraft carrier groups, patrolling the seas. "

Maj Gen Roman Kutuzov was killed leading an assault on a Ukrainian settlement in the region, a reporter with the state-owned Rossiya 1 said. Alexander Sladkov said Gen Kutuzov had been commanding troops from the self-declared Donetsk People's Republic. Russia's defence ministry has not commented on the reports. ""The general had led soldiers into attack, as if there are not enough colonels,"" Mr Sladkov wrote on the Telegram social media app. ""On the other hand, Roman was the same commander as everyone else, albeit a higher rank."" Ukraine's military also confirmed the killing of Gen Kutuzov, without offering further details about the circumstances. His death comes as rumours circulated on social media that a second senior officer, Lt Gen Roman Berdnikov, commander of the 29th Army, was also killed in fighting over the weekend. The BBC cannot independently verify the claims. Russian commanders have been increasingly forced to the front in an attempt to drive forward the invasion and Moscow has confirmed the deaths of four senior generals. Kyiv claims to have killed 12 generals and Western intelligence officials say at least seven senior commanders have been killed. But there has been confusion over reports of the deaths of several other Russian officers. Three generals that Ukrainian forces claimed to have killed have subsequently been reported to be alive. In March, Ukrainian forces said Maj Gen Vitaly Gerasimov had been killed outside the country's second city of Kharkiv. However, on 23 May Russian state media said he had been awarded a state honour and dismissed reports of his death. Another commander, Maj Gen Magomed Tushaev, also appeared to be still alive and periodically appears in videos posted to social media. And on 18 March, Kyiv alleged that Lt Gen Andrey Mordvichev had been killed in an airstrike in the Kherson region. However, he later appeared in a video meeting with Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov and on 30 May BBC Russia confirmed that he was still alive. The deaths of generals are rarely officially acknowledged in Russia. In the case of Maj Gen Vladimir Frolov, no information about his death had appeared in state media prior to his funeral in St Petersburg in April. Russia lists military deaths as state secrets even in times of peace and has not updated its official casualty figures in Ukraine since 25 March, when it said that 1,351 Russian soldiers had been killed since President Vladimir Putin launched his invasion of Ukraine on 24 February. In March, an official within President Volodymyr Zelensky's inner circle told the Wall Street journal that a team of Ukrainian military intelligence officers had been tasked with locating and targeting Russia's officer class. ""They look for high profile generals, pilots, artillery commanders,"" the official said. They added that the officers were then targeted either with sniper fire or artillery. Last month, the New York Times reported that the US has provided intelligence to Ukraine, allowing them to target a number of the generals who have been killed in action. Lt Gen Yakov Rezantsev was reportedly killed by a Ukrainian strike on the Chornobaivka airbase near the city of Kherson. He was promoted to lieutenant general last year, and was commander of the 49th combined army of Russia's southern military district. He is said to have taken part in Russia's military operation in Syria. Maj Gen Oleg Mityaev reportedly died somewhere near the city of Mariupol, a city in south-east Ukraine which was the scene of a protracted Russian siege. The nationalist Azov regiment claimed to have killed him. He was a commander of the Russian army's 150th motorised rifle division, a relatively new unit formed in 2016, and based in the Rostov region close to the Ukrainian border. Ukraine claims that the unit was created in order to take part in the conflict in separatist-controlled areas of eastern Ukraine, although Russia denies that its military was involved in fighting there. Maj Gen Andrei Kolesnikov, of the 29th combined army, was killed in fighting on 11 March, according to official Ukrainian sources. The circumstances of his death were not given. After Kolesnikov became the third Russian general reportedly killed in Ukraine, one western official told the Press Association that the Russian army may be suffering from low morale, which is why high-ranking military officers are moving closer to the front line. Maj Gen Andrey Sukhovetsky, a deputy commander at the same unit as Gerasimov, was reportedly killed by a sniper on 3 March. Like Gerasimov, Sukhovetsky was part of Russia's military operations in Crimea and in Syria. Unlike the other generals, Sukhovetsky's death was reported in the Russian media and Russian President Vladimir Putin confirmed in a speech that a general had died in Ukraine. "

The group, from Hayling Island Sailing Club, say they want to sponsor more families but are being held up by ""tortuous"" administrative barriers. They described one application as being ""lost in a black hole for months"". A government spokesperson said visa cases differ in complexity and offered its ""deepest sympathies"" to those affected by the war. Club member Steve McLean first travelled to Poland after Ukraine was invaded to deliver donations gathered by club members for refugees. While delivering the supplies, he met a number of Ukrainian families in need of UK hosts and began offering a matching service. Mr McLean, a businessman from Brighton, liaised with members back in Hayling Island to finds homes for 10 families through the sailing club community. Olena Kasian, 23, said Mr McLean helped her and her family find Emma Toman, who is now hosting them at her home on the island. She said it feels ""quiet and safe"" living by the sea, after escaping Kryvyi Rih in southern Ukraine with her mother Natalia, sister Ana and nephew Vlad in April. Miss Kasian added: ""In our city there is no sea, so it's so interesting for us. I always dreamed of living near the sea."" Along with several others, Olena has been given an honorary membership to Hayling Island Sailing Club, as well as a job. Her nephew, 15-year-old Vlad, also enjoys life by the sea but said he ""thinks a lot"" about returning home. He said: ""I left a lot of friends in Ukraine and a lot of my friends are in Germany and in Poland right now. I think a lot about my return to Ukraine, when it will be? I don't know."" Having found homes for 10 families, Mr McLean is keen to continue helping, but says the visa process is taking ""far too long"". In March he put in an application to sponsor a traumatised family who escaped from Bucha. ""It just went into a black hole for months,"" he said. ""We thought the application covered the whole family, and then we received correspondence from the Home Office to say the children weren't covered, and had to make their own application."" After the BBC contacted the Home Office about the case, the children were granted a rare visa waiver allowing them to travel to the UK with their mother, who had already been approved for a visa. Mr McLean said while he was pleased the family's case had been resolved, the visa application process was ""incredibly tortuous, unnecessarily complicated and obstructive"". A government spokesperson said: ""Every life lost in this conflict is a tragedy and our deepest sympathies go out to everyone who has been affected by Putin's barbaric war.

EU member Bulgaria imposed the flight ban, along with North Macedonia and Montenegro - countries hoping, like Serbia, to join the EU. Russia's invasion of Ukraine triggered an EU airspace ban in February. Mr Lavrov has blamed ""the Brussels puppeteers"" for the latest move. Serbia has not joined the EU's wide-ranging sanctions against Russia, and remains friendly with the nation. The EU and UK imposed a blanket flight ban on Russian planes - including the private jets of oligarchs - days after the 24 February invasion. Like many other European countries, Serbia relies heavily on Russian gas. Mr Lavrov was to have had talks in Belgrade with President Aleksandar Vucic on 6-7 June. In a statement broadcast on Russian state news channel Rossiya 24, he described the decision as ""unprecedented"" and said that ""no one will be able to destroy our relations with Serbia"". He also said: ""It seems that the Brussels puppeteers very much did not want to again give us a platform so that in the capital of Serbia we could confirm Russia's position on the problem of Kosovo and the problem of Bosnia-Herzegovina. ""They probably did not want us to express support for Belgrade's initiative to realise the open Balkans project in the interests of making healthier, stronger relations between all the countries of the region."" The Kremlin strongly backs Serbia's refusal to recognise Kosovo's independence. Russia was angered by the Nato bombing campaign against Serbia in 1999 during the Kosovo war. In his statement on Monday, Mr Lavrov accused Nato and the EU of wanting to ""turn the Balkans into their own project called closed Balkans."" Commenting on the move to bar Mr Lavrov's flight, a Russian foreign ministry source said ""our diplomacy has yet to master teleportation"". Serbia's interior minister, Aleksandar Vulin, said he deeply regretted the ""obstruction"" of Lavrov's visit, adding ""Serbia is proud that it is not part of the anti-Russian hysteria"". In early March thousands of pro-Russian Serbs marched through Belgrade, reflecting the countries' traditionally close ties. "
58,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-61482305,2022-06-06T09:48:22,What weapons are being given to Ukraine by the UK?," The UK is sending multiple-launch rocket systems to Ukraine for the first time. The government says the weapons will help Ukrainians to protect themselves against Russian artillery. Thousands of frontline Ukrainian troops are now using weapons and other equipment supplied by the UK. The government says it is spending £1.3bn ($1.6bn) on military support for Ukraine. So what exactly is being sent, and how much of a difference is it making? UK Defence Secretary Ben Wallace confirmed the donation of M270 multiple-launch rocket systems with M31A1 precision munitions to Ukraine on 6 June. The government says that Ukrainian troops will be trained how to use the weapons in the UK. There has been no official confirmation of how many weapons will be sent, but the BBC understands it will be three initially. Jack Watling of the Royal United Services Institute (Rusi) says: ""These systems are precisely what Ukraine needs. They allow the Ukrainians to out-range a lot of the Russian artillery systems and also to strike with precision."" ""That means the Ukrainians can start to knock out and hold at risk the Russian artillery that is at the moment systematically destroying towns across eastern Ukraine,"" he adds. The UK has sent more than 5,000 next generation light anti-tank weapons, or Nlaw, to Ukraine. Nlaws are designed to destroy tanks at short range with a single shot. Crucially for Ukraine's armed forces who need weapons immediately, the missiles are easy to transport and simple to use. A soldier can be trained to use them in less than a day. Many analysts believe they have already had a major impact on the course of the conflict. ""Nlaw was absolutely critical to the defeat of Russian ground thrusts in the early stages of the war,"" says Rusi's Justin Bronk. The weapons have been ""particularly effective"" when used in combination with artillery, he says. Defence minister James Heappey confirmed that ""hundreds"" of Brimstone missiles would be sent to Ukraine on 28 April. Brimstones can be used against tanks, artillery and some smaller vessels such as landing craft, according to Capt Chris Carlson, formerly of the US Navy. The missiles are normally fired from aircraft, but in Ukraine they are being modified to be fired from trucks. Launching them from the ground reduces their effective range, says Capt Carlson. If used as anti-ship missiles, Brimstones are far too small to sink larger vessels, but could cause substantial damage. ""It all depends where you hit,"" he says. ""If you went through an engine or near the water line, you could give an enemy some serious trouble."" Britain has donated 120 armoured vehicles to Ukraine, including Mastiff patrol vehicles. Mastiffs were very popular among British troops in Afghanistan as they provide a high level of protection against landmines and improvised explosive devices. Analysts say that in an area which as been as heavily mined as the Donbas, Mastiffs are likely to be very useful. It is understood that both sides in the conflict have used landmines extensively. The Ministry of Defence says it is supplying ""dozens"" of heavy lift unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) systems to provide logistical support to isolated forces. Analysts say that drones can be very effective in getting supplies over the ""last mile"" to front line troops, particularly under threat of Russian artillery fire and in situations where there is a risk of encirclement. ""It's the sheer quantity of stuff needed by troops,"" says Mr Bronk. ""Every time you can use a drone instead of a soldier to get supplies forward is one less time someone is exposed to extreme danger."" Britain says it has donated five air defence systems, including Starstreak missiles. Starstreak is designed to bring down low-flying aircraft at short range. It ignores counter-measures such as flares and chaff deployed by many aircraft. ""From a pilot's point of view, Starstreak is a very unpleasant thing,"" says Mr Bronk. ""There's very little you can do about it."" He says Russian forces may deem some operations too risky if they are aware that a weapon as deadly as Starstreak is on the ground. However, Starstreak requires much more training than systems such as Nlaw, and is no substitute, say analysts, for longer-range air defence systems. Britain is also supplying a ""small number"" of tracked Stormer vehicles to act as a mobile platform for Starstreak missiles. Sustaining supplies of Western equipment, weapons and ammunition will be extremely important to the Ukrainians in the longer term, according to retired Brig Ben Barry, of the International Institute of Strategic Studies. He says that although Ukraine has some weapons manufacturing capacity of its own, it will be difficult for its troops to take significant territory back from Russian forces without substantial outside support. Military professionals point out that Ukraine's need is largely for equipment which its troops already know how to use, or can be trained on very quickly. Much of Ukraine's weaponry was designed and manufactured in former Warsaw Pact countries. For this reason, the UK has offered to send British Challenger 2 tanks to Poland to backfill its donations of T-72 tanks to Ukraine. Ukraine's armed forces have been using T-72s for decades and have maintenance and spare parts capabilities, in addition to trained crew. In the days shortly before and after Russia's invasion of Ukraine, UK ministers insisted that supplies to Ukraine would be confined to ""defensive"" weapons. That means weapons which can only be used to defend Ukraine from attack, and not to attack Russia. The government has signalled that it is moving away from purely defensive supplies, but some experts question the whole distinction. ""There is no such thing as a purely defensive weapon,"" says Brig Barry. ""Defensive weapons are also offensive, because they can defend equipment being used to mount an attack."" Other equipment supplied by the UK includes: Graphics by Gerry Fletcher. "

Ben Wallace said the M270 multiple-launch rocket system will help Ukraine defend itself against Russia. The government has not confirmed how many weapons will be sent, but the BBC understands it will be three initially. The decision comes after the US announced last week it was also supplying a rocket system. The move by the US to send its own M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) has already angered Moscow and on Sunday Russian President Vladimir Putin threatened to expand the list of targets Russia will attack in Ukraine in response. The UK government said the Ukrainian military will get training in the UK on how to use the launchers. The multiple-launch rocket system can fire 12 surface-to-surface missiles within a minute and can strike targets within 50 miles (80km) with pinpoint accuracy - far further than the artillery Ukraine currently possesses. Mr Wallace said the UK was taking a leading role in supplying Ukrainian troops with the ""vital weapons they need to defend their country from unprovoked invasion"". He said: ""As Russia's tactics change, so must our support to Ukraine. ""These highly capable multiple-launch rocket systems will enable our Ukrainian friends to better protect themselves against the brutal use of long-range artillery, which Putin's forces have used indiscriminately to flatten cities."" The UK and US have led the way in supplying weapons to Ukraine, but giving it advanced long range rockets marks a significant shift, said the BBC's defence correspondent Jonathan Beale. It is also a recognition that Ukraine is struggling to compete against Russia's vast artillery arsenal, he added. Last week, Washington said it would supply four HIMARS multiple rocket launchers to Ukraine - following receipt of guarantees they would be used for defensive purposes only and not to strike targets inside Russia. The same restriction applies to the use of the UK's M270 system. In an interview on Russian state TV on Sunday, Mr Putin said: ""In general, all this fuss about additional arms supplies, in my opinion, has only one goal - to drag out the armed conflict as long as possible."" The Russian leader said that if missiles with longer ranges did arrive in Ukraine, his country would ""draw appropriate conclusions"" and ""strike at those targets that we are not striking yet"". The warning came as explosions shook parts of Kyiv on Sunday in the first assault on the capital city for weeks, while fierce fighting for control of key towns and cities in the eastern Donbas region continues. Russia refocused its military efforts on the Donbas at the end of March after pulling back from the Kyiv region. Some of the fiercest fighting is currently in the eastern city of Severodonetsk. Capturing the city would deliver the Luhansk region to Russian forces and their local separatist allies, who also control much of neighbouring Donetsk. The two regions form the heavily industrial Donbas. On Sunday, Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelensky, said he had visited front-line troops in the eastern Donbas region to the city of Lysychansk and the town of Soledar. The UK has also delivered more than 5,000 next generation light anti-tank weapons - known as Nlaw - which analysts believe have been critical to Ukraine driving back Russian ground assaults since the war began. Other weapon systems delivered by the government include short-range Brimstone 1 missiles, Mastiff armoured vehicles and Starstreak missile air defence systems - with the overall military support to Ukraine costing £750m so far, the government said. Several other countries have pledged to send advanced weapons to Ukraine. Germany has promised to send its most modern air defence system - the Iris-T - to enable Ukraine to shield an entire city from Russian air attacks. Meanwhile, a specialist team of lawyers and police officers will be offered to assist the chief prosecutor investigating alleged Russian war crimes in Ukraine, the Justice Secretary Dominic Raab announced on Monday. The offer will include a Metropolitan Police officer stationed in the International Criminal Court in The Hague, in the Netherlands - who will provide the ICC's prosecutor Karim Khan with greater access to British police and military expertise. Seven lawyers experienced in international criminal law will be offered to help uncover evidence of war crimes committed in Ukraine and prosecute those responsible. The ICC has already begun an investigation that may target senior Russian officials thought to be responsible for war crimes, crimes against humanity or genocide. "

The warning came as explosions shook parts of Kyiv on Sunday in the first air strikes on the capital for weeks. Russia says it hit tanks supplied by European countries. Ukraine says it was a railway repair plant. In another development, a Russian general was killed in fighting in the Donbas region. Russia refocused its military efforts on the Donbas at the end of March after pulling back from the Kyiv region. As Russia makes slow but steady progress on the ground there - hundreds of kilometres to the east - several countries have pledged to send advanced weapons to Kyiv. Most recently, the US announced it was sending the M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS), which fires precision-guided rockets that can hit targets up to 70km (45 miles) away - far further than the artillery Ukraine currently possesses. White House officials say they agreed to provide the rockets only after gaining assurances from President Volodymyr Zelensky that they would not be used to attack targets inside Russia. The package also includes helicopters, anti-tank weapons, tactical vehicles and spare parts. Germany also promised to send its most modern air defence system - the Iris-T - to enable Ukraine to shield an entire city from Russian air attacks. In an interview on Russian state TV on Sunday, Mr Putin said: ""In general, all this fuss about additional arms supplies, in my opinion, has only one goal - to drag out the armed conflict as long as possible."" The Russian leader said what the US was supplying was ""nothing new"". But he warned against sending missiles with longer ranges: ""If they are supplied, we will draw appropriate conclusions from this and use our weapons, of which we have enough, to strike at those targets that we are not striking yet."" Ukraine's deputy defence minister asked Western countries to keep up a steady supply of weapons to help defeat Russia. ""We have already entered into a protracted war and we will need constant support. The West must understand that its help cannot be a one-time thing, but something that continues until our victory,"" Hanna Malyar told local media. Some of the fiercest fighting is currently in the eastern city of Severodonetsk. Capturing the city would deliver the Luhansk region to Russian forces and their local separatist allies, who also control much of neighbouring Donetsk. The two regions form the heavily industrial Donbas. Luhansk's governor Serhiy Haidai said Ukrainian forces held about half of Severodonetsk, having pushed Russian forces back. He said 15,000 people remained in the city, but evacuation was ""currently impossible"". President Volodymyr Zelensky said he visited Lyshchansk, the town which faces Severodonetsk across the Donets river, on Sunday as part of a new tour of the front lines which also took in Zaporizhzhia in the south. ""I am proud of everybody I met, everyone I shook hands with, everyone with whom I connected and had expressed my support,"" he said in a video released by his press service. Maj-Gen Roman Kutuzov, a Russian airborne forces commander, was killed leading separatist troops of the unrecognised Donetsk People's Republic, Russian state TV reports. According to separatists, he was killed on Sunday at the village of Mykolaivka in the Popasna area, near Severodonetsk. The Ukrainian military said it had fought off assaults in the area on Sunday, inflicting substantial losses. Russian state TV said Kutuzov was the fourth Russian general to die in the Ukraine fighting, while Ukraine itself says it has killed as many as 12 Russian generals since the invasion began on 24 February. Tens of thousands of people have been killed and millions forced to flee their homes, despite diplomatic efforts to bring about a ceasefire. "

""If everyone starts to impose export restrictions... that would worsen the crisis,"" German Food and Agriculture Minister Cem Ozdemir said after the ban was announced in May. But India's Commerce Minister, Piyush Goyal, says the export ban should not affect global markets because it is not a major wheat exporter. So what has been the impact of India's move? India's ban was announced on 13 May, after unseasonably hot weather affected the wheat crop, sending local prices soaring. Although India is not a major wheat exporter, the move unsettled global markets with the Chicago benchmark wheat index rising by nearly 6%. The prices of some of the main types of wheat rose for several days, peaking on 17 to 18 May. Wheat prices had risen throughout March and April after the Russian invasion of Ukraine, as had the prices of other foodstuffs. Disruption caused by the war means that millions of tonnes of wheat have been unable to leave Ukraine, which is one of the world's biggest exporters. Kelly Goughary, of the agriculture data research group Gro Intelligence, explains that India's ban led to a further price surge because ""global buyers were depending on supplies from India after exports from the Black Sea region plunged"". India is the world's second biggest wheat producer, but accounts for less than 1% of the global wheat trade. It keeps a lot of it to provide subsidised food for the poor. But just before announcing the ban, India was aiming to boost exports by shipping a record 10 million tonnes of wheat this year - compared with just two million last year. It was offering supplies to new markets in Asia and Africa, and even after the ban, several countries said they were in touch with India to keep exports going. India says some countries will still receive wheat exports, and that it will ""continue to assist neighbours in their hour of need."" Its top export markets are Bangladesh, Nepal and Sri Lanka - as well as the United Arab Emirates (UAE). In 2019-20, Sri Lanka and UAE imported more than 50% of their wheat from India, according to the Observatory of Economic Complexity (OEC), and Nepal imported more than 90%. It is not yet clear whether these countries will still get Indian wheat under existing contracts, or will receive supplies under future deals. However, Egypt says that government purchases of Indian wheat will continue. It's one of the biggest importers of wheat globally. The International Monetary Fund has called on India to reconsider the export ban, saying it could play a significant role in helping alleviate the current wheat supply crisis for those countries most affected by the war in Ukraine. Apart from the war in Ukraine, the weather has had an impact in some major wheat-exporting countries. ""Drought, floods and heat waves threaten crops in some other major producers [US, Canada and France],"" says Kelly Goughary of Gro Intelligence. Global wheat production for the 2022-23 period will be the lowest for four years, and global stocks of wheat are predicted to be at their lowest for six years, according to a US government report. Gro Intelligence also points out that global fertiliser prices have tripled over the past year, risking ""significant"" reductions in crop yields this year. It estimates that this - together with other factors - means global wheat stocks are down to their lowest level since the 2008 financial crisis. China - the world's largest producer of wheat for its huge population - said in March that its winter crop could be the ""worst in history"" because of heavy rainfall in 2021. There is still uncertainty about the actual state of the harvest, and whether or not it will be badly affected. But if it is, China may want to buy on global markets to build up its stocks, further tightening global supplies and pushing up prices. Read more from Reality Check Send us your questions "

A deflected Gareth Bale free-kick was enough to secure a 1-0 win over Ukraine in Cardiff, and send Welsh supporters into raptures. Fans leaving the Cardiff City Stadium sang and cheered joyously in the rain as the reality of making it to the Qatar finals later this year sank in. Many supporters said they never thought they would see this moment. Wales' First Minister Mark Drakeford, actor Michael Sheen, presenter Gabby Logan, and a wealth of Welsh celebrities joined supporters from around the world praising the team. ""It's amazing what we can achieve when the whole country comes together,"" said Mr Drakeford. ""Commiserations to Ukraine - despite our differences on the field, Wales stands with you."" Wales will share Group B with USA, Iran and England at November's World Cup. Ukraine fans had praised the home supporters for their welcome in Cardiff, while the Welsh FA invited the UK's Ukrainian ambassador to the game in support to the people in the war with Russia. As well as holding banners in solidarity to Ukraine before kick-off, fans enjoyed a rousing rendition of Welsh football anthem Yma o Hyd from folk singer Dafydd Iwan. Skipper Bale said the win is the ""greatest result in history of Welsh football"" and that sentiment was echoed by fan Clive Frances, who hailed an ""amazing"" achievement. ""It's the first time in both of our lifetimes that we've seen Wales qualify for a World Cup final,"" said the 63-year-old from Llanelli, who went to the game with his 14-year-old granddaughter Katie. ""I was born in 1959 so I missed the last time, so this is brilliant,"" he said. ""I've followed Wales all over the world and been to three continents, but this will be my first World Cup, it's tremendous and I've got to go. This means everything to me."" Katie added: ""It's amazing and it's amazing to see my grandad so happy."" The Welsh team has narrowly missed out on qualifying for several World Cups since 1958 and lifelong fan David O'Gorman said that just makes qualifying for the 2022 finals sweeter. ""I've no words to explain how I am feeling and what it means to me and my country,"" said the 47-year-old computer programmer from Cardiff. ""We've had so many heartbreaks so that makes today all the more unbelievable."" Tracey Shanahan headed straight to the match after arriving home from Poland on Sunday afternoon, said the result made her feel proud to be Welsh. ""It makes me proud, very proud,"" said the 56-year-old from Cardiff. ""It's great for the fans, great for the team, great for the country. I'm a bit stuck for words to be honest, it's a bit of an emotional night, it's just fantastic, never-mind the rain it doesn't matter."" Sal Farreed said he never thought he would see the day when Wales would be at a World Cup finals. ""Wales in the World Cup... this is bliss"", said the 50-year-old from Lampeter. ""I never thought I'd ever see this in my lifetime, I never thought this day would come."" Mike and his friend Alex, who have been watching Wales for over 30 years, said they ""had seen many heartaches"", but it made the result ""extra special"". ""It was a bit of a rollercoaster today I'm glad it worked out for us in the end"", said Alex, from Pontyclun, who was with son Owen. ""It's been so many years of not quite qualifying and now finally doing it - we're in the World Cup, so it's amazing."" Owen, 16, was ""absolutely buzzing"" and glad that ""everyone will know how we are now."" Ukrainian refugee and football fan Katerina Gorodnyca said she had ""never had so many hugs"". ""I've been to different stadiums and this was a really special place,"" she said, describing the support from Wales' fans as incredible. ""When our team didn't win, it was the first time another team came to where Ukrainian fans [were sitting] and said thank you, and we said thank you to them for a good match. ""I never had so many hugs after the game because all of the Welsh fans came and hugged us and said ""it's just a game, but we support Ukraine"". ""It was really warm,"" she said. ""When me and my son came here we have felt so much support…it was so pleasant, we really appreciate it. We didn't know a lot about Wales…I discovered this land, these people - and now my love of Wales."" Match of the Day presenter Gary Lineker congratulated the Wales team after Sunday's victory, tweeting: ""It's a shame it had to be at the expense of Ukraine, but it's a wonderful achievement. Well played."" BBC Wales reporter Paul Piggott at the Cardiff City Stadium While the rain pours down on Cardiff some fans are still here celebrating, soaking up the atmosphere - they don't care about the weather! It's been such an emotional moment; some fans were in tears, some were lost for words as they poured out of the stadium singing, celebrating and cheering There's one thing on every Welsh fan's lips: they are overjoyed to say Wales are going to the World Cup and no rain is going to dampen anyone's mood after 64 years waiting.󠁷 The Welsh men's team have not played at football's World Cup finals since 1958 - the longest drought of any team in Europe. Only Cuba and Indonesia - who played at the 1938 finals in France - have gone longer than Wales without qualifying for another. Football's first world superstar Pele was the player to break Welsh hearts in Wales' only previous World Cup appearance in 1958. The then 17-year-old scored the only goal - and his first on the international stage - as eventual tournament winners Brazil beat Wales 1-0 in their quarter final. The Welsh had been close to qualifying on numerous occasions since 1958 - most notably missing out after controversial penalties in 1977 and 1985, both times against Scotland, before Wales themselves squandered a penalty against Romania in 1993. Wales broke the trend by qualifying for football's European Championships in 2016 where the Welsh reached the semi-final - before reaching the last 16 of Euro 2020. "

Russia claims it targeted a site storing tanks and other armoured vehicles supplied by eastern Europe. But Ukraine says the missiles hit a train repair plant where no tanks were held. The last missile strike on the city was in late April, and life there had been getting back to some sort of normality. Heavy fighting continues to rage in Severodonetsk, an industrial city in the Luhansk region of eastern Ukraine. Most of Luhansk is now under Russian occupation, but the Ukrainian army insists it can still push the Russians out of Severodonetsk. Read more here about the latest fighting. President Vladimir Putin said efforts by Western countries to supply Ukraine with long-range missiles would not change anything on the battlefield. In a Russian TV interview, he noted that Ukraine's current multiple-launch rocket systems (MLRS) were similar to Russia's systems. ""There is nothing new here, and it does not change anything in essence,"" he said. The US has pledged to supply Ukraine with Himars - a mobile high-precision MLRS that can hit targets up to 80km (50 miles) away. And the UK plans to send the M270, a bigger US-built system, which may similarly boost Ukrainian forces' firepower. The Russian leader warned, however, against sending longer-range missiles to Ukraine. ""If they are being supplied, we will draw the appropriate conclusions and use our weapons - of which we have enough - to strike targets we haven't yet hit."" Ukraine's top footballers turned up to Cardiff hoping to bring some joy to their war-torn country by qualifying for the World Cup on Sunday - but it wasn't to be. Instead, Wales won the play-off match to secure their place in Qatar - their first World Cup since 1958. The match took place months later than planned, because of the Russian invasion and suspension of domestic football in Ukraine. Ukraine has only made it to the World Cup finals once since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, and has enjoyed plenty of support. Read more about the support for Ukraine here - or about the Welsh victory if you prefer. We've told you before how Kalush Orchestra, the Ukrainian winners of the Eurovision Song Contest, sold their trophy for nearly $1m (£800,000) to fund the war effort in Ukraine.

Wales manager Robert Page said ""most of the world want Ukraine to get through"", in solidarity after Russia's invasion of Ukraine that has killed thousands. Ukrainian refugees in the UK have been offered tickets to the game in Cardiff. Wales hope to put 64 years of World Cup hurt behind them as they bid to qualify for their first finals since 1958. The Football Association of Wales has invited the UK's Ukrainian ambassador to the match, while the Welsh government has given the visiting team and their delegates an official ""warm Welsh welcome"" in support to the people of Ukraine in the war with Russia. Wales' First Minister Mark Drakeford has sent a message of support to the Welsh team, but added this game was an ""opportunity for us to reaffirm our support for Ukraine as it fights Russia's unprovoked and brutal act of war"". Mr Drakeford went on to say: ""It would be fantastic for the squad and the Welsh supporters to have our team competing in the World Cup in November."" Page, Wales' caretaker boss because of full-time manager Ryan Giggs' ongoing absence, has admitted that all the neutral fans will want Ukraine to win. ""They won the Eurovision Song Contest because they had the backing of the world,"" said Page. ""If we could click our fingers and take away the pain the Ukraine are going through, we'd do it in a heartbeat. But when it comes to football and the whistle goes, we'll want to win that game. Business is business. ""We've put ourselves in a good position - 1958 is a long time to wait. Opportunities like this don't come around every day."" Ukraine beat Scotland 3-1 on Wednesday to set-up Sunday's World Cup play-off final with Wales, and their star player Oleksandr Zinchenko has said it will be a ""massive game"" for everyone in his country. ""Everyone knows the situation in Ukraine... and we need to show the performances of our lives,"" said the Manchester City player. ""We dream as a team to be in the World Cup and we have one more game and we need to win it."" Welsh Secretary Simon Hart has also wished an ""extraordinarily talented Wales team"" well, saying qualifying for a first World Cup in 64 years ""would be a truly historic moment for Welsh sport. But he added: ""As much as I want a Wales win, my heart also goes out to the Ukrainian team over the ongoing situation in their country. ""While there can be only one winner on the pitch, the Welsh nation will continue to stand in solidarity with the people of Ukraine."" People in Wales have so far raised millions of pounds for the Ukraine humanitarian fund and, of the 14 million Ukraine people displaced by the conflict, Wales has housed almost 2,000 refugees - with more than 3,300 visas approved. One fan is making the round trip of more than 8,500 miles to be in Cardiff - despite flying over to the UK without a ticket. Rhys Davies travelled with his wife and three young children from Edmonton in Canada in the desperate hope of finding a ticket - and his gamble has paid off. ""I was lucky enough to have good family members to save me a ticket,"" said the 37-year-old electrician, who moved to Canada from Llandovery, in Carmarthenshire, 15 years ago. ""I'm looking forward to it and hoping Wales come through with a victory."" Rhys, whose first Wales game was their memorable win over Italy in 2002 and whose hero is the late captain Gary Speed, normally watches Welsh sporting games in a pub with friends in Alberta. But these World Cup play-offs are different. ""I came over for the play-off semi-final win over Austria in March and that was amazing. I thought to myself there's no way I'm missing the final. ""It's a tough one to call on Sunday, but I'm pretty confident we can do it and get to Qatar."" Tim Hartley, whose first Wales game was their European Championship play-off against Yugoslavia in 1976, hasn't missed a Wales game for 20 years. And although Wales qualified for the Euros in 2016 and 2020 - reaching the semi-finals and last 16 respectively - Tim knows qualifying for the World Cup is the big one. ""The whole world is going to be rooting for Ukraine except for us, so it's going to be difficult,"" said the author from Cardiff. ""It's great to see Ukraine playing football but let's be realistic, we want to get to the World Cup finals."" Wales haven't played at football's World Cup finals for 64 years - the longest drought of any team in Europe. In fact, only Cuba and Indonesia - who played at the 1938 finals in France - have gone longer than Wales without qualifying for another World Cup. Football's first world superstar Pele was the player to break Welsh hearts in Wales' only previous World Cup appearance in 1958. The then 17-year-old scored the only goal - and his first on the international stage - as eventual tournament winners Brazil beat Wales 1-0 in their quarter final. The Welsh have got agonisingly close to qualifying on numerous occasions since 1958 - most notably missing out after controversial penalties in 1977 and 1985, both times against Scotland, before Wales themselves squandered a penalty against Romania in 1993. Wales broke their major finals hoodoo by qualifying for football's European Championships in 2016 where the Welsh reached the semi-final - before reaching the last 16 of Euro 2020. Sunday's play-off kicks off at 17:00 BST and is for a place in the 2022 Fifa World Cup later this year where the winners will share Group B with England and Iran in Qatar. A sell-out Cardiff City Stadium crowd hope to cheer them to a first World Cup finals since 1958 and folk singer Dafydd Iwan will perform Welsh football anthem Yma o Hyd before kick-off. Fans going to the game have been warned not to bring in flares because of what the FAW describes as the ""dangers such as loss of sight, limb or digit removal due to their explosive power"". Football chiefs have warned any fan with a pyrotechnic device risks ""an FA of Wales ban, probable arrest and a minimum three-year football banning order"" - especially after Wales were fined following March's win over Austria. The Welsh FA are also wary of the growing spate of pitch invasions across the UK following significant matches and have warned any supporters entering the field of play ""will be subject to criminal proceedings"" and Wales could face sanctions from Fifa. Supporters have been advised to arrive at the ground early because of ""additional security perimeters"" as the FAW warn it may take fans longer than usual gaining access to the venue. People without tickets have been told by the Football Association of Wales not to travel to the Cardiff City Stadium without a ticket as there is no fan zone or public screening of the game, either outside the ground or in Cardiff city centre. Supporters heading to Cardiff on Sunday have been told car parking is ""limited"" near the ground, so are warned to plan ahead as public transport companies have said services will be ""very busy"". Engineering work will affect train services between Cardiff and Bridgend - meaning the last train to Carmarthen will leave Cardiff Central at 22:00 rather than the usual time of 22:25. Valleys Line services between Pontypridd and Merthyr Tydfil will be shut for engineering work so buses will replace trains. Transport for Wales have reminded football fans travelling to north Wales that the only train after the game is the five-hour 21:07 service to Holyhead, changing at Chester. Roads around the Cardiff City Stadium may be shut two hours before and two hours after the game with Cardiff council warning of closures to Bessemer Road, Sloper Road and Leckwith Road. The length of closures will ""depend on crowds"". Streets in Cardiff city centre will also be shut in the evening as 10,000 people are expected at the Gerry Cinnamon concert in Cardiff Castle - with road closures after and potentially before gig, depending on crowds. Venue: Ahmad Bin Ali Stadium Capacity: 40,000 Games: Seven, up to last 16 Location: Al Rayyan, 20km west of Doha This stadium was built on the site of an old ground with the same name - with more than 80% of the construction materials reused or recycled - including from the initial ground. Its glowing facade is ""comprised of patterns that characterise different aspects of the country"". It will host Al Rayyan Sports Club, with a 20,000 capacity, after the tournament. "

Russia claims it targeted a site storing tanks supplied by Europe, but Ukraine says rockets hit a train repair plant where no tanks were held. Columns of black smoke could be seen above the city after the attack and at least one person was hurt. Kyiv has been largely spared in recent months as Russian forces concentrate attacks on Donbas in eastern Ukraine. The capital has felt like it is returning to some sort of normality; bars and cafes are open and people are back on the streets. But watching columns of black smoke rising over Kyiv in the early hours of Saturday morning, that illusion was shattered. Just a few moments before, Russian cruise missiles had slammed into two sites in the east of the city. Dramatic video on social media showed a number of explosions. The man filming cursed the Russians as he ducked for cover. At the site of one of the strikes, normal life continued. The factory itself was sealed off, but families nearby went about their business, and buses dropped off passengers. One man came and rather angrily demanded we stop filming. Moscow claimed it was targeting a delivery of tanks and armoured vehicles sent in by Ukraine's eastern European allies. Kyiv denied this, saying it was a train repair plant dealing with ""gondola cars and grain trucks"". It comes as Russia's advances into the eastern Donbas region seem to be stalling, with one Ukrainian politician saying the attack on Kyiv was revenge for Moscow's frustrations. Some of the fiercest fighting is currently in the city of Severodonetsk - one of the few parts of Luhansk region not fully under Russian control. Luhansk is one of two regions which makes up the Donbas. Speaking to the BBC, Luhansk regional governor Serhiy Haidai said there was street-fighting in Severodonetsk and that it was still possible for Ukrainian forces to retake it. ""Russians understand that if there is a stable supply of ammunition to Ukrainians, they will not be able to hold the city."" Severodonetsk lies across the river from the city of Lysychansk, which remains under Ukrainian control. Mr Haidai said it held more strategic value. ""Lysychansk is much more important because it is located on the hill. It is easier for the military to defend and strike,"" he said. Ukrainian forces are also hoping that more advanced rocket systems promised by the US will arrive soon, tipping the balance in their favour. But speaking on Russian television on Sunday, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that if the West carried through with its promises of sending the weapons to Ukraine, he would hit ""new targets they had not attacked before"". It wasn't clear what he meant by that, but it would most likely mean more nights for Kyiv like the one it has just endured. "

68,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-south-scotland-61675116,2022-06-05T07:33:42,Scots mechanic to return to Ukraine frontline," A Scottish mechanic who has spent three months fighting with the Ukrainian Army is preparing to return to the front line. In March, just weeks after the Russian invasion, Adam Ennis ignored official warnings and headed to the war zone. He witnessed ""atrocities and devastation"" and now he wants to return with vital equipment to help Ukraine's war effort. The Foreign Office warns against travel to Ukraine to fight. It says that those who do so are putting their lives at risk and they may be prosecuted on their return to the UK. Mr Ennis, who left behind his business, a garage in Biggar, South Lanarkshire, told BBC Scotland that he was regularly in dangerous, life-threatening situations in Ukraine. But he had felt duty-bound to join the war effort, having visited Ukraine and made friends there in the past. ""I just felt I could help,"" he said. ""I pictured myself in their shoes and couldn't imagine anything worse than waking up and somebody is invading your country, destroying your country, killing your friends and family."" Mr Ennis' experience with the International Legion of Territorial Defence of Ukraine (ILDU) began with 10 days' training at Yavoriv military base near the Polish border. His rifle skills, earned in the combined cadet force at Merchiston Castle school in Edinburgh, saw him selected for a unit heading to defend Kyiv from advancing Russian troops. ""A bus left that night to take us to Kyiv,"" Mr Ennis said. ""The next day the base was hit by about 30 missiles. There were 180 dead. Then the bus before us on the way down to Kyiv took contact - and the bus after us, but luckily we didn't."" Ukrainian officials reported that as many as 1,000 foreign fighters had been training at Yavoriv as part of the ILDU. The Russian Ministry of Defence announced it had destroyed ""up to 180 foreign mercenaries and a large consignment of foreign weapons"". It added that Russia would continue attacks on foreign fighters in Ukraine. Mr Ennis's first deployment was in Irpin, just outside Kyiv. Vladimir Putin's forces managed to enter the town but couldn't push through it. If they had, Kyiv would have been their next stop, just 13 miles (21km) down the road. ""We were on the front about 100m away from the Russians,"" said Adam. ""There was a square - we were on the side of the square and they were on the opposite side and it was just artillery firefights. ""We went on day missions and there were times we would spend three or four nights and do recon [reconnaissance]. ""We saw tanks, we were hit directly. I had quite a few close calls. ""We were in the woods, being hit by all sorts - airburst, 120mm artillery rounds. I remember lying face down and shots hitting the ground all around me."" His unit was living in basements and makeshift bases, constantly moving on to avoid becoming a target. Mr Ennis has been home in Biggar for just over a week, to rest. He is spending his time getting prepared to go back, despite the advice of the UK Foreign Office. Its website warns: ""If you travel to Ukraine to fight, or to assist others engaged in the war, your activities may amount to offences under UK legislation and you could be prosecuted on your return to the UK. ""British Nationals fighting in Ukraine have been killed or captured. The risk to life, or of mistreatment by Russian captors, is high, if you choose to travel to Ukraine to fight. Consular support in these circumstances will be very limited."" First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has also said it could be counter-productive for anyone other than trained military personnel to go to the war zone. But Mr Ennis is determined to return, and is raising money to buy a truck which could be used to move casualties from the front line. ""I want to drive a truck over - it is much-needed. I am in the fire team for a group of four medics. We will cover the medics while they go into the front lines and stabilise the injured on the battlefield and once they are stabilised we would put them in the pick-up and get them out of there. ""If I can get one, I will make it roadworthy and a local business will help me armour it and weld it with steel plates. ""I'd also like to get hold of some night vision goggles - we had three pairs between 30 of us. At one point I found myself in the middle of the woods pointing my machine gun into the pitch darkness at 03:00 not knowing what was there. ""Hopefully I can get this equipment and get it back there."" His experiences in Ukraine have only served to increase the respect he feels for the Ukrainian people. ""They are inspirational people, how they have united and stood up to a much bigger enemy,"" he said. ""They are warriors and it is a privilege to be around them. ""I feel like I have been given a purpose out there."" He believes that Ukraine is fighting a war for all of Europe and deserves all the help they can find. He said: ""War is not a nice place. I never thought I would see war in my life. I don't think Russia is going to win, but really, nobody wins in war."" "

""The Russian army is throwing all its power, all its reserves in this direction,"" said Serhiy Haidai, the regional governor. The city has seen extremely fierce fighting in recent days as Russian troops try to take control of the entire Luhansk region - one of two regions which make up the part of eastern Ukraine known as the Donbas. Mr Haidai said earlier that Ukrainian forces had managed to retake some of Severodonetsk from Russian forces, adding that Russia had suffered huge losses. The Russian bombardment of the city has been compared to the battle of Mariupol, which was all but destroyed by a relentless Russian assault. The BBC's Joe Inwood explains why Severodonetsk has both a symbolic and military significance. Elsewhere in the Donbas, fighting sparked a major fire at a famous wooden monastery - the Sviatohirsk Lavra Monastery in the Donetsk region. The Ukrainian Orthodox Church said the flames had engulfed the monastery's main shrine. ""Another crime of Russian barbarians for whom there is nothing sacred,"" Ukrainian army officer, Yurii Kochevenko, said on Facebook. A Ukrainian government tweet shows the fine old monastery intact, before it was hit. Russia blamed Ukrainian ""nationalist"" troops for setting fire to the building. Read more about the monastery fire here. Russia's focus on the Donbas does not mean the shelling has stopped in other parts of the country. To the south, the important Black Sea port city of Mykolaiv was one of the first cities attacked when the invasion began. Russian forces were pushed back from the city limits. But there is still shelling every day there, and if Russia accomplishes its goal of capturing the Donbas it could refocus its efforts to the south and try once again to take Mykolaiv. Despite the constant danger, residents of the region remain defiant. ""Thank God, we are holding on... they [the Russians] should know better than loitering on our land,"" Natalia Panashii told the BBC's Laura Bicker on a recent visit. You can read Laura's report from Mykolaiv here. French President Emmanuel Macron landed himself in hot water with many Ukrainians on Saturday as he attempted to position France as a potential mediator in the war. ""We must not humiliate Russia,"" he told French media, so that ""when the fighting stops we can build an exit ramp through diplomatic means."" Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba quickly responded: ""Calls to avoid humiliation of Russia can only humiliate France and every other country that would call for it. ""It is Russia that humiliates itself."" The war, particularly in the south, has had a devastating effect on Ukraine's ability to export food products from its Black Sea ports. Kyiv and its allies say Moscow has imposed a naval blockade which prevents ships from operating in the region. Ukraine has also mined the coast to prevent a Russian amphibious assault. The resulting shortage of products has driven up the price of staple foods like wheat around the world. That's why the head of the African Union, Macky Sall, has described African countries as innocent victims of the war. More than 40% of wheat consumed in Africa usually comes from Russia and Ukraine. Mr Sall was visiting Russian President Vladimir Putin in the Russian Black Sea resort of Sochi. You can read more here about how the war in Ukraine is making Africa's food crisis worse. "

The community hub in Dereham, Norfolk, offers advice and support for those who have resettled in the area. On Friday it was decked out in bunting and hosted a quiz, bingo, live music and afternoon tea. ""Amongst the sadness we are trying to bring a bit of a distraction and celebrate,"" organiser Leanne Jarman said. She and other volunteers set up the centre in a former clothes shop in Wrights Walk in May, following the huge response to donations for Ukraine. It has a cafe and stocks clothing, food, household essentials, bicycles and toys - all of which are free - and offers English lessons. Ms Jarman said 20 families being hosted in and around Dereham were invited to the celebrations. ""I think they are really happy to be involved with our culture and our British community,"" she added. ""I really think they've enjoyed it."" Asked if they understood it she replied: ""I don't think so - they probably think it's a lot of hype, but we try to make it as celebratory as possible."" Gavin Wolfenden hosts Olga and her sons Gleb, nine, and Bogdan, 12. Her husband - their father - is still in Odessa. He said he had also taken a group of Ukrainian children to other Jubilee celebrations in the town, while their mothers worked. ""The impression I got was they were very happy to take part - just the sheer energy that goes into it, they must enjoy it,"" he said. ""They are taking each day by day, establishing new lives, and many have said in the short term they cannot go back. ""We talk things through, [especially] the pressure of having loved ones still over there."" Speaking through an interpreter, Olga said the Wolfendens had been ""so welcoming"", and she and her sons now felt part of their family. The Jubilee had made them feel part of a ""very big event"", and it was interesting to see British ""traditions"", she added. ""I'm quite worried about my husband, but we are in touch every day,"" she said. Find BBC News: East of England on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

71,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-61687586,2022-06-03T21:51:23,"War in Ukraine: We are holding on, say Mykolaiv residents"," There is shelling every day in Mykolaiv. The Russians are on the outskirts to the east and south, pummelling surrounding villages and forcing thousands to flee. The wail of the air raid siren is a prelude to a thud to our right as our car makes its way through the suburbs of this major port. A plume of smoke a few kilometres away confirms the hit - another rocket. We are following a Ukrainian Red Cross van as they try to rescue some of those coming under regular shelling: yet another busload to add to the already historic human exodus from this country. These farewells have become a familiar sight across Ukraine over the last 100 days, but they are no less heartbreaking to watch. Liudmyla has decided it is time for her youngest children to leave. She can't let them play outside as the bombardment continues and she wants them to be somewhere safe. She holds on to them as long as she can, one under each arm, until it is time to go. Then it is too much. She turns her back and sobs as they leave. ""I will see them again when the bombing stops,"" she tells me. But no-one knows when that will be. Mykolaiv was one of the first cities attacked when the invasion began. Russian forces came close to the city limits but were pushed back. This region is key to Russian's strategy to cut off the entire southern coast. A breakthrough here would allow the Kremlin's forces to approach Odesa - the country's largest civilian port, 130 km (80 miles) to the west. Vladimir Putin could then complete his land bridge up to Transnistria, the breakaway republic of Moldova. Russian attacks have stepped up in recent weeks, prompting fears that if the Kremlin prevails in Donbas, it will then concentrate its forces in the south and try once again to take Mykolaiv. The city governor, Vitaliy Kim, tells me that the recent air attacks in the south have been aimed at Ukrainian counter-offensives. ""Mykoliav, like Kherson, like Mariupol, is a trigger point for the Russians,"" he said. ""They are disappointed that we are counter-attacking. We have the motivation and the will to win. This is our land and we will do our best."" He is standing outside his former office, the regional administration building, which was ripped apart by a cruise missile in March, killing 36 people. Earlier this week, two people were killed when the Russians shelled an apartment block and a playground. Mr Kim is aware of the risks of staying. ""I don't know what it is any more to live a normal life. I wish very much to end the war but I can't. ""For now, we have only one purpose. And everything, every human resource, money, time is spent only for victory."" This city has proved to be remarkably resilient. Water is a precious resource - supplies were cut off after Russia seized the neighbouring city of Kherson. Queues to fill bottles are often long and June temperatures are hitting around 30C. And yet people here have managed to find a way to make it work. They fill up their containers from local stations set up in neighbourhoods. The daily thud of incoming shells barely registers. Most hardly look up from their coffee as they sit on benches in the park. There is even a horse and Cinderella-like carriage with courting couples merrily trundling up and down the High Street. This may be a Kremlin target, but it is also home. We head 30 km (19 miles) south to a village near the frontline to see the path of Russia's retreat in March. Dozens of families have returned since the invading forces were pushed back. The village head, Natalia Panashii, is keen to show me what they've done with the bomb craters. ""Look, I've turned them into flower beds,"" she tells me proudly. ""Thank God, we are holding on. Sometimes I am very scared that they might just kidnap me and take me away. On the other hand, I am sure, and I keep telling this to everyone else, that they have no business here. They should know better than loitering on our land."" ""Yes, we are concerned that the Russians might go on an offensive, very concerned. But we believe that the victory is going to be ours."" We hear what I am told are cluster bombs being launched just a few kilometres away, so I question Natalia's optimism. ""Yes, even with that thumping,"" she said. ""We think that those thuds are just because some drunk Russian is firing to scare us. But he is failing at that."" Natalia has lived for the last 100 days in both defiance and dread. She admits to me that she will sit down and have a cry when I leave. It makes me want to sit with her a little longer, but she waves me off with some Ukrainian biscuits. As I head to the car, I notice the roads surrounding the village are still marked by the tracks of Russian tanks. Natalia points at them and shakes her head. ""No, no, no,"" she says. The Russians have been at her door once. She is determined they will not be back. "

After talks in Sochi, Macky Sall said the Russian leader had promised to ease the export of cereals and fertiliser, but gave no details. Mr Putin denied Moscow was preventing Ukrainian ports from exporting grain. Over 40% of wheat consumed in Africa usually comes from Russia and Ukraine. But Ukraine's ports in the Black Sea have been largely blocked for exports since the conflict began. Kyiv and its allies blame Moscow for blockading the ports, which Ukraine has mined to prevent a Russian amphibious assault. ""Failure to open those ports will result in famine,"" the UN's crisis coordinator Amin Awad said in Geneva. He said a grain shortage could affect 1.4 billion people and trigger mass migration. The war has exacerbated already existing shortages in Africa caused by bad harvests and insecurity. Food prices have shot up across the continent since Russia invaded Ukraine 100 days ago, pushing huge numbers towards hunger. The head of the World Food Programme, Mike Dunford, said more than 80 million people were acutely food insecure, acutely hungry in Africa - up from about 50 million people this time last year. Chad has declared a national food emergency. A third of the population needs food aid, according to the UN and the government has appealed for international assistance. Mr Sall, who is Senegal's president, told Mr Putin he should be ""aware that our countries, even if they are far from the theatre [of action], are victims of this economic crisis"". He said he was also pleading on behalf of other countries in Asia, the Middle East and Latin America. Mr Putin said Russia was ready to guarantee the safe export of Ukrainian grain via ports on the Azov and Black seas it controls. He said the best solution would be to lift sanctions on Belarus, a close Russian ally, so the grain could be shipped that way. Some analysts argue the Kremlin is hoping that a looming food crisis will put political pressure on the West by provoking big new refugee flows towards Europe from food-insecure countries in the Middle East and Africa. Before Friday's meeting, Mr Putin said he was always on the side of Africa, but didn't explicitly mention the continent's food crisis. Like many African countries, Senegal has avoided taking sides in the conflict and the Senegalese leader also said food supplies should be ""outside"" the West's sanctions on Russia. He said he had made this point when he spoke to the European Council earlier in the week. Last Friday, US President Joe Biden dismissed the idea that the West bore responsibility for the global price rises. ""This is a Putin price hike. Putin's war has raised the price of food because Ukraine and Russia are two of the world's major bread baskets for wheat and corn, the basic product for so many foods around the world,"" he said. "

Mr Zelensky was speaking outside the presidential palace in Kyiv, where he was flanked by key advisors, echoing a video message he posted at the onset of the war. He said Ukrainian troops have ""done what seemed impossible"" and stopped ""the second army of the world"". Later, the Ukrainian leader wrote on Telegram that Russia has been ""unable to achieve any strategic goal"" and has instead tried to ""shift its powerlessness to civilian infrastructure and people"". Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov hit back, insisting ""certain results have been achieved"" and claiming the ""liberation"" of some regions from what he called the ""pro-Nazi armed forces of Ukraine"". Several world leaders used the 100-day mark to praise Ukraine's resistance, including EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who said the ""bravery of Ukrainians commands our respect and our admiration"". Kyiv didn't feel like a city bracing itself for on onslaught of 150,000 Russian soldiers in January, the BBC's James Waterhouse reports. . ""It's all a bluff"" and ""we're at war already"" were the most common responses when people were asked whether they were worried about what seemed to be the unthinkable at the time. Of course, within five weeks that all changed. Some in the West predicted Kyiv would fall within 72 hours. Over a period of 100 days the city has gone from stubborn normality, through complete darkness, and is now emerging into some sort of calm. It's still far from what it was before the war, but it's nevertheless a picture of defiance. Some Russian troops are refusing to return to fight in Ukraine because of their experiences on the front line at the start of the invasion, according to Russian human rights lawyers and activists. One soldier spent five weeks fighting in Ukraine earlier this year. He told the BBC he didn't want to return to Ukraine to ""kill and be killed"". He is now home in Russia, having taken legal advice to avoid being sent back to the front line. He is just one of hundreds of Russian soldiers understood to have been seeking such advice. ""I had thought that we were the Russian army, the most super-duper in the world,"" the young man said bitterly. Instead they were expected to operate without even basic equipment, such as night vision devices, he says. Wars ebb and flow and in enormous mechanised conflicts like Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine it can often be difficult to determine who has gained the upper hand. Despite early fears of a Ukrainian collapse, Russia's offensive in much of Ukraine stalled and its forces were pushed back from Kyiv. That has now been met by a more focused Russian offensive in the east. But 100 days on, where might this war go next? The BBC's diplomatic correspondent James Landale presents five potential scenarios - they are not mutually exclusive, but all are within the bounds of plausibility. Since the war in Ukraine began, Russian authorities have clamped down on the country's media. The narrative is set by fiercely pro-war TV stations that have stuck resolutely to the Kremlin's narrative. At the start of the invasion, these stations refused to call Vladimir Putin's invasion a war. Now, the strident talk shows that dominate the schedules say repeatedly that Moscow faces World War Three with the West. Ukraine says the Russian army looted or damaged more than 1,000 computers at the Chernobyl nuclear power station and stole trucks and radiation dosimeters. But Chernobyl's information director Vitaliy Medved said nuclear equipment was not damaged and ""regarding radiation safety everything is OK"". In the exclusion zone, however, there are some radiation hotspots which Chernobyl's managers blame on the Russian military activity, as troops dug trenches and their vehicles churned up dust. Yevhen Kramarenko, head of the exclusion zone agency, said thousands of Russian vehicles including tanks had driven through the zone. He said Russia had based more than 1,000 soldiers at Chernobyl.

The company closed its Moscow office and paused investment in Russia in March, following the invasion of Ukraine. However, its 22 hotels in the country are owned by third parties and remained open. Marriott said the process of suspending operations in Russia was ""complex"". But in a statement, it said: ""We have come to the view that newly announced US, UK and EU restrictions will make it impossible for Marriott to continue to operate or franchise hotels in the Russian market."" The company said it remained ""focused on taking care of our Russian-based associates"" and had been supporting individuals in Ukraine and Russia to secure employment with Marriott outside countries affected by the conflict. ""We continue to join our associates and millions of people around the world in wishing for an end to the current violence and the start of a path towards peace,"" it added. Marriott joins McDonald's, Starbucks and other companies in heading for the exits in recent weeks as the war in Ukraine continues and Western sanctions aimed at isolating Russia economically tighten. Public outcry over Vladimir Putin's invasion also put pressure on Western brands to distance themselves. Hotel brands drew attention for being among the slowest to respond. ""The process to suspend operations in a market where Marriott has operated for 25 years is complex,"" the company said in a statement. Marriott did not provide further details about its exit. French carmaker Renault's assets in the country were nationalised, while burger giant McDonald's sold its restaurants, many of which were directly owned by the company, to an existing franchisee. "

The losses caused by the Russian occupation - now ended - are put at more than 1.6bn hryvnia (£44m; $54m). The explosion of a reactor at Chernobyl spread radiation across Europe in 1986. The decommissioned plant, north of Kyiv, lies near the Belarus border and was quickly occupied by Russian troops after their 24 February invasion. Russian forces controlled the plant for five weeks before withdrawing on 31 March. A team from the UN's International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has just ended a visit to Chernobyl and its surrounding 2,700sq km (1,040sq mile) exclusion zone. An IAEA statement says they ""provided support to their Ukrainian counterparts on radiation protection, safety of waste management and nuclear security"". Ukraine's nuclear inspectorate has confirmed to the BBC that the Chernobyl site's radiation level is currently safe. In the exclusion zone, however, there are some radiation hotspots which Chernobyl's managers blame on the Russian military activity, as troops dug trenches and their vehicles churned up dust. Yevhen Kramarenko, head of the exclusion zone agency, said thousands of Russian vehicles including tanks had driven through the zone. He said Russia had based more than 1,000 soldiers at Chernobyl. In April the agency said the Russians had plundered two labs at Chernobyl, stealing sources of ionising radiation. Mr Medved told the BBC that Russian soldiers had stolen ""computer monitors, hard drives and software"". ""We're still checking the losses... [it's] more than 1,000 units, and whatever they didn't steal they broke."" Some removed spare wheels from their armoured personnel carriers so that they could carry away more looted equipment, he said. Construction and firefighting vehicles were stolen, he said, without giving a figure. The Russian military has also been accused of looting elsewhere in Ukraine, but has not commented on the reports. It denies indiscriminate targeting of civilian areas. Chernobyl acting director-general Valeriy Seyda says the plant's losses amount to more than 1.6bn hryvnia. He says operations have resumed there safely. The staff, with help from the IAEA, have to monitor the dormant reactors closely and run scientific tests. The Russian troops smashed up and looted Chernobyl's workshops, labs and offices, Mr Seyda said. Their negligence of safety rules, he said, ""caused some deterioration in [the] radiation situation"" which, he added, has been mitigated. Ukraine has now de-mined the area and disposed of ammunition left behind, Mr Seyda said. Repairs have begun on the damaged facilities, he said, but it is now urgent to ensure safe operations for radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuel. Mr Medved said staff living in Slavutych, a town near the site, had previously commuted easily by train. ""But now the bridges are blown, there is no direct route, they have to go by bus via Kyiv."" And he said the whereabouts of 196 Ukrainian soldiers taken prisoner by the Russians at Chernobyl were still unknown. Ukraine now has eight reactors connected to the grid - two at the Zaporizhzhia power station, which is under Russian occupation, three at Rivne, two at the South Ukraine power station and one at Khmelnytskyy. Its seven other reactors are shut down for regular maintenance or held in reserve. "

The Football Association of Wales (FAW) and the Welsh government confirmed 100 of those fleeing the war will be given a chance to see the game. It comes as Ukrainians who were living in Wales before the conflict called on the FAW to give tickets to those displaced by Russia's invasion. Home tickets at the Cardiff City Stadium have sold out. The Ukrainian ambassador has also been invited, while a welcome message will be waiting for the Ukrainian team when they arrive at Cardiff Airport. First Minister Mark Drakeford said: ""I would like to give a warm Welsh welcome to the Ukrainian football team and their supporters to Cardiff. ""This will be an opportunity for us to reaffirm our support for Ukraine as it fights Russia's unprovoked and brutal act of war. ""I am sure that the game will be a very competitive fixture between two skilful and passionate teams - there is a big prize to be won."" Ukraine qualified for the play-off final on Wednesday by beating Scotland 3-1 in Glasgow, and now face Wales for a place at the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. Wales are hoping to qualify for the tournament for the first time since 1958, while Ukraine qualified for their first and only World Cup in 2006. "

The move is intended to slow soaring inflation and prevent a further collapse of its currency following Russia's invasion in February. Businesses have been forced to close and key supply chains have been cut off since the war began. The World Bank predicts that Ukraine's economy could shrink by as much as 45% this year. The rate of inflation - or the cost of living - has risen to 17% in Ukraine and is on track to hit 20% this year, according to the country's central bank. The National Bank of Ukraine said the benchmark interest rate increase - from 10% to 25% - would help protect citizens' savings from being eaten by soaring inflation. Ukraine's currency, the hryvnia, has also come under heavy pressure since Russia's invasion, falling sharply in value. The central bank said it hoped the rate rise would ease some of that strain and stabilise the currency. It is Ukraine's first rate increase since the war broke out, with the bank signalling it would move to reduce rates again once inflation was back under control. More than $100bn of infrastructure damage to Ukrainian cities has been caused by artillery fire and airstrikes, according to the Kyiv School of Economics, while 14 million citizens have been forced to flee their homes. To mount its military defence, and support citizens who have lost their livelihoods, the government has rapidly increased its spending, pushing the budget deficit up 27% month on month to $7.7bn in May, according to Kyiv-based investment bank Dragon Capital. Banks have also been forced to accept that loans made to businesses in territory now controlled by Russia will probably never be repaid, another huge financial blow to the country's economy. ""The most likely scenario is that nearly all corporate and retail loans in the territories that are still occupied will be lost,"" said Vitaliy Vavryshchuk, head of macro research at asset manager Investment Capital Ukraine. Friday marks 100 days since Russia invaded neighbouring Ukraine, with 4,500 civilians killed since fighting broke out. Hospitals and schools have been devastated, while ports have been blockaded, cutting Ukraine off from the exports that form the backbone of its economy. Around 50% of the world's supply of neon gas, critical for making the microchips that power smartphones and cars, comes from just two Ukrainian companies. In addition, more than 18% of global barley exports, 16% of corn, and 12% of wheat, come from Ukraine's fields. ""The food crisis really threatens up to 1.4 billion people that are going to experience food shortages and even famine in some places,"" Amin Awad, the UN crisis coordinator for Ukraine told the BBC's Today programme. ""The food is stranded in Ukraine. It produces 85 million tonnes of grain every year."" With another large harvest coming up in July and August this year, Mr Awad warned that if grain silos - currently full with food - can't be cleared, crops would rot in the fields because there would be no place to store them. Egypt, which prior to the war received around 80% of its wheat from Russia and Ukraine, is currently experiencing shortages, and warned that ""millions"" could die globally. Meanwhile, in Turkey inflation surged to a 24-year high of 73.5% in the year to May, driven by the war in Ukraine, a weak currency and high energy prices. Food costs have skyrocketed by 92% over the past year in Turkey, making basic goods unaffordable for many despite government interventions. "

On the war's 100th day, the UK said Russia holds 90% of the Luhansk region - half of the Donbas - and is likely to complete control of it in two weeks. It said these tactical successes had been achieved ""at significant resource cost"" with the concentration of forces. But it said none of Russia's original war objectives had been achieved. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky has warned that Moscow's forces are now in control of 20% of Ukrainian territory, with a front line that extends for more than 1,000 km (621 miles). On Thursday, Nato Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said Western nations must be prepared to support Ukraine over the long haul, as the conflict becomes a ""war of attrition"". In its most recent count of civilian casualties on 2 June, the UN said it had recorded 4,169 deaths and 4,982 injuries - including 67 deaths of children. But it said the true total was likely to be considerably higher as it has not yet been able to confirm deaths in some regions where the fighting is intense - such as Mariupol in southern Ukraine, where officials estimate 21,000 civilians have been killed. Assessing the 100-day conflict so far, the UK's Defence Intelligence, part of the Ministry of Defence, said Moscow had failed in its initial objectives of seizing Ukraine's centres of government and the capital, Kyiv. ""Staunch Ukrainian resistance"" and the failure to secure Hostomel airfield near the capital during the first 24 hours led to the Russian assault being pushed back, the intelligence update said. It also said Russian forces suffered from ""false planning assumptions"" and ""poor tactical execution"". But since it changed its strategy to focus on the Donbas, the region in south-eastern Ukraine where Russian-backed separatist groups have been fighting for eight years, Moscow has begun ""achieving tactical success"", the UK said. ""Russian forces have generated and maintained momentum and currently appear to hold the initiative over Ukrainian opposition,"" the intelligence update said. ""Russia controls over 90% of Luhansk Oblast and is likely to complete control in the next two weeks."" The UK intelligence assessment said Russia had not been able to ""generate momentum or movement"" on other fronts and is on the defensive in other parts of the conflict. Achieving ""any form of success"" in the war will require ""continued huge investment of manpower and equipment"" and is likely to take a considerable amount of time, the assessment concluded. "
80,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-61671917,2022-06-03T04:41:37,"The war in Kyiv: Denial, darkness and then calm"," Kyiv didn't feel like a city bracing itself for 150,000 Russian soldiers to cross the border into Ukraine. Arriving in Kyiv in January I decided to brave the supermarket near my flat. You could get your hands on just about any kind of meat or vegetable it seemed, even a pint of beer on aisle six. ""It's all a bluff"", ""we're at war already"", were the most common responses when I asked people whether they were worried about what seemed to be the unthinkable at the time. Of course, within five weeks that all changed. Some in the West predicted Kyiv would fall within 72 hours. Over a period of 100 days the city has gone from stubborn normality, through complete darkness, and is now emerging into some sort of calm. It's still far from what it was before the war, but it's nevertheless a picture of defiance. ""You'd better get your stuff together,"" was the short phone call I received at 04:50 on 24 February. I headed to the roof of our building. There were regular thuds from air strikes. Low-flying jets occasionally flew overhead, and black plumes of smoke appeared on the horizon. Then, not for the last time, the howl of the siren. The shadow of war had descended on this ancient city, and it felt almost immediate. Highways out of Kyiv were blocked by thousands of cars trying to get away from the Russian advance. People queued at ATMs, as well as recruitment offices for Ukraine's territorial defence. They would show ID and be issued with the now familiar yellow armband and an automatic weapon. Just before midday, President Volodymyr Zelensky tweeted that anyone prepared to defend Ukraine would be armed. These extraordinary words from a world leader matched the immediate threat his country faced. From our bomb shelter, people watched on the social media platform, Telegram, as Russian paratroopers tried to take the Hostomel air base to the north-west of Kyiv. There was fierce fighting, and it was in this area where the new frontline formed. The following weeks would see the Russians resort to longer-range missile strikes on central locations in the city. Kyiv's air defence systems often worked, but residential buildings were regularly hit. More than half the city's four million population would leave. Across the country almost 15 million Ukrainians would be displaced, according to the United Nations. The common theme with each impact was the scale of the devastation. In March a deadly strike left parts of the Retroville shopping mall in the north-east of the city flattened. Cladding was blown off neighbouring blocks. Thousands of people were trapped in the fighting in surrounding towns like Irpin and Bucha. Temporary ceasefires allowed some to escape to Kyiv train station, where the majority would travel west towards cities like Lviv. Many took their chances under heavy shelling. In April, the tide turned. The Russian retreat allowed Kyiv to claw back some of the reality it had lost. There were no more military checkpoints in central parts of the city. Expressions of anger and fear were replaced with occasional smiles. Menus in cafes and restaurants were offering a greater choice. As the sun beamed overhead, it was like looking at Kyiv through a different filter. Despite fears at the time, the city didn't find itself under siege like Mariupol and Severodonetsk. Clear roads to the south kept blood pumping into it, keeping Kyiv alive. Reprieve for the capital, however, exposed overwhelming evidence of war crimes. In residential towns like Borodyanka not one building had been left undamaged. Police found hundreds of soldiers and civilians in shallow graves and continue to do so. The Kremlin has always denied committing war crimes and described this evidence as ""fake"". However, there is nothing artificial about the devastation that surrounds Kyiv. The past few weeks has seen the city feel as normal as it has ever been. The nights are still silent with a 23:00 curfew, but the day brings more life. Museums are open once more. Angry traffic jams are a thing again. Officials believe the city is back to two-thirds of its original population. It certainly feels like it with busier parks, fuller theatres and subways being used to get the train once again. Despite the uncertainty remaining over whether the Russians will make another attempt on Ukraine's capital, the city seems determined to heal. What the next 100 days will bring is far from clear, and Ukrainians know it. Restoring normality is just as much a coping mechanism for people, as it is essential. "

82,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-61607184,2022-06-02T23:06:42,The Russian soldiers refusing to fight in Ukraine," Some Russian troops are refusing to return to fight in Ukraine because of their experiences on the front line at the start of the invasion, according to Russian human rights lawyers and activists. The BBC has been speaking to one such soldier. ""I don't want to go [back to Ukraine] to kill and be killed,"" says Sergey - not his real name - who spent five weeks fighting in Ukraine earlier this year. He is now home in Russia, having taken legal advice to avoid being sent back to the front line. Sergey is just one of hundreds of Russian soldiers understood to have been seeking such advice. Sergey says he is traumatised by his experience in Ukraine. ""I had thought that we were the Russian army, the most super-duper in the world,"" says the young man bitterly. Instead they were expected to operate without even basic equipment, such as night vision devices, he says. ""We were like blind kittens. I'm shocked by our army. It wouldn't cost much to equip us. Why wasn't it done?"" Sergey joined the army as a conscript - most Russian men between the ages of 18-27 must complete one year of compulsory military service. But, after a few months, he made the decision to sign a two-year professional contract which would also give him a salary. In January, Sergey was sent near the border with Ukraine for what he was told would be military drills. A month later - 24 February, the day Russia launched its invasion - he was told to cross the border. Almost immediately his unit found itself under attack. As they stopped for the evening in an abandoned farm, their commander said: ""Well, as you will have worked out by now, this is not a joke."" Sergey says he was completely shocked. ""My first thoughts were 'Is this really happening to me?'"" They were continually shelled, he says, both when moving and when parked overnight. In his unit of 50 people, 10 were killed and 10 others wounded. Almost all his comrades were under the age of 25. He heard of Russian servicemen so inexperienced that they ""did not know how to shoot and couldn't tell one end of a mortar from another"". He says his convoy - travelling through northern Ukraine - broke up after just four days when a bridge they were about to cross exploded, killing comrades ahead of them. In another incident, Sergey says he had to overtake comrades trapped inside a burning vehicle in front of him. ""It was blown up from a grenade launcher or something else. It caught fire and there were [Russian] soldiers inside. We drove around it and on, firing as we went. I didn't look back."" His unit moved on through the Ukrainian countryside, but there was a clear lack of strategy, he says. Reinforcements failed to arrive and soldiers were poorly equipped for the task of taking a large city. ""We went without helicopters - just in a column, as though we were heading to a parade."" He believes his commanders had planned to capture strongholds and key cities very quickly - and had calculated that the Ukrainians would simply surrender. ""We rushed forward with short overnight stays, without trenches, without reconnaissance. We didn't leave anyone in the rear, so if someone decided to come in from behind and hit us there was no protection. ""I think that [so many of] our guys died largely because of this. If we had moved gradually, if we had checked the roads for mines many losses could have been avoided."" Sergey's complaints about lack of equipment have also emerged in phone conversations alleged to be between Russian soldiers and their families, intercepted and posted online by the Ukrainian security services. At the beginning of April, Sergey was sent back over the border to a camp on the Russian side. Troops had been withdrawn from northern Ukraine and appeared to be regrouping for an assault in the east. Later that month he received an order to return to Ukraine - but told his commander that he was not prepared to go. ""He said it was my choice. They didn't even [try to] dissuade us, because we weren't the first,"" Sergey told the BBC. But, he had been sufficiently worried about his unit's reaction to his refusal that he decided to seek legal advice. A lawyer told Sergey and two like-minded colleagues to return their arms and go back to their unit's headquarters - where they should file a letter explaining that they were ""morally and psychologically exhausted"" and could not continue fighting in Ukraine. Sergey was told that returning to the unit was important because simply leaving could be interpreted as desertion, which can result in a two-year sentence in a disciplinary battalion. Army commanders try to intimidate contract soldiers into staying with their units, according to Russian human rights lawyer Alexei Tabalov. But he stresses that Russian military law does include clauses which allow soldiers to refuse to fight if they don't want to. Human rights activist Sergei Krivenko says he is not aware of any prosecutions of those refusing to return to the front. That is not to say that prosecutions are not being attempted. One commander in northern Russia requested a criminal case be brought against his subordinate who would not return to Ukraine, but a military prosecutor refused to proceed, according to documents seen by the BBC. Such an action would be ""premature"" without having assessed the harm to the military service he was involved in, the prosecutor said. And there is no guarantee that more prosecutions might not emerge in the future. Soldiers like Sergey - reluctant to return to the front line - are not unusual, according to Ruslan Leviev, the editor of Conflict Intelligence Team, a media project investigating the experiences of the Russian military in Ukraine through confidential interviews and open source material. Leviev says his team estimates a sizeable minority of the Russian contract soldiers sent to Ukraine to fight in the initial invasion refused to go back again. Independent Russian media have also been reporting hundreds of cases of soldiers refusing repeat deployments to Ukraine since the beginning of April. Several lawyers and human rights activists the BBC spoke to said they had been regularly offering advice to men trying to avoid returning to Ukraine. Each of our interviewees had dealt with dozens of cases and believed those soldiers were also sharing advice with their colleagues. Although Sergey does not want to return to the front line, he does want to complete his outstanding military service in Russia to avoid any unforeseen consequences. But that means that - while his letter of refusal to fight was accepted - there are no guarantees he won't be sent back to Ukraine during his service period. ""I can see that the war continues, it is not going away,"" he told the BBC. ""In these months [of compulsory military service] that I have left, anything - including the worst - could happen."" © 2022 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.

83,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-61674469,2022-06-02T23:05:53,Ukraine war: Five ways Russia's invasion may play out," Wars ebb and flow. Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine is no exception. Early fears of a swift conquest were succeeded by Russian retreat and Ukrainian resistance. That has now been met by a more focused Russian offensive in the east. But 100 days on, where might this war go next? Here are five potential scenarios - they are not mutually exclusive, but all are within the bounds of plausibility. The war might continue for months - if not years - as Russian and Ukrainian forces grind each other down. Momentum shifts to and fro as both sides make gains and losses. Neither side is willing to give up. Russia's President Putin judges he can gain by demonstrating strategic patience, gambling that Western countries will suffer from ""Ukraine fatigue"" and focus more on their economic crises and the threat from China. The West, however, shows resolve and continues to supply Ukraine with weapons. Semi-permanent front lines are established. Steadily the war becomes a frozen conflict, a ""forever war"". Mick Ryan, a retired Australian general and military scholar, says: ""There is little prospect of a crushing operational or strategic victory by either side in the short term. Neither belligerent has demonstrated the capacity to land a strategically decisive blow."" What if President Putin were to surprise the world with a unilateral ceasefire? He could pocket his territorial gains and declare ""victory"". He could claim his ""military operation"" was complete: Russian-backed separatists in Donbas protected; a land corridor to Crimea established. He could then seek the moral high ground, putting pressure on Ukraine to stop fighting. ""This is a ploy which could be used by Russia at any time, if it wants to capitalise on European pressure on Ukraine to surrender and give up territory in exchange for notional peace,"" says Keir Giles, Russia expert at the Chatham House think tank. The arguments are heard already in Paris, Berlin and Rome: no need to prolong the war, time to end the global economic pain, let's push for a ceasefire. This, though, would be opposed by the US, the UK and much of eastern Europe, where policymakers believe Russia's invasion must fail, for the sake of Ukraine and the international order. So a unilateral Russian ceasefire might change the narrative but not end the fighting. What if both Ukraine and Russia conclude they cannot achieve more militarily and enter talks for a political settlement? Their armies are exhausted, running short of manpower and munitions. The price in blood and treasure no longer justifies further fighting. Russia's military and economic losses are not sustainable. The Ukrainian people tire of war, unwilling to risk more lives for an eternally elusive victory. What if the leadership in Kyiv - no longer trusting continued Western support - decide the time has come to talk? US President Joe Biden openly admits America's aim is for Ukraine to be ""in the strongest possible position at the negotiating table"". But there may not be a battlefield stalemate for many months and any political settlement would be hard, not least because of Ukraine's lack of trust in Russia. A peace deal might not endure and could be followed by more fighting. Could Ukraine - against the odds - achieve something close to a victory? Could Ukraine force Russian troops to withdraw to where they were before the invasion? ""Ukraine will definitely win this war,"" the country's President Volodymyr Zelensky told Dutch TV this week. What if Russia fails to seize all Donbas and suffers more losses? Western sanctions hit Russia's war machine. Ukraine makes counter attacks, using its new long-range rockets, seizing back territory where Russian supply lines are stretched. Ukraine transforms its army from a defensive to an offensive force. This scenario is plausible enough for policymakers to worry already about its consequences. If Mr Putin were facing defeat, might he escalate, potentially using either chemical or nuclear weapons? The historian Niall Ferguson told a seminar at Kings College, London recently: ""It seems unlikely to me that Putin is going to accept conventional military defeat when he has a nuclear option."" And what of a possible Russian ""victory""? Western officials emphasise that Russia, despite early setbacks, still plans to seize the capital Kyiv and subjugate much of Ukraine. ""Those maximalist objectives remain in place,"" one official said. Russia could capitalise on its gains in Donbas, freeing up forces for use elsewhere, perhaps even targeting Kyiv once again. The sheer weight of Russian numbers come to bear. Ukrainian forces continue to suffer. President Zelensky already admits up to 100 Ukrainian soldiers are dying and another 500 are wounded every day. The people of Ukraine could divide, some wanting to fight on, others wanting to sue for peace. Some Western countries might tire of supporting Ukraine. But equally, if they thought Russia was winning, others might want to escalate. One Western diplomat told me privately the West should test a nuclear weapon in the Pacific as a warning to Russia. The future of this war is not yet written. "

Addressing lawmakers in Luxembourg, he added that the front line extended for more than 1,000km (621 miles). ""All combat-ready Russian military formations are involved in this aggression,"" he told MPs via videolink. Russian forces have been intensifying attacks on the city of Severodonetsk in the eastern Donbas region. UK defence officials say Russia has seized most of the city and are making ""steady local gains, enabled by a heavy concentration of artillery"". Severodonetsk is the easternmost city under Ukrainian control and regional governor Serhiy Haidai said Russia was trying to break through defences in the city ""from all directions"". However he said Ukrainian troops were carrying out counter-attacks, ""pushing back the enemy on some streets and taking several prisoners"". Intense street-to-street fighting in the city had hampered evacuations, he said, describing such efforts as ""extremely dangerous"". In a video address late on Thursday evening, Mr Zelensky said the situation in Donbas had not changed significantly that day but that Ukrainians had experienced ""some success"" in battles in Severodonetsk. Some 15,000 civilians remain trapped in the city, with many of them taking shelter at the massive Azot chemical plant. On Wednesday, Mr Zelensky accused Russia of ""madness"" after its troops allegedly targeted the site during an artillery barrage. Further south, the mayor of the occupied city of Mariupol has accused Russian forces of executing civil servants who have refused to collaborate with the new Moscow-backed city authority. Vadym Boychenko, who was evacuated from Mariupol before it fell, said dozens of residents were being held at the Olenivka Prison and that he had received reports of locals being tortured by occupying forces. The BBC cannot verify these allegations. Last week an adviser to Mr Boychenko told CNN that at least 22,000 people had been killed during Russia's siege and bombardment of the city. In the north-east, Russian shelling killed a woman and injured a man in Kharkiv, regional officials said. And in western Ukraine five civilians were hurt in missile strikes on Lviv, regional head Maksym Kozytskyi said. Western leaders are also stepping up sanctions against key allies of Russian President Vladimir Putin. US Treasury Department officials unveiled a new raft of sanctions on Thursday, with targets including several yachts allegedly linked to Mr Putin and a cellist who allegedly acts as a middleman for the Russian leader. US officials will seek to seize two vessels, the Russian-flagged Graceful and the Cayman islands-flagged Olympia, which were identified as personal assets of Mr Putin. The cellist, Sergei Roldugin, is allegedly a custodian of the Russian president's offshore wealth. Five oligarchs with links to Mr Putin as well as Russian foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova will also have any US assets frozen and are barred from doing business with US-based corporations. EU diplomats are said to have finalised a sixth package of sanctions against Moscow. The sanctions, which include a limited ban on Russian oil imports, were reportedly agreed after officials accepted a Hungarian request to remove the Russian Orthodox Church, Patriarch Kirill, from the list of targets. The president of the European Parliament also announced a ban on Russian lobbyists entering the chamber's campus. Roberta Metsola wrote on Twitter that she was keen to deprive Moscow's representatives of the ability ""to spread their propaganda & false, toxic narratives about the invasion of Ukraine"". On Wednesday President Joe Biden announced that the US would supply Ukraine with new long-range missiles capable of hitting targets at distances of up to 70km (45 miles). Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov accused the US and its allies of intentionally prolonging the war and of ""adding fuel to the fire"" with the deliveries. "

The last major centre held by Ukraine in the Donbas region is under attack from ""from all directions"", Luhansk Governor Serhiy Haidai said, adding that intense street-to-street fighting in the city had hampered evacuations. Some 15,000 civilians reportedly remain trapped there. UK defence officials say Russia has seized most of Severodonetsk and are making ""steady local gains, enabled by a heavy concentration of artillery"". But Mr Haidai insisted that Ukrainian troops had been carrying out counter-attacks, ""pushing back the enemy on some streets and taking several prisoners"". With Russian forces making slow, grinding progress in the eastern Donbas region and military experts speaking of a long war of attrition, have cracks started to appear in the West's support for Ukraine? In one corner, governments in the UK, Poland and the Baltic states have been consistent in calling for Russia's unambiguous defeat. But in the other corner, Russian President Vladimir Putin sees leaders in France, Germany and Italy calling for a different approach. Of course, it's the US president who really matters to the Kremlin. But Joe Biden has given different signals at different times. Calling Mr Putin a ""war criminal"" back in March and seeming to hint at the need for a change in leadership in Moscow, he was also reluctant this week to send Ukraine rocket systems ""that can strike into Russia"". Russian-imposed authorities in the occupied Zaporizhzhia region have said the Ukrainian state's property and resources in the area will be ""nationalised"". Andrei Trofimov, deputy head of the Moscow-imposed administration, said a decree had been signed for the nationalisation of Ukrainian property, according to Russia's Interfax news agency. Mr Trofimov said the nationalisation would affect land, natural resources and facilities in strategic sectors of the economy, as well as property owned by Ukraine as of 24 February - the day Russia launched its invasion of the country. ""The decree was signed in order to meet state needs related to improving the overall efficiency and social orientation of the economy, as well as to preserve the national heritage for residents of the Zaporizhzhia Region,"" he said.

The Football Association of Wales (FAW) and the Welsh government are in discussions on how many will be made available for Sunday's game. Home tickets at the 33,000-capacity Cardiff City Stadium have sold out. The FAW has also invited the Ukrainian ambassador to the game, and a welcome message will be waiting for the visiting team at Cardiff Airport. The Welsh government is believed to be helping the FAW identify refugees who have fled the conflict in Ukraine. Ukraine qualified for the play-off final on Wednesday by beating Scotland 3-1. Now they will play Wales, with the winners earning a place at the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. Wales are hoping to qualify for the tournament for the first time since 1958, while Ukraine qualified for their first and only World Cup in 2006. The Ukrainian FA has been allocated 5% of matchday tickets, with those expected to go on sale in the coming days. It's thought a small number of tickets for refugees will be made available in addition to the standard visiting allocation. Ukrainians Svitlana Phillips and Maryna Farrell, who were living in Wales before the conflict began, had called on the FAW to give those fleeing the war with Russia the chance to see the game. Ms Phillips, a Ukrainian who has lived in Swansea for 20 years and is married a Welshman, said it would be a ""fantastic"" thing to do. She said: ""For the last few years, people in Wales have shown such generosity to the people of Ukraine. ""So I wouldn't be surprised if it comes to that, and there would be some tickets given away and Ukrainians can come and join and celebrate and have a cheerful day."" Ms Farrell, originally from Lutsk, moved to Wales 14 years ago. She was visiting family in Ukraine when the Russians invaded ""I've had probably about seven phone calls this morning trying to figure out ways of getting to the match,"" she said. ""I know that Cardiff City and the FAW have been very supportive in the past, so I'm really hoping there's something that can be done. ""There is a lot of people who have already come to Wales who would absolutely love to be part of the game on Sunday. I know it will be a very emotional time for them, but it will be an unforgettable moment. ""It would be a great distraction for everyone."" She has lived in Wales for 14 years, but will be supporting Ukraine. ""Having lived in Wales for so long I do consider myself Ukrainian-Welsh; however my roots are still in Ukraine,"" she said. Ms Phillips said she and her husband were going to have to fight to decide whether a Ukrainian or Welsh flag would be erected. She said: ""I am sure that Ukrainian people will be singing the Welsh anthem, and Welsh people will be singing the Ukrainian anthem, in support of recent events and in celebration of togetherness of what we have been through. ""Welsh people in the last three months have shown absolutely incredible generosity supporting Ukraine. ""So obviously it is very important for everybody around the world, what is going on in Ukraine, but at such an event like a football game I think it is going to bring people together, unite even more."" Meanwhile, Welsh fans in Poland have raised money for Ukrainian refugees who became stuck there after Russia's invasion. Wales lost 2-1 in Wroclaw on Wednesday in the Nations League. Twenty young Ukrainian footballers went there for a football tournament in February, but were never able to go home. The visiting supporters raised about 5,000 zloty (£930) to help support the refugees. The Notice Me foundation, a charity which usually works with children with cancer, has been looking after the young footballers. Speaking to BBC Radio Wales, fan Tim Hartley, who went to the match, said: ""This is just our little thank you to the people of Poland, a little something for the children of Ukraine. ""To say we really do support you, it was great to see everybody, we raffled a shirt, we had a sing-song, we raised money. It was great to see the Welsh fans supporting the charity."" The children are slowly being joined by their mothers and their siblings, and the charity has been building a shelter for 200 children and women who are escaping the war. It is hoped the ""Ukrainian House"" will help the children forget about the war, and will make them feel at home in Poland. The charity has been building bathrooms and kitchens, bedrooms and lounges. There will also be classrooms and a kindergarten for the younger children. Jacky Devis from the British Embassy in Warsaw said: ""I am delighted to see that Gôl Cymru chose to donate the funds collected by the fans to Fundacja Zobaczmnie, this money will go towards vital work supporting children.""

Lina Udodenko is from Severodonetsk, in Donbas, which has been attacked by Russian forces. After sleeping in bomb shelters for three weeks, she drove hundreds of miles to flee - but she has been unable to contact her father for two weeks. She said: ""I have no idea how he is. We read every day how more people have died and we just hope it is not him."" ""All these three months - I feel like I have cried every day,"" she added. The 26-year-old said she found out this week that her home had been destroyed after seeing a video on Facebook of her city. ""I recognised my house - it had exploded. Nothing is saved there,"" she said. Talking about seeing the video, she said: ""It's really shocking. All the time you understand that it can happen... but you still believe your house will be safe. All my stuff is still there, my car is still there. ""You still can't believe it - you still want to return."" Ms Udodenko said her 91-year-old grandfather was sitting on the sofa when a bomb exploded near to his apartment. ""It just one day exploded, all the windows in his apartment and I think that is why he had a stroke,"" she said. Ms Udodenko said he was now in Germany with her mother and grandmother. Ms Udodenko, who used to have a job supporting refugees, is being hosted in Nottingham through the Ukrainian Sponsorship Scheme (Homes for Ukraine). She said since arriving just over a week ago, she has already been to a wedding that her host was attending. She added: ""A lot of people said they can bring me cake the next day, or they will help me or show me this cafe in the city's nice. ""Everyone added me on Facebook and now I have a lot of friends here."" Ms Udodenko, who moved to the UK because she hopes her English will help her find work, added: ""It's really nice here but for me it's not my home, and it's hard to imagine how now we can return there.""

88,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-61664991,2022-06-02T07:51:08,Ukraine war: How long can the Western consensus hold?," With Russian forces making slow, grinding progress in the eastern Donbas region and military experts speaking of a long war of attrition, have cracks started to appear in the West's support for Ukraine? As he directs the fighting from the gleaming white halls of the Kremlin, what does Vladimir Putin make of the swirling Western debates over how best to support Ukraine, and the extent to which Russia should be punished? In one corner, he sees governments in Britain, Poland and the Baltics calling for his unambiguous defeat. ""We need to make sure that Russia is driven out of Ukraine by the Ukrainians,"" the Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said last week. ""There can't be any compromising over Ukrainian territory."" But in the other corner, Mr Putin sees leaders in France, Germany and Italy calling for a different approach. Speaking in early May, France's President, Emmanuel Macron, called for a ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine and urged the West not to ""give in to the temptation of humiliation, nor the spirit of revenge"". The following day, Italy's Prime Minister, Mario Draghi, speaking at the White House, said people in Europe wanted ""to think about the possibility of bringing a ceasefire and starting again some credible negotiations"". After Mr Macron and the German Chancellor Olaf Scholz held an 80-minute phone call with Mr Putin on Saturday, aimed at exploring ways to enable Ukraine to export grain through the Black Sea, Latvia's deputy prime minister lashed out on social media. ""It seems that there are a number of so-called Western leaders who possess the explicit need for self-humiliation, in combination with a total detachment from political reality,"" Artis Pabriks tweeted. Of course, it's the US president who really matters to the Kremlin. But Joe Biden has given different signals at different times. Calling Putin a ""war criminal"" back in March and seeming to hint at the need for regime change in Moscow, but also reluctant this week to send Ukraine rocket systems ""that can strike into Russia"". The former Prime Minister and President Dmitry Medvedev called that statement ""rational."" But the US decision announced on Wednesday to send a more advanced rocket system to Ukraine was described by the Kremlin as ""adding fuel to the fire"". With the US president prone to speak off the cuff, it generally falls to his Secretary of State, Anthony Blinken, to deliver the administration's considered position. At a recent Nato foreign ministers' meeting in Berlin, Mr Blinken said the US and its partners were ""focussed on giving Ukraine as strong a hand as possible on the battlefield, and at any negotiating table, so that it can repel Russian aggression and fully defend its independence and sovereignty"". Strong words, but how exactly do you define ""as strong a hand as possible""? And what does ""fully"" defending Ukraine's independence and sovereignty actually mean? So are cracks beginning to break up the veneer of Western consensus on Ukraine? ""You only have to look at the struggle to get the oil embargo,"" says Ian Bond, director of foreign policy at the Centre for European Reform, referring to the tortured weeks of negotiation that resulted in this week's partial EU embargo on Russian oil. Any notion that the EU will move swiftly on to Russian gas has already been dispelled. The Baltic states and Poland would like this to happen quickly, but Estonia's prime minister, Kaja Kallas, admitted this week that ""all the next sanctions will be more difficult"". Austria's chancellor, Karl Nehammer, said a gas embargo ""will not be an issue in the next sanctions package"". The West has promised much, Kyiv argues, but delivered less. This week's American and German promises to supply advanced multiple rocket artillery and air defence and radar systems will certainly have gone some way towards meeting the urgent demands of hard-pressed Ukrainian commanders. But allegations of German foot-dragging over previous commitments and Joe Biden's insistence that US weapons only be used to hit Russian targets inside Ukraine cause some to wonder why the West seeks to place limits on Ukraine's war effort while Russia observes no limits at all. ""There's a kind of calibration going on,"" says Ian Bond. ""As though we're saying 'we want the Ukrainians to win but not to win too much'"". It's widely believed that Mr Putin launched this war confident that the West would lack the stomach for a fight. That Nato members, fresh from their humiliating exit from Afghanistan, would shy away from a new international imbroglio. Some recent reports from Moscow suggest a creeping confidence, engendered by gradual battlefield success and the belief, in the words of one source quoted by the Meduza website, that ""sooner or later, Europe will tire of helping."" The Kremlin may have taken heart from this week's British government warning that as many as six million British households could face power cuts if Russia shuts off gas supplies this winter. Could public anger in the West undermine support for Ukraine? It's a danger the US Director of National Intelligence, Avril Haines, spelled out to members of Congress last month. ""He [Putin] is probably counting on US and EU resolve to weaken,"" she told members of the Senate Armed Services Committee, ""as food shortages, inflation and energy prices get worse."" For all the anxieties about self-inflicted wounds and the hesitation surrounding the supply of weapons, the Western consensus over Ukraine remains remarkably intact. But the cracks that exist could still widen. ""If either side begins to make decisive gains, then they become more of a problem,"" says Ian Bond. ""If the Russians completely break through Ukrainian lines in the east and start heading for the Dnieper River, the question of how much territory Ukraine should be willing to sacrifice to achieve a ceasefire is going to move up the agenda."" By the same token, if Ukrainian forces start driving the Russians back, Ian Bond says, ""there will be voices in the West saying 'don't try and recapture parts of the Donbas that the Russians have controlled since 2014'."" It's not a debate that seems terribly relevant just yet, but when the veteran US diplomat Henry Kissinger suggested at Davos that Ukraine should consider ceding territory in order to make peace with Russia, he met with a furious response in Ukraine and beyond. A sign of anguished debates that still lie ahead. "
89,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-60066015,2022-06-01T23:02:38,Why the Ukraine war may power Asia's green energy shift," For years there have been calls for Asia - which is home to some of the world's biggest CO2 emitters - to ditch fossil fuels to help tackle climate change. Countries in the region - including its three biggest economies China, Japan and India - were criticised last year for not making a bigger commitment at the COP26 global climate change conference. But six months on, there is another, arguably more immediate reason for Asia to make the transition away from oil, gas and coal: money. Global energy prices have jumped since late February when Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine. It has pushed European countries to find ways to rely less on Russian gas with Germany hoping hydrogen could be its answer. Japan and South Korea had also invested heavily in hydrogen technology before the Ukraine war and the soaring cost of energy has provided an additional incentive to accelerate their transition to greener fuels. However, Asian economies have continued to burn coal to produce electricity despite how much it pollutes the environment. While some countries have made progress in moving away from fossil fuels, in emergencies - like when two of the region's economic giants China and India were hit by power shortages - it was coal that they turned to. Japan had invested in nuclear power for decades but after the 2011 Fukushima nuclear accident, it too went back to fossil fuels. Some experts believe hydrogen can help countries make the transition from fossil fuels to renewables and that is what a growing number of South Korean businesses are now betting on. The country has so far announced the largest government spending in Asia on the development of hydrogen technology. Seoul is pushing investments into the production of hydrogen as well as technology for fuel cell power generation and hydrogen-powered cars. Hydrogen is also considered by some experts to be the most practical alternative to fossil fuels as it can be stored as a solid, liquid or gas. That means, in comparison to solar and wind, it can be more easily stockpiled and transported. ""Hydrogen is like an energy carrier,"" says Vince Heo of S&P Global Commodity Insights in Seoul. ""You can store energy in the hydrogen and you can use them whenever you want."" A key issue is that there are different types of hydrogen and what South Korea is currently investing in is not emission-free. The goal is to eventually transition to so-called ""green hydrogen"", which is also known as ""clean hydrogen"". It is produced using renewable energy sources, such as wind or solar power, but it is the most expensive type of hydrogen to produce. That is why hydrogen produced using fossil fuels has been seen by some experts as the first step towards green hydrogen. ""South Korea's hydrogen is currently produced from natural gas,"" Martin Tengler who is BloombergNEF's lead hydrogen analyst says, explaining that it is referred to as ""grey hydrogen"". The next stage in the transition is ""blue hydrogen"", which is also made using fossil fuels but 60% to 90% of the carbon dioxide produced in the process is captured and stored. South Korea's biggest natural gas supplier, SK, has invested 18 trillion won, or around ($15bn; £12bn), but only in grey and blue hydrogen. The boss of its hydrogen business unit, Hyeong-wook Choo, told the BBC the company did not invest in green hydrogen straight away because more technology and investment was needed to do so. With renewable sources of energy and infrastructure to capture and distribute it not readily available in much of Asia, a major challenge has been to develop the right mix of technologies to harness enough energy to mass produce hydrogen. ""We can develop the market by manufacturing, distributing and consuming hydrogen. So when green hydrogen becomes available, there will be more ability to expand this hydrogen business,"" Mr Choo added. The crucial issue behind this is how much it costs to produce each of the different types of gas. ""Green hydrogen costs more than two to three times of grey hydrogen,"" says Mr Heo of S&P Global. ""Currently, it's about $10 per kilogramme to produce green hydrogen."" Mr Heo says to be cost effective, the amount has to decline by 70% to around $3 per kilogramme without government subsidies. But the jump in global energy prices means that ""there's clearly some momentum on green hydrogen because it is produced from renewable energy which is detached from the high fuel prices environment,"" he added. For example in Europe, the costs of producing blue and grey hydrogen at times increased by more than 70% following the Russian invasion of Ukraine, according to the consultancy Rystad Energy. If affordable green hydrogen becomes available, there are a number of industries that can benefit. ""We can replace grey hydrogen in industries where there are no emissions-low alternatives like refining petroleum, producing fertiliser and heavy industries like steel production which require high temperatures,"" Mr Tengler said. To be able to compete globally, South Korea has created a hydrogen alliance which more than a dozen companies have joined. ""The hydrogen industry at the moment is like the solar industry about 20 years ago where there are few projects being developed and there is a big ambition in the market,"" said Mr Heo. Wind power is one of the keys to South Korea's green hydrogen ambitions. A consortium led by Korea Maritime and Ocean University is developing a floating offshore plant to produce green hydrogen in the city of Busan. ""What we're envisioning is to use electricity from wind and solar out at sea, to boil and electrolyse seawater to produce green hydrogen,"" Doh Deog-hee, President of Korea Maritime and Ocean University said. Its advantage is its proximity to hydrogen consumers, Mr Heo said: ""You can save the hydrogen transportation costs because that's a big, very expensive part of the hydrogen value chain."" ""But floating offshore wind costs more than $300 per megawatt hour compared to $100 per megawatt hour of using solar power so how to actually optimise the cost of producing hydrogen from this facility is a big question,"" he added. The transition to cleaner sources of energy has always been costly. When global leaders met for COP26 in November, the world was starting to face higher fuel prices due to the pent-up demand after the pandemic lockdowns. For many countries it was, and still is, very tempting to go back to fossil fuels. The question is whether the soaring fuel prices could be a bigger motivator for a change. "

Flyers containing a phonetic version of the national song were handed out before the match and members of the Tartan Army sang along in solidarity. It was Ukraine's first competitive game since the Russian invasion in February. Amid remarkable scenes they defeated Scotland 3-1 and will now face Wales in Cardiff on Sunday for a place in Qatar. The Ukraine players walked on to the pitch with the national flag draped round their shoulders before an emotionally charged rendition of the national anthem. It was followed by a rousing chorus of Flower of Scotland before the match kicked off at 19:45. But the Tartan Army were silenced after 33 minutes when Andriy Yarmolenko lobbed Scotland goalkeeper Craig Gordon to give the visitors a 1-0 lead at half-time. Just four minutes into the second half a Roman Yaremchuk header doubled Ukraine's lead, before Callum McGregor scored to give the hosts hope with 11 minutes left to play. But deep into injury time Artem Dovbyk scored a third and ended Scotland's World Cup dream. Ahead of the match Scotland's national pipers learned the Ukrainian national anthem to make the visiting fans feel welcome. ""It actually fits perfectly on the scale, it sits nicely with the drone and is a lovely tune for the pipes,"" Finlay MacDonald, the group's director of piping, told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme ""As musicians sometimes you feel kind of useless when there's obviously such a terrible situation going on, but we thought this is something we can offer, playing this tune in support of the Ukrainian people. ""We're all behind Scotland as a football team, but we're definitely behind the Ukrainian people in their bigger battle. It's just a symbol of our support for them."" Some Ukrainians travelled from far afield to be at Hampden. Marco Biuss, a first generation Canadian-Ukrainian, flew to Glasgow from Toronto. ""It's more than just a regular football match,"" he told BBC Scotland. ""Emotions are going to be running high. ""Once we hear the Ukrainian national anthem playing in the stadium, I am sure we will all have tears in our eyes. We hope Ukraine will win and Ukraine will prevail in the war."" John Babiack, a first-generation Ukrainian-American, has been volunteering in Ukraine for two months supporting the Red Cross and other organisations. ""It's a little conflicting for me because I'm here to be a fan and support our national team, but I've just left a war-torn country and it absolutely pulls on the heart strings,"" he said. ""I hope the game will be magnificent and there will be no loser tonight."" Steven Kerr was taking a group of Ukrainian children from the Dnipro Kids charity, who were brought to Scotland earlier this year, to the match. ""They'll have the Ukrainian flag on their cheeks, we've got them all Ukrainian flags and I'm sure it will be very emotional for them,"" he said. ""Given what they've been through, they're all very excited to be able to go and support their home country. ""There'll be no split loyalties for me though. I am in the Ukrainian section with the kids so might have to sit on my hands but I want to see Scotland win and go to the World Cup."" Former Scotland skipper Graeme Souness has sparked debate in recent days after declaring he wants Ukraine to win on Wednesday, to qualify for the World Cup and go on to win it. ""My emotions when I think about it deeply are that it's more important than football to send a message that Russia's behaviour is unacceptable - the world has to unite and tell them that,"" he said. Colin Hendry, who captained the men's team the last time they qualified for a World Cup in 1998, says he ""understands where Graeme is coming from in terms of the bigger picture"" in Ukraine but ""can't agree with it entirely, because sport is sport"". Nevertheless he believes the Ukraine players will receive ""the biggest cheer they've ever heard"" when they walk out at Hampden Park. ""I know The Tartan Army will be fully behind them when they come out for the warm-up,"" he said. Leanne Crichton, part of the Scotland squad at the 2019 Women's World Cup, also agreed the ""entire Hampden roar"" would be felt by both sets of players in the countdown to kick-off. But once the game gets under way, she expected normal service to resume. ""The Scotland players have a job to do and I think the Ukrainian players will also understand and respect the fact that Scotland want to get to a major tournament as much as they do,"" she said. ""For that moment, I think they will be really glad to just focus on football, with everything else that's been going on externally, which has been horrendous. ""They have been in camp for a while now, they have had time to prepare and concentrate on the game, and they will look to drive that emotion into their performance tonight."" Meanwhile in Aberfeldy, Perth and Kinross, Ukrainian refugees and their host families were expected to watch the game in the bar of a local hotel. ""A lot of the families are integrating already in Aberfeldy really well and it'll be a nice occasion to get everybody together,"" owner Gavin Price told Radio Scotland. Tetiana Lukianenko, a Ukrainian refugee now staying in the town with her new baby, husband and father, said the match would be ""quite symbolic for everyone"". ""Whichever team wins, we'll be happy in any case because we are just very happy to be here,"" she said. "

Writing in the New York Times, Mr Biden said the lethal aid would strengthen Ukraine's negotiating position against Russia and make a diplomatic solution more likely. But Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov accused the US of aiming to ""fight Russia to the last Ukrainian"" and said the move discouraged officials in Kyiv from seeking a compromise to end the conflict. President Biden said the weapons, which Ukraine has long asked for, are to help strike enemy forces within Ukraine more precisely and from a longer distance. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Ukraine had promised not to use the new missiles to strike inside Russia, and warned of a long conflict ahead. The intervention comes as fighting intensifies in the eastern Donbas region, where Russia has been accused of ""madness"" by President Volodymyr Zelensky after striking a chemical factory in the city. More graphic accounts of torture have emerged from Ukraine at the hands of Russian soldiers - this time from Kherson in the south of the country. An unnamed doctor describes signs of ""body mutilation"" providing a list that includes cuts and burns, electrocution, binding and strangulation. One man, Olexander, says a bag was put on his head and rope was tied around his neck and wrists. He says he was then beaten and threatened. The BBC's Caroline Davies has heard multiple first-hand testimonies saying that people began to disappear when Russian troops took control of Kherson. Earlier, three of our correspondents spent some time answering questions sent in by members of the public about the war. Life away from the front line can seem relatively normal, says BBC Eastern Europe Correspondent Sarah Rainsford. But she describes the whole of Ukraine as sitting on ""a fear spectrum"" with some civilians being scared into leaving the country. Peace talks aren't a likely option right now, says the BBC's Russia editor, Steve Rosenberg. He told a reader talking is over between both sides and each blame each other - and developments on the battlefield will dictate what happens next with negotiations. Turkey offered to be a mediator, but the offer hasn't been accepted yet. Have more questions? Maybe they've been answered by our correspondents here. Since Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine on 24 February, nearly 15,000 allegations of war crimes have been made against Moscow's forces by Ukrainian civilians and troops. War crimes include the use of weapons that cause indiscriminate or appalling suffering, genocide and the abuse of the rights of prisoners of war. Kyiv's top prosecutor, Iryna Venediktova, says the pace of new allegations has intensified, with 200 to 300 cases being reported every day. Now, in the bombed-out apartment blocks of Ukraine's second city, Kharkiv, investigators are searching for evidence that could help them prosecute Russia's war criminals. Football chants aren't usually done to show support for the opposition. But at tonight's World Cup play-off, Scottish fans were asked to join in singing the Ukrainian anthem in solidarity with the war-torn country. Flyers containing a phonetic version of the song were handed out to spectators at Hampden Park in Glasgow. The match is Ukraine's first competitive game since the start of the Russian invasion back in February. Scotland's national pipers have also been learning the Ukrainian national anthem to make the thousands of visiting fans feel welcome. "
92,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-61655577,2022-06-01T20:17:49,Ukraine war: Russia says US 'adding fuel to fire' by sending longer-range rockets," Russia has accused the US of seeking to prolong the war in Ukraine after President Biden said he would supply Kyiv with new long-range missiles. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the US was ""intentionally adding fuel to the fire"" with the deliveries. ""Such supplies do not contribute to the Ukrainian leadership's willingness to resume peace negotiations,"" he added. Separately, the German government has promised to send an air defence system to Ukraine. Chancellor Olaf Scholz told MPs that the IRIS-T system was the most modern Germany possessed and would enable Ukraine to defend an entire city against Russian air attacks. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov hit out against the deliveries and said Mr Biden's announcement increased the risk of a ""third country"" being dragged into the conflict. The long-range missiles are to help Ukrainian troops strike enemy forces more precisely from a longer distance. The US had previously been unwilling to provide the weapons out of fear they could be used against targets in Russia, but the US says Kyiv has given assurances that this will not happen. On Wednesday, Mr Biden said the lethal aid would strengthen Kyiv's negotiating position against Russia and make a diplomatic solution more likely. A senior US official said the new weapons package would include four M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS). ""These are precision guided systems with extended range. And so for high value targets that that allow them to keep some of the pressure off of Ukrainian forces on the front, we think these systems will be very useful,"" Undersecretary for Defense Dr Colin H Kahl said. The systems can launch multiple precision-guided missiles at targets as far as 70km (45 miles) away - far further than the artillery that Ukraine currently has. They are also believed to be more accurate than their Russian equivalents. This announcement has been a long time coming and represents one of the most significant military commitments so far. As they face overwhelming Russian firepower in a grinding, attritional battle for the Donbas, Ukrainian forces complain that they lack firepower. The HIMARS could change that. Its GPS-guided rockets are much more accurate than the equivalent Russian systems. It's also much quicker to reload and, as the name suggests, the launch vehicles can move quickly from one location to another. US and Ukrainian officials will already be having detailed conversations about how and where to use the HIMARS when they arrive. Ukraine will be looking to hit targets well beyond its current reach - command and control centres, logistics hubs, and the Russian batteries that have Ukrainian troops pinned down in Donbas. White House officials agreed to provide the rockets, they said, only after gaining assurances from President Volodomyr Zelensky that the weapons would not be used to attack targets inside Russia. ""We are not going to send to Ukraine rocket systems that can strike into Russia,"" Mr Biden wrote on Wednesday. Mr Zelensky confirmed this in an interview for US network Newsmax. ""We're not interested in what is happening in Russia,"" he said. ""We're only interested in our own territory in Ukraine."" But Mr Peskov said Moscow did not trust Mr Zelensky's remarks. ""In order to have trust, we need to have experience of Kyiv fulfilling its promises, but there is none,"" he said, quoted by Ria news agency. Addressing the US announcement, he said: ""We believe the US is directly and intentionally adding fuel to the fire... The US is obviously holding the line that it will fight Russia to the last Ukrainian."" The latest rockets will be the centrepiece of a $700m (£556m) support package for Ukraine that will be formally unveiled later on Wednesday, White House officials said. Helicopters, anti-tank weapons, tactical vehicles and spare parts are to be included in what will be the 11th package of military aid approved by the US for Ukraine since the invasion began in February. Meanwhile fighting has intensified around the eastern city of Severodonetsk, where the head of the city administration says Ukrainian forces now hold just 20% of the city. Mr Zelensky accused Russia of ""madness"" after its troops targeted the city's chemical factory Azot during an artillery barrage. Regional head Serhiy Gaidai said civilians were sheltering from missile and artillery attacks at the plant. ""There are civilians there in bomb shelters, there are quite a few of them, but it will not be a second Azovstal as that plant had a huge underground city … which isn't there at Azot,"" Mr Gaidai said. Capturing Severodonetsk, the final major city still held by Ukraine in the Luhansk region, is a key aim of Russia's invasion and Western officials say Moscow is making ""incremental but pretty steady gains"".

War crimes include the use of weapons that cause indiscriminate or appalling suffering, genocide and the abuse of the rights of prisoners of war. Since Russia began its invasion of Ukraine on 24 February, nearly 15,000 war crimes have been alleged across the country, with 200 to 300 more being reported daily, according to Ukraine's chief prosecutor, Iryna Venediktova. © 2022 BBC.

94,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-61666358,2022-06-01T16:56:38,Ukraine war: Your questions on the conflict answered," It's been 98 days since Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine and events on the ground remain complex and fast-moving. Moscow's forces have been pushed back from the capital city of Kyiv, and the troops dispatched by Vladimir Putin towards the second city of Kharkiv have been forced across the border back into Russia - but intense fighting continues. Our correspondents on the ground have been answering your questions about how the war is progressing and whether Ukraine can survive the Russian onslaught. They are: David Perdue, in Washington DC, asks: Has Russia's ground offensive practically stalled? What further Ukrainian territory will Russia look to occupy, if any? After initial setbacks, Russian troops seem to be making gains in eastern Ukraine. But what's Moscow's objective? If Russia occupies the whole of Donetsk and Luhansk regions, will the Kremlin stop or push on for more territory? Even if Russia does call a halt, there's no guarantee it would be a permanent cessation of hostilities. They say a leopard doesn't change its spots… neither, I suspect, would Russia's president. In speeches and articles Vladimir Putin has made it clear that he does not see Ukraine as a sovereign nation; instead he views it as a territory that belongs historically in Moscow's orbit. After launching his ""special military operation"", the Kremlin leader seems to have expected the government in Kyiv to fall quickly. He even called on the Ukrainian military to rise up and overthrow the Ukrainian leadership. That didn't happen. But that doesn't mean Vladimir Putin has given up on the idea of forcing Ukraine back into Moscow's sphere of influence - even in the face of Western sanctions. This question comes from SC Bhargava: Why is it that Ukraine has been mostly defensive? Why has it not attacked military and civilian targets inside Russia? This is a war Ukraine did not choose and did not start. It's defensive in its very nature: the country is fighting for its right to exist against an all-out Russian attack. I don't think you can underestimate what it has cost Ukraine to stop Russia taking Kyiv, and now to try and halt the advance of Russian troops across the Donbas. Openly and deliberately targeting Russia itself would be a major escalation at a time when Ukraine is battling to hold the line. The pleas from Kyiv for more weapons from the West are constant. But the US recently made very clear that the longer-range missiles it will provide are not for hitting Russian territory: it fears an escalation. Remember, the West judged it too risky to impose a no-fly zone over Ukraine when Kyiv was begging for that at the start. As for Ukraine targeting Russian civilians? That would be a war crime. Isobel McRae-Morris asks about reports that some Russian soldiers have been refusing to fight in Ukraine, with some conscripts deserting their positions. Is this really happening? Yes, although it's hard to know the scale. The thing is, Russia hasn't officially declared war: Vladimir Putin insists on calling his invasion a ""special operation"" and that means professional soldiers can refuse to take part. They can be fired, but they can't - or shouldn't - be prosecuted. Still, it takes some guts to actually do it. From my own reporting in Ukraine, I know that many of the Russian soldiers deployed at the start of this invasion were young and inexperienced; some didn't know they were going to war, others thought they'd take Kyiv in days, without resistance. But the proof of heavy battles and heavy losses is everywhere, including in the refrigerated train carriages I've seen piled up with dead Russian soldiers. So it doesn't surprise me that some would refuse to fight, especially now they've seen for themselves that Ukraine doesn't want ""liberating"". But we're not seeing reports of mass desertion. Philip Withers asks: Why has Nato not moved to protect the Black Sea port of Odesa, given that the Black Sea is international waters? There are lots of complicated reasons for this. Firstly, Nato is not directly involved in the conflict and wants to keep it that way. Second, the Montreux Convention, which regulates maritime access to the Black Sea, gives Turkey a say over which non-Black Sea states are allowed to pass in and out through the Bosphorus. Turkey has much closer relations with Moscow than almost all other Nato members (with the exception of Hungary) and wants to be seen as a mediator between Russia and Ukraine. Any move to forcibly break Russia's blockade of Odesa would inevitably be seen by Moscow as a hostile move. Britain and Lithuania recently indicated that they wanted to see a ""coalition of the willing"" to protect commercial shipping in and out of Odesa, in an effort to allow Ukraine to export its badly needed agricultural products, especially grain, around the world. But plans have yet to take shape. In the meantime, a Danish decision to supply Ukraine with American-made Harpoon missiles, combined with Ukraine's own Neptune system (which was responsible for sinking the Moskva, the flagship of Russia's Black Sea fleet) mean that, for now, Odesa is not likely to be attacked from the sea. The next question comes from reader Jayesh who asks whether Russia and Ukraine are holding any peace talks at the moment on establishing a ceasefire. Talks between Russia and Ukraine started up soon after the Russian invasion. There were several rounds of negotiations, but they didn't produce any agreement. For now, the talking's over. Both sides blame each other for that. But remember: if Russian forces hadn't attacked Ukraine in the first place, there'd be no need for a ceasefire! It's likely that developments on the battlefield will dictate when, how and in what format negotiations resume. This week, President Erdogan of Turkey talked by phone with his Ukrainian and Russian counterparts and offered to mediate in the conflict. Russia's current military aim appears to be to seize and occupy (or ""liberate"" as the Russians put it) the whole of the Donbas region. Moscow may not be ready for a ceasefire until it manages that. One reader, Johnny, writes: When are countries going to stop acting scared of Russia and stand up to them? Are Ukraine's Western backers scared or merely acting cautiously? Some, like the Baltic republics, have voiced frustration over what they see as the West's reluctance to give Ukraine everything it needs. But for all Russia's military deficiencies - which have been cruelly exposed over more than three months of a frequently bungled campaign - it is still armed with a vast arsenal of nuclear weapons which it has hinted it could use. Western officials continue to believe that Moscow is unlikely to resort to such doomsday options, but they cannot simply act as if such dangers didn't exist. And while some, including the British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss, seem happy to talk about expelling Russian forces from the whole of Ukraine, others see a return to the situation that existed on the morning of 24 February as a more likely and feasible scenario. This would leave Russia in control of the Crimean peninsula, which it annexed in 2014, as well as significant chunks of the eastern Donbas. Lois Barakat Ichelson says: In light of new EU oil embargoes, which will be tougher by the end of the year, are the oligarchs organised, powerful and motivated enough to oust President Putin? He goes on to ask whether there are any other groups or forces in the country that could remove him. Considering the highly secretive nature of Kremlin politics, it's only natural that there's lots of rumour and speculation about the man at the top; after all, it's Putin who takes all key decisions in the country. So… is Vladimir Putin seriously ill? Are the knives being sharpened ahead of a ""palace coup""? Are the oligarchs plotting to overthrow the president? Much of this, I suspect, is wishful thinking on the part of President Putin's detractors. Of course, not everyone in the corridors of Kremlin power will be happy with what Russia's doing in Ukraine and the international sanctions Moscow has brought upon itself. But, right now, there's no hint of an anti-Putin coup - and that includes amongst the oligarchs, whose wings the Kremlin clipped long ago. Mind you, if you were Vladimir Putin, would you be taking any chances? That may explain why the head of the Russian National Guard is an ex-Putin bodyguard. According to Russian media reports, so, too, is Russia's new Emergencies Minister, promoted last week. "

All local and regional transport on trains, buses and metro is included in the government's initiative, although inter-city trains are not. The cheap tickets are also aimed at getting people to leave their cars. However, fuel tax has also been reduced by around 30 cents a litre for petrol, bringing prices down below €2. The tax has been brought down to the EU minimum, again for the next three months, so diesel prices are also being cut by around 14 cents a litre. Transport Minister Volker Wissing has described the €9-a-month tickets as a great opportunity: ""It's a success that we've already sold seven million tickets."" However, rail company Deutsche Bahn is already struggling with overcrowding, delays and cancellations and the prospect of millions of extra passengers has prompted criticism of the plan. Fewer than 70% of long-distance trains were on time in April, but Mr Wissing says the rail network is only running at 80% capacity. No major rail problems were reported in the hours after the scheme kicked in on Wednesday morning. As in much of the rest of the world, Germans have been hit by rising energy prices, with inflation up to 7.9% last month. Chancellor Olaf Scholz told members of the German parliament on Wednesday that the main cause of the increase in prices was Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The federal government, which includes the Green party, has promised Germany's 16 state authorities €2.5bn in compensation for the extra costs expected in staffing and fuel. Although the €9-ticket does not include inter-city travel, it is possible to cross the country using regional trains. The scheme prompted German social media users to discuss whether to use the ticket to travel to work, or head to the beach on the North Sea holiday island of Sylt. Cologne library announced humorously: ""We have moved tomorrow's social media team meeting to Sylt. FYI"". Several other measures are being taken to alleviate the rising cost of living: "
96,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-61607410,2022-05-31T23:08:57,Ukraine war: Stories of torture emerging out of Kherson," While his homemade borsch bubbles on the hob, Olexander Guz shows me pictures of his bruised body on his phone. The injuries, he says, were inflicted by the Russian authorities. ""They put a bag on my head,"" Olexander tells me. ""The Russians threatened that I would not have kidneys left."" The BBC has gathered several graphic testimonies of residents in Kherson who say they were tortured. Warning: this report contains some graphic content that readers may find distressing. Olexander used to live in Bilozerka, a small village in the Kherson region. He was one of the village's deputies. As a young man he was a conscript in the army, but now runs his own business. He and his wife were publicly anti-Russia: she attended pro-Ukrainian rallies, he tried to stop Russian troops entering their village. It wasn't long after Russia took over that soldiers came looking for him. ""They tied a rope around my neck and another around my wrists,"" he recalls. He says they told him to stand with his legs wide apart while they questioned him. ""When I didn't answer them, they hit me between my legs. When I fell, I started to suffocate. As you try to get up, they beat you. Then they ask again."" Russian troops took control of Kherson, in southern Ukraine, early in the war. Ukrainian TV stations were quickly replaced with Russian state broadcasts. Western products were changed for Russian alternatives. According to multiple first-hand testimonies, people also began to disappear. Piecing together what is happening inside Kherson is difficult. As Russia has tightened its grip on the region, people have become increasingly frightened to speak out. Those who manage to leave often delete all the photos and videos from their phones for fear of being stopped and detained at Russian checkpoints. Olexander sent images of his injuries to his son, who was abroad, for safe keeping before wiping his phone. It means to corroborate testimonies, it is necessary to speak to multiple people who say they have been victims of torture. Oleh Baturin is one of them. He was a journalist for an independent newspaper in the Kherson region. Within days of Russia's invasion, he says he was kidnapped. ""They shouted, 'On your knees',"" he says. ""They covered my face... and put my hands behind my back. They beat me on the back, ribs and legs... and hit me with the butt of a machine gun."" It was only later, when he went to see a doctor, that Oleh realised they had broken four of his ribs. He says he was imprisoned for eight days. In that time, he heard others being tortured and witnessed a young man's mock execution. Both Olexander and Oleh are now in Ukrainian-held territory. They provided the BBC with photos of what they said were police reports of the abuse. Some allegations of torture are particularly graphic. I spoke to one doctor who worked in a hospital in Kherson. He asked to remain anonymous, but provided me with a picture of his hospital ID. ""There were signs of bodily mutilation,"" he says, listing haematomas (localised bleeding outside blood vessels that appears as a bad bruise), abrasions, cut marks, signs of electrocution, traces of binding on the hands and strangulation marks on the neck. He says he also saw burns on people's feet and hands, and that one patient told him he was beaten with a hose filled with sand. ""Some of the worst were burn marks on genitals, a gunshot wound to the head of a girl who was raped and burns from an iron on a patient's back and stomach. The patient told me two wires from a car battery were attached to his groin and he was told to stand on a wet rag"", the doctor adds. He believes there were many others severely injured who did not receive treatment. Some stay at home because they are too intimidated to go outside. And some, he says, are ""psychologically pressured"" by the Russians. ""They threaten that their families will be killed, and they intimidate them in every possible way."" He says he asked the patients why they had been picked by the Russian authorities. ""They were tortured if they did not want to go over to the Russian side, for being at rallies, for being in the territorial defence, for the fact that one of the family members fought against the separatists, some got there randomly."" Some people are afraid their loved ones could be next. Victoria (not her real name) fears for her parents, who are still in Kherson. Her father used to be in the Ukrainian territorial defence and has already been kidnapped and beaten once, she tells me. ""They dropped him in the middle of a field. When he got home, after a few minutes he burst into tears, even though he is not a sentimental person. I'm trying to help, but it all made me feel like a little girl."" Now Victoria worries it could happen again. The BBC is not the only one investigating what is going on in Kherson. Both the UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine and Human Rights Watch have told us they are also concerned about the allegations of torture and enforced disappearances. Belkis Wille, from Human Rights Watch, says the testimony gathered by the BBC is consistent with what they are hearing. She says the concern is that Russian forces, in areas they are occupying, are continuing to a certain extent to ""terrorise the local civilian population and use abusive practices like arbitrary detention and forced disappearance and torture"". ""These are potential war crimes we're looking at,"" she adds. The Russian Ministry of Defence did not respond to the BBC's request for comment. Previously, the Kremlin spokesperson said allegations of war crimes in Bucha were ""obvious fakes and the most egregious ones are staged, as has been convincingly proved by our experts."" Exactly what is happening in Kherson is near impossible to establish from the outside, but as more testimonies are gathered, many paint a picture of fear, intimidation, violence and repression. Victoria is trying to get her parents out. ""In Kherson, now people go missing all the time,"" she tells me. ""There is a war going on, only this part is without bombs."" "
97,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-61652467,2022-05-31T21:14:16,"Ukraine reports 15,000 suspected war crimes"," Around 15,000 suspected war crimes have been reported in Ukraine since the war began, with 200 to 300 more reported daily, its chief prosecutor said. Some 600 suspects have been identified and 80 prosecutions have begun, Iryna Venediktova told reporters in The Hague. The list of suspects includes ""top military, politicians and propaganda agents of Russia"", she added. Russia has denied targeting civilians or involvement in war crimes. Of the 15,000 alleged war crimes, Ms Veneditkova said several thousand had been identified in the eastern Donbas region - the scene of fierce fighting between Russian and Ukrainian troops. Alleged war crimes in the region include the possible forcible transfer of people - including cases of adults and children - to different parts of Russia, Ms Venediktova said. Torture, the killing of civilians and the destruction of civilian infrastructure are also suspected war crimes, she added. Though investigations relating to the eastern region have started, Ukrainian authorities do not have access to Russian-held areas, AFP news agency reports Ms Venediktova as saying. They were, however, interviewing evacuees and prisoners-of-war, she added. ""Investigations are very difficult when fighting is going on at the same time,"" she is quoted as saying by German news agency DPA. Estonia, Latvia and Slovakia have also joined the investigation efforts, Ms Venediktova said. Poland and Lithuania were already helping. The International Criminal Court described Ukraine as a ""crime scene"" and has despatched its largest team of investigators ever to Ukraine to assist in the investigations. It said it was also hoping to open an office in Ukraine's capital Kyiv. The announcements came as two Russian soldiers were jailed for 11 and a half years in Ukraine on Tuesday for shelling civilian areas. The first Russian soldier to be put on trial in Ukraine, Sgt Vadim Shishimarin, was sentenced to life in prison for killing a civilian last week. Ukraine's ombudsman for human rights, Lyudmila Denisova, was also sacked by Ukraine's parliament. She was criticised for not organising humanitarian corridors and facilitating prisoner exchanges, as well as her handling of alleged rape cases against Russian soldiers, according to local media reports. Ms Denisova said she would appeal the decision. On the ground, Ukrainian and Russian forces battled for control of the eastern city of Severodonetsk in the Luhansk region. The city is said to be divided between the two sides - but not equally. Regional governor Serhiy Haidai said ""70%-80% of the city is controlled by the Russian army"". An explosion also reportedly hit a nitric acid container in the city, which is thought to have been caused by an airstrike, Mr Haidai said. He told the BBC toxic fumes were released into the air following the explosion, but only in a small area. Russia now occupies almost all of Luhansk, as it focuses on seizing it and neighbouring Donetsk. Away from the fighting, European Union leaders reached political agreement to ban 90% of oil imports from Russia, excluding pipeline oil, which Hungary had opposed. But EU members remain split over Russian gas exports. Russian oil giant Gazprom also announced it would be cutting gas supplies to Denmark's Orsted, as well as Shell Europe for its supplies to Germany, after both companies failed to make payments in roubles - something Russia has demanded. "
98,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-61650698,2022-05-31T19:22:17,Ukraine round-up: City divided and refugee spots her looted goods," The 97th day of the war saw Ukrainian and Russian forces battling for control of the eastern city of Severodonetsk, which is said to be divided between the two sides. Up to 15,000 people may still be trapped there, Luhansk regional governor Serhiy Haidai said. Both sides are suffering heavy casualties and the Ukrainian command may decide a tactical retreat would better serve their medium-term interests. ""As soon as we can get more weapons, particularly those artillery weapons which are being shipped right now from the West, we can go to counter-offensive,"" Ukrainian former Defence Minister Andriy Zagorodnyuk told the BBC. Russia now occupies almost all of Luhansk, as it focuses on seizing it and neighbouring Donetsk. At least 3,052 of its soldiers have been killed since the invasion began on 24 February, according to a list of names compiled by BBC News Russian. There can be few stories more harrowing than that of Hlib Stryzhko, an injured Ukrainian prisoner-of-war who somehow survived his ordeal, released in a prisoner exchange. While defending the port of Mariupol, he was fired at by a tank and fell three floors. As the BBC's James Waterhouse reports, after his capture he endured psychological torture and was denied medical treatment for a broken pelvis and jaw. He said he could not believe he was back in Ukraine, ""a place where you can breathe freely"". A Ukrainian refugee in the UK says she got a surprise when her husband showed her a photo of a Russian tank - with some of her household items sitting on top. Alina Koreniuk says the box in the photo contains a new boiler she planned to install before the war started - along with some new sheets. She and her children left Ukraine on 8 April and are staying with a British couple in Nottinghamshire. The picture, taken in late May, shows the tank moving past bombed residential buildings in the town of Popasna. Many residents of occupied areas of Ukraine have complained of looting by Russian troops and, as the BBC's Robert Greenall reports, the prospect of looting was not unexpected for Ms Koreniuk. The European Union agreed a deal to block all Russian oil imports arriving by sea, and cut overall imports by 90% by the end of the year. Weeks of wrangling failed to get that number to 100%, with Hungary's Prime Minister Viktor Orban holding out against a complete ban - because Hungary still relies on Russian pipelines for its oil. Oil prices hit fresh highs in response, with Brent crude rising above $123 a barrel, the highest it had been for two months. And, as the BBC's Reality Check points out, the EU will still use Russian gas (rather than oil) because other countries like Germany depend on it. Read their piece on the world's reliance on Russian oil and gas here. And to cap off the day, energy giant Shell has reassured customers it will keep gas flowing after Russian energy frim Gazprom said it would cut supplies. Kvitka Perehinets, a Ukrainian student at the University of Edinburgh, has been anxiously following the war in her home country from a distance. Most of her family are there - some of them fighting - and she told the BBC she was distressed by recent tweets by a politics professor, which appeared to cast doubt on the bombing of a maternity hospital in Mariupol by the Russians. The professor, though, argues that the pursuit of knowledge involves hearing both sides. Read our in-depth story about the row here. Wednesday night sees the Ukrainian national football team take its latest step on the road to the World Cup in Qatar. They go to Glasgow to play Scotland, and the winners will face Wales next Sunday for a place in the finals. Andriy Smondulak will be among those Ukrainians supporting their national side. He expects an ""extremely emotional"" occasion. ""I think goose bumps will be felt around the world,"" he told BBC. Fellow fan Martyn Chymera, who was travelling from Manchester for the match, suggested football fans across the globe would be backing the away team. ""I am sure everyone, apart from Scotland, will be behind Ukraine on Wednesday,"" he said. "
99,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-61652931,2022-05-31T18:07:15,Russian gas firm Gazprom to cut some supply to Shell," Shell has said it will work to keep gas flowing to its customers in Europe after Russian energy firm Gazprom said it would cut supplies from tomorrow. Gazprom said it would halt gas to Denmark's Orsted and to Shell for its contract to supply gas to Germany, after both refused to make payments in roubles, Reuters reported. Shell told the BBC it would continue to get gas from its other sources. The gas giant said it would continue to phase out Russian fossil fuels. The move by Gazprom comes after European Union leaders said they will block most Russian oil imports by the end of 2022 to punish Moscow for invading Ukraine. In response to Western sanctions, Russia has already cut off gas supplies to Poland, Bulgaria, Finland and the Netherlands, after the countries refused to comply with Russian demands to switch to payment in roubles. The latest move expands that retaliation to Germany and Denmark. Vladimir Putin's decree has been seen as an attempt to boost the Russian currency, which has been hit by sanctions, as more foreign exchange demand for roubles is likely to increase demand and push up its value. Shell told the BBC it had not agreed to ""new payment terms set out by Gazprom"", which included the creation of Russian bank accounts. ""We will work to continue supplying our customers in Europe through our diverse portfolio of gas supply,"" a spokesman said. ""Shell continues to work on a phased withdrawal from Russian hydrocarbons, in compliance with applicable laws and regulations."" Meanwhile, Orsted said on Monday that Gazprom stopping gas flows would put Denmark's supplies at risk. Shell has taken a hit of $5bn (£3.8bn) from offloading its Russian assets as part of its plans to withdraw sever ties with the country. It also confirmed it had quit its joint ventures with Gazprom. The firm pledged in April to no longer buy oil from Russia, but said contracts signed before the invasion of Ukraine would be fulfilled. Shell was criticised when it bought Russian crude oil at a cheap price shortly after the war began. The war in Ukraine has pushed countries in the West to phase out Russian energy supplies. Europe gets about 40% of its natural gas from Russia, which is also the bloc's main oil supplier, but some countries are more dependent Russian fossil fuels than others, so sudden supply cuts could have huge economic impact. Nathan Piper, head of oil and gas research at Investec, said it was ""clear"" that European countries and companies was want to reduce imports of Russian fossil fuels. However he warned of the ""ongoing risk that efforts to reduce Russian oil and gas imports results in higher oil and gas prices"", limiting the impact on Russia. ""Russian volumes may gradually be reduced but they are 'compensated' by higher overall prices,"" he added. He said the geopolitical tensions were set against ""an already tight oil and gas market prior to the invasion of Ukraine"". Countries have been filling gas storage sites ahead of winter due to the threats of Russian supply cuts. So far, no sanctions on Russian gas exports to the EU have been put in place, although plans to open a new gas pipeline from Russia to Germany have been frozen. Meanwhile the EU leaders have agreed an immediate ban on Russian oil being transported into the bloc by sea. In late March, Russia said ""unfriendly countries"" would have to start paying for its oil and gas in roubles after Western allies froze billions of dollars it held in foreign currencies overseas. Under the decree, European importers must pay euros or dollars into an account at Gazprombank, the Swiss-based trading arm of Gazprom, and then convert this into roubles in a second account in Russia. The majority - 97% - of EU companies' gas supply contracts with Gazprom stipulate payment in euros or dollars. "
100,https://www.bbc.com/news/58888451,2022-05-31T17:27:27,Russia sanctions: Can the world cope without its oil and gas?," The European Union has agreed to ban all Russian oil imports which come in by sea. It says new sanctions against President Putin's ""war machine"" could cut the amount of oil it buys from Russia by 90%. The US and UK have also announced bans on Russian fossil fuels. Russia has been supplying about a quarter of the oil EU countries import. That is about 2.2 million barrels per day of crude oil and 1.2 million barrels of oil products. According to the Carnegie Endowment, a US think tank, this has been earning Russia more than $1bn (£800m) a day. The EU plans to ban Russian oil imports arriving by sea by the end of this year. This would cut EU nations' oil imports from Russia by two-thirds. The EU will continue to allow 800,000 bpd of oil imports brought in by pipeline, as a ""temporary measure"". That's because countries like Hungary and Slovakia depend on it. However, Germany and Poland - which also import Russian oil by pipeline - say they will stop doing so by the end of this year. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen says that after this, Russia will only be exporting ""10 or 11%"" of the oil it had previously been selling to EU states. In addition to the EU's measures, the US has declared a complete ban on Russian oil, gas and coal imports. The UK is to phase out Russian oil imports by the end of the year. The EU has called its sanctions a ""landmark decision to cripple Putin's war machine"". Helped by soaring energy prices, Russia received an estimated €400bn ($430bn, £341bn) over the past year from oil and gas exports to Europe. The EU hopes it will lose a big chunk of this revenue. However, its sanctions will take several months to come into full effect, and even then Russia will be able to sell its oil elsewhere around the world. ""Countries in Asia might buy up to one million barrels per day more crude oil from Russia than they are taking now,"" says David Fyfe, chief economist with energy data firm Argus Media. ""As a result of all the sanctions announced so far, Russia may lose between one third and a half of its total oil revenues, but not all of them."" A lot of European nations could have their oil supplies squeezed by the ban on Russian imports. Lithuania and Finland got about 80% of their oil from Russia in November last year. However, EU countries can always buy oil from other producers. Added to this, more oil is being put onto world markets. The IEA - a club of oil importing countries - have released 120m barrels-worth of crude from their stocks. US President Joe Biden ordered a major release of oil from America's reserves. ""Nations like Saudi Arabia might start putting more oil onto the world market later in the year, and there could be more supplies from the US,"" says Kate Dourian, fellow at the Arab Gulf States Institute in Washington, DC. Russia supplies the EU with 40% of the natural gas it imports. Its government has been taking advantage of the hold over European nations this gives it. President Putin demanded that ""unfriendly"" nations in Europe pay for gas in roubles, to help him prop up the value of the currency. Poland, Bulgaria and Finland refused to do so and Russia cut off their supplies. The EU has said it considers Russia's action to be a form of blackmail. In March, the EU committed to reducing gas imports from Russia by two-thirds within a year. However, it has been hard to get agreement on any further measures, such as an outright import ban. Germany, Europe's largest economy, relies on Russia for almost half of its gas supply. There's doubt over whether EU nations will be able to find other gas supplies than Russia's. ""It would have to turn to producers such the US and Qatar, which would ship liquefied natural gas (LNG) in tankers,"" says Kate Dourian. ""But there aren't enough LNG terminals in Europe. This is will be a problem for Germany, particularly. It simply doesn't have the equipment to unload it."" Consumers face rising energy and fuel bills as sanctions on Russian energy kick in. Heating prices - already high - are likely to increase even more if Russian gas exports to Europe are restricted. In the UK, household energy bills have been kept in check by an energy price cap. But bills rose £700 to about £2,000 in April when the cap was increased. They are expected to reach about £3,000 when the cap is increased again this autumn. UK petrol and diesel prices have also soared, and the government has announced a cut in fuel duty as motorists struggle with record prices. Read more from Reality Check Send us your questions "

Just three months after the Russian invasion, they will be playing Ukraine for the chance of a place in the World Cup in Qatar. Whatever the result, it is likely to be an emotional match for supporters and players on both sides of the pitch. Ukrainian fans have been telling BBC Scotland what the football match means to them. Andriy Smondulak will be among those Ukrainians supporting their national side at Hampden Park on Wednesday. He expects the occasion to be ""extremely emotional"" from the moment their national anthem is played. ""I think goose bumps will be felt around the world,"" he told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme. ""Ukrainians in the stadium will be singing their hearts out."" ""I think Hampden Park will temporarily feel like an opera house with so much emotion and drama, both on and off the pitch,"" he added. The match will be Ukraine's first competitive fixture since the Russian invasion on 24 February. The winners will face Wales in Cardiff on Sunday for a place in Qatar where they will be in a group with England, USA and Iran. Mr Smondulak said Wednesday's match was ""immensely symbolic for us and immensely political as well"". ""It is about showing the world that, despite the immense horrors of the war and the fact that Ukraine is defending itself against the second most powerful military in the world, miracles do happen,"" he added. ""We are praying for a very small miracle this Wednesday."" He hopes that the match - like Ukraine's Eurovision Song Contest win earlier this month - will provide some respite in his homeland. He added: ""It is only for a short period of 90 minutes during which people will forget about the horrors that have been inflicted on them. ""But, unfortunately, there will be no respite for the soldiers who I am sure will come under immense military pressure during the actual game."" Martyn Chymera, who is travelling from Manchester for the match, believes the timing of the game is hugely significant. He told Good Morning Scotland: ""At the moment I think what is going on in Ukraine is going off the headlines so this again is an opportunity to remind people. ""Also it is an opportunity to stand up and sing our anthem and sing about the freedom of Ukraine, which is completely important at the minute while our men are fighting for their freedom."" Mr Chymera said football fans across the globe will be backing the away team. ""I think everybody will be sympathetic with Ukraine. We saw that recently in Eurovision, just a couple of weeks ago,"" he said. ""I am sure everyone, apart from Scotland, will be behind Ukraine on Wednesday."" Meanwhile, Michael Kerr has split loyalties as his mother is Ukrainian but his father is Scottish. He told BBC's The Sunday Show: ""I am toying with wearing a kilt and a Ukraine top to show 50/50 but either way I am going to celebrate."" Mr Kerr, who is on the committee of an Edinburgh-based Ukraine social club, anticipates there will be tears during the national anthem. But when the action gets under way he expects Steve Clarke's men to come out on top. Mr Kerr said: ""My heart says Ukraine because of the political situation but my head says Scotland have the best players and will edge it - plus home advantage as well. ""There's only about 200-300 of us in the away end so we are going to be drowned out on the day."" Last week Scotland captain Andy Robertson said Scotland must detach their sympathy for Ukraine from their own desire of getting to a World Cup finals for the first time since 1998. The Liverpool left back told BBC Scotland: ""Probably everyone in the world wants Ukraine to win. ""If it was any other country, I would probably want them to win but unfortunately they're playing against my country and we have to stand in their way."" Meanwhile, Manchester City defender Oleksandr Zinchenko said ""it's not necessary to talk about motivation"" for Ukraine as they bid to make their war-torn homeland proud. He told told the BBC's World Football podcast: ""Ukraine is still alive. ""Ukraine is going to fight until the end. This is our mentality. We never give up. ""I'm so grateful and so thankful for all the support around the world. Scotland are such a good team. They have unbelievable fans."" "

He will be in the away end for Wednesday's match at Hampden and was torn when asked for his big match verdict. Mr Kerr told BBC Scotland: ""I can't take a draw, can I?

The 11-year-old silver Mercedes truck was attacked by Russian forces while evacuating civilians; despite being labelled a humanitarian aid vehicle. A Ukrainian foreign ministry official said it was hit on Monday near the city of Severodonetsk in eastern Ukraine. The truck had also been delivering baby food and medical equipment out there. Gloucester City Councillor Alastair Chambers, one of the volunteers who helped organise the relief effort, told the Local Democracy Reporting service (LDRS) he was shocked to see pictures of the attack. He said: ""The lorry was picked up from Preston Fleet Services and then we drove it to Gloucester to fill it up with humanitarian aid. ""Baby stuff, things for elderly people, food and equipment. ""We drove it into the Ukraine. ""I handed the keys over to Ukrainians there who told me the lorry was going to be used for evacuations. ""It's been evacuating people for the last three weeks from when we dropped it off. ""At the same time, we dropped off a lot of medical equipment for Mykolaiv hospital which included anaesthesia machines, C-arm X-ray machines and other equipment. ""It's really devastating. ""We've dropped off six vehicles, so this is the first one we know of that has been attacked. ""Apparently, my contacts think it was hit by shrapnel from a Russian missile. But I've also heard another story from a local who said it was hit by fire from a Russian BMPT Terminator vehicle. ""The vehicle is clearly marked out as humanitarian aid. ""At the time it had 10 refugees in it which were being evacuated by a local policeman and a French journalist who was documenting the evacuation process."" "

Alina Koreniuk says the box in the photo contains a new boiler she planned to install before the war started. She and her children left Ukraine on 8 April and are staying with a British couple in Nottinghamshire. The picture, taken in late May, shows the tank moving past bombed residential buildings in the town of Popasna. Russian forces have been in control of the town, in the Luhansk region, since 8 May. Ms Koreniuk says the photo was taken on a street just five minutes away from her house. It was originally spotted by her husband. ""He said: 'Do you notice anything strange about this photo,' and asked me if I saw what he saw in it,"" she told the BBC. Apart from the boiler, other items on the tank include a tablecloth from the family's summer house, new Disney bedsheets for her children and a red blanket, she says. The bed linen was used to cover something, Ms Koreniuk added, probably a TV or other electronic equipment, all of which had been left at the house when they were forced to leave. But she wasn't surprised by what had happened. ""Our reaction was that whatever they hadn't destroyed they would steal,"" she said. ""We expected houses in Popasna to be looted, we'd been told many times about this."" Ms Koreniuk has been staying in Southwell, Nottinghamshire, with her daughters Kristina, 12, and Olha, eight, under the UK government's Homes for Ukraine scheme since leaving Ukraine. Their hosts are thought to be among the first in the country to register for the scheme. A policewoman and former child psychologist, Ms Koreniuk and her family left Popasna on 24 February when the invasion began. Shelling had already started in the area. The family took very few of their possessions when they left. Her mother was forced to leave behind a pet dog, which was killed either by shrapnel or by the occupying forces. Ms Koreniuk described the difficult journey she and her two daughters made out of Ukraine to local media in the UK. Her mother, grandmother and husband are still in Ukraine but in relative safety. Many residents of occupied areas of Ukraine have complained of looting by Russian troops. Last week the independent Russian news site Mediazona published a report suggesting that Russian troops had sent home 58 tonnes of looted goods from areas close to the Ukrainian borders with Russia and Belarus since the start of the invasion. The packages are said to contain items such as sneakers, canned food, TVs, car tyres and tents. Russia has not responded to allegations of looting, but officials have accused Ukraine of filming fake videos to accuse Russia of looting. They have also accused Ukraine of overseeing bands of looters in areas under its control. "
105,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-61637915,2022-05-31T14:06:32,How a Ukrainian prisoner of war survived Russian captivity and made it home," Hlib Stryzhko endured psychological torture and was denied medical treatment for a broken pelvis and jaw. Yet somehow, he made it home. In a hospital bed in the Ukrainian city of Poltava, he tried to sit up. The 25-year-old soldier's pelvis was supported by metal scaffolding - one of his many injuries sustained while trying to defend Mariupol, nearly 500km to the south. As his mother Olesya helped him he grimaced with pain, but seemed eager to share his story nevertheless. ""Turning my head, I saw that a tank was aimed at me,"" he recalled. ""When a tank fires, there is no time between exit and arrival. It happens instantaneously. I saw a bright flash."" He fell three storeys when the tank fired. ""I realised I could either shout and be helped or die under this rubble,"" says Mr Stryzhko. ""Every cry was an extraordinary effort. After three to four screams, I heard the guys saying 'we are here, we'll help you'."" Mr Stryzhko's comrades saved his life and took him to a field hospital. ""There were around a dozen guys from different units,"" he remembered. He was not, however, out of danger. ""The doctors arrived and told us that in order to save our life we will be passed to the Russians."" Invading troops were taking more of Mariupol, and the soldier's best chance of getting medical attention was with the enemy. Meanwhile, in his hometown of Poltava, the church he has been involved with since childhood prayed for him. Like many Ukrainian institutions, the city's Assumption Cathedral has had to adapt to the war - boxes filled with humanitarian aid now fill its halls. ""I knew there were only two ways out of Mariupol: death or captivity,"" says the city's Archbishop Fedir, who still conducts services from the church's imposing alter. The Archbishop believed Mr Stryzhko wouldn't surrender, but had no idea whether he was dead or alive. That changed when the marine appeared with other Ukrainian prisoners on a social media post by Russian-backed separatists. ""I knew that God had performed a miracle,"" says the archbishop. ""He was in a difficult condition, with numerous fractures."" Mr Stryzhko had suffered a broken pelvis and jaw, and had lost vision in one eye. The archbishop was worried, but relieved to see Mr Stryzhko alive. ""God answered our prayers, and I was confident that we would be able to free him from captivity,"" he said. Archbishop Fedir says there are more marines from Poltava who went missing in Mariupol, which is now under Russian control after 80 days of siege. Back in Mr Stryzhko's stuffy hospital room, he recalled his treatment by the Russian side, or lack of it. ""Some nurses would bring food and feed me, as I could not sit and had my jaw broken,"" he says. ""The others would put the food down and say: 'Try and eat that, you Ukrainian low life!'"" Mr Stryzhko's injuries meant that he could not feed himself. ""The food stayed for several hours untouched. She came back asking if I was full and took it back. We were there without any anaesthetics. I believed I had to survive; it was all I could do."" These medical staff were Russian-supporting Ukrainians living in the occupied areas of Donbas. Mr Stryzhko says he didn't feel angry towards them. ""They lived under Russian propaganda for eight years, and the hatred I experienced was a result of this."" He remembers the Chechen fighters and Russian soldiers guarding them. The Chechens would come at night and taunt him running a knife along his body. ""Too bad it is forbidden to cut off your ear,"" they said, watched by the Russian soldiers. We haven't been able to independently verify the 26-year-old's claims. Mr Stryzhko was eventually taken to Russia and then flown to a military airfield in Russia-annexed Crimea, where he says he'll never forget what a Russian soldier told him, 17 days after his ordeal started. ""If you follow my orders, you will be in Ukraine this evening."" The marine was loaded onto an ambulance and taken towards Ukrainian territory. It turned out he was part of an agreed prisoner exchange between Ukraine and Russia. He was taken north to a hospital in Zaporizhzhia, which is under Ukrainian control, and then onto his home city of Poltava in the north. Mr Stryzhko described tears falling down his face when he realised he was back home. The soldier was one of a dozen Ukrainian troops returned, all marines from different units injured while defending the Illich steel works in Mariupol. ""Another driver approached and said: 'Calm down, you are in Ukraine now'."" ""I was very happy,"" he said. ""I could not even believe that I was in Ukraine, a place where you can breathe freely."" Despite the concerned look on his mother's face, he had no doubt what he wanted to do next. ""I am ready to continue my fight. It could be both at the frontline or somewhere else. I will help the army to bring victory over Russia closer."" He was then helped back into a horizontal position, straining, but smiling.

The EU-wide ban will affect oil that arrives by sea - around two-thirds of imports - but not pipeline oil, following opposition from Hungary. Poland and Germany have also pledged to end pipeline imports, meaning a total of 90% of Russian oil will be blocked. European Council chief Charles Michel said the deal cut off a huge source of financing for the Russian war machine. It is part of a sixth package of sanctions approved at a summit in Brussels, which all 27 member states have had to agree on. Russia currently supplies 27% of the EU's imported oil and 40% of its gas. The EU pays Russia around €400bn ($430bn, £341bn) a year in return. So far, no sanctions on Russian gas exports to the EU have been put in place, although plans to open a new gas pipeline from Russia to Germany have been frozen. The UK - which gets 8% of its oil needs from Russia - has pledged to phase out Russian oil by the end of the year. Oil prices climbed on news of the EU embargo, with Brent crude rising above $123 a barrel, its highest level since March. EU members spent hours struggling to resolve their differences over the ban on Russian oil imports. Hungary, which imports 65% of its oil from Russia through pipelines, was its main opponent. Hungary's Prime Minister, Viktor Orban, has good relations with Russian President Vladimir Putin. The compromise followed weeks of wrangling until it was agreed there would be ""a temporary exemption for oil that comes through pipelines to the EU"", Mr Michel told reporters. Because of this, the immediate sanctions will affect only Russian oil being transported into the EU over sea - two-thirds of the total imported from Russia. But in practice, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the scope of the ban would be wider, because Germany and Poland have volunteered to wind down their own pipeline imports by the end of this year. ""Left over is around 10-11% that is covered by the southern Druzhba,"" Ms Von der Leyen said, referring to the Russian pipeline supplying oil to Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic. The European Council would revisit this exemption ""as soon as possible"", she added. A senior EU official confirmed that the three landlocked countries were given an additional guarantee that they could obtain supplies of seaborne Russian oil in the event of an interruption to pipeline supply. The Russian ambassador to the EU, Vladimir Chizhov, said Brussels had ""already approached the limits of what is possible in terms of sanctions"". Speaking to Russian state TV, he predicted ""serious problems"" if the EU were to try to agree on a gas embargo. The ban on Russian oil imports was initially proposed by the European Commission - which develops laws for member states - a month ago. But resistance, notably from Hungary, held up the EU's troubled latest round of sanctions. Mr Orban declared the agreement a victory for his country, telling Hungarians they could sleep soundly - protected from expensive fuel costs that the embargo would bring to the rest of Europe. ""We succeeded in defeating the proposal of the European Council which would have forbidden Hungary from using Russian oil,"" he said in a Facebook video. Other landlocked countries, such as Slovakia and the Czech Republic, also asked for more time due to their dependence on Russian oil. Bulgaria, already cut off from Russian gas by Gazprom, had likewise sought opt-outs. The cost of living crisis being felt across Europe has not helped either. Sky-rocketing energy prices - among other things - have curtailed some EU countries' appetite for sanctions which could also hurt their own economies. The EU's oil agreement is a compromise deal - but it's also an important one. Moscow is heavily reliant on its energy exports, and the EU says this deal will cut more than 90% of Russian oil imports by the end of the year. But considering all the sabre-rattling and anti-Western rhetoric we've been hearing from Vladimir Putin in recent weeks, I suspect the Russian leader is more likely to say to Europe: ""Get ready for some more economic pain because of this embargo. Let's see how long your support for Ukraine lasts."" The Kremlin is aware of the differences of opinion within the EU over what to do about Russia - and you can be sure that Putin is going to try to exploit them. Russia will look for new markets, but in terms of oil that's not a quick fix. The infrastructure isn't in place to reorient oil exports from Europe to Asia, for example. And if it does sell to Asia - it will have to do so at a discounted price. There's also the question of Russian gas - an embargo on that could be discussed next. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky, who dialled into the summit, urged EU countries to stop their internal ""quarrels,"" stating that they only helped Moscow. ""All quarrels in Europe must end, internal disputes that only encourage Russia to put more and more pressure on you,"" Mr Zelensky said via video-link. Latvia's Prime Minister Krisjanis Karins said member countries should not get ""bogged down"" in their own personal interests. ""It's going to cost us more. But it's only money. The Ukrainians are paying with their lives,"" he said. Russia cut off gas supplies to Dutch firm GasTerra on Tuesday for refusing to pay for supplies in roubles. The EU has said paying in Russian currency breaches sanctions and Gazprom has already cut supplies to Poland, Finland and Bulgaria. "

Developed by British start-up company mOm, the incubators weigh only 44lbs (20kg) compared to traditional incubators which could weigh up to 220lbs (100kg), project leaders said. They could also be used immediately by clinicians, without lengthy set-up or training times, they added. Fifty-one incubators were going to hospitals across the country, with the first tranche being delivered on Tuesday, JOA said. The equipment is being overseen by international development not-for-profit organisation Crown Agents. It said the units could run off “multiple power sources, with a back-up battery, which will be vital as Ukraine continues to face power outages”. It said it had heard reports that the stress of the war was “having a negative effect on pregnant women with doctors seeing a sharp rise in premature births”. It added: “Incubators are vital for saving the lives of these premature babies, ensuring they remain at a safe, stable temperature."" Douglas Melville, of JOA, said the “robust and easy-to-use incubators will undoubtedly save innocent lives”. In March, prenatal clinics in both Kharkiv and Lviv told the BBC that the rate of preterm births had doubled or tripled, as a result of stress and medical issues linked to the war.  "
108,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-60125659,2022-05-31T11:35:56,What sanctions are being imposed on Russia over Ukraine invasion?," In its latest attempt to punish Russia for it invasion of Ukraine, the European Union is to ban all imports of oil from Russia that are brought in by sea. It says this could cut the amount of oil that EU countries import from Russia by up to 90%, reducing the amount of money the Russian government makes from oil sales. The EU, along with countries such as the UK and the US, have introduced a series of measures to weaken key areas of the Russian economy, such as its energy and financial sectors. Sanctions are penalties imposed by one country on another, to stop it acting aggressively, or breaking international law. They are among the toughest actions nations can take, short of going to war. Up until now, EU states have been importing 2.2 million barrels per day (bpd) of crude oil from Russia and 1.2 million bpd of oil products. Given the soaring price of oil, this has been earning Russia over $1m (£800,000) a day. EU nations have agreed to stop importing any oil from Russia that comes in by sea, which rules out about two-thirds of the total. They will continue, on a temporary basis, to import Russian oil by pipeline. This is to benefit countries such as Hungary and Slovakia, which are highly dependent on it. However, Germany and Poland, which also import Russian oil by pipeline, say they will stop doing so by the end of this year. The EU's president, Ursula von der Leyen, says this will effectively reduce the EU's oil imports from Russia to 10 or 11% of its current level. The US is banning all Russian oil and gas imports and the UK will phase out Russian oil imports by the end of 2022. Germany has frozen plans for the opening of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline from Russia. The EU has also said it will halt Russian coal imports by August. However, the EU is less keen to impose sanctions on Russian gas, because it relies on Russia for about 40% of its gas needs. In March, the EU committed to reducing gas imports by two-thirds within a year but has not been able to agree any further action. Western countries have introduced increasingly widespread sanctions - targeting wealthy individuals, banks, businesses and state-owned enterprises. Financial measures Russia's central bank assets have been frozen to stop it using its $630bn (£470bn) of foreign currency reserves. This caused the rouble to fall 22% in value, pushing up the price of imported goods and leading Russia's inflation rate to rise to 14%. The rouble has since recovered, mainly due to measures by Moscow to prop it up, but inflation has risen above 17%. The United States has barred Russia from making debt payments using the $600m it holds in US banks, making it harder for Russia to repay its international loans. Major Russian banks have been removed from the international financial messaging system Swift, which will delay payments to Russia for energy exports. The UK has excluded key Russian banks from the UK financial system, frozen the assets of all Russian banks, barred Russian firms from borrowing money, and placed limits on deposits Russians can make at UK banks, Targeting individuals The US, EU, UK and other countries have sanctioned more than 1,000 Russian individuals and businesses, including: The UK has also stopped the sale of ""golden visas"", which allowed wealthy Russians to get British residency rights. More than 1,000 international companies have either suspended trading in Russia, or withdrawn altogether - including McDonalds, Coca-Cola, Starbucks, and Marks & Spencer. McDonald's is leaving Russia and selling off its 850 restaurants, 30 years after setting up there. Food giant Nestle has withdrawn some of its brands including KitKat and Nesquik, but will still sell ""essential foods"". However, some brands including Burger King, and hotel groups Marriott and Accor say they can't pull out because their businesses operate under complex franchise deals. Military goods and mercenaries A ban on the export of dual-use goods - items with both a civilian and military purpose, such as vehicle parts - has been imposed by the UK, EU and US. The UK is also imposing sanctions on Russia's Wagner Group - a private military firm thought to function as an arms-length unit of the Russian military. Flights All Russian flights have been banned from US, UK, EU and Canadian airspace. The UK has also banned private jets chartered by Russians. Luxury goods The UK and the EU have banned the export of luxury goods to Russia - including vehicles, high-end fashion and art. The UK has also imposed a 35% tax on some imports from Russia, including vodka. Russia has banned exports of more than 200 products until the end of 2022, including telecoms, medical, vehicle, agricultural, electrical equipment and timber. In addition, it is blocking interest payments to foreign investors who hold government bonds, and banning Russian firms from paying overseas shareholders. And it has stopped foreign investors who hold billions of dollars worth of Russian stocks and bonds from selling them. "

Brent crude rose above $123 a barrel on Tuesday, the highest it has been for two months. Prices for oil and gas have soared in recent months, fuelled by the lifting of lockdowns and the Ukraine war. Rising energy costs are putting pressure on consumers, making it more expensive to heat homes and drive. Petrol hit a new record of 173.02p a litre on Monday, according to the AA. At the same time, the average price of diesel in the UK rose to 182.58p a litre, it said. Filling a typical 55-litre tank of a diesel now costs more than £100. The war in Ukraine has pushed countries in the West to shun Russian energy supplies. Russia currently supplies 27% of the EU's imported oil and 40% of its gas. The EU pays Russia around €400bn (£341bn) a year in return. The ban agreed by EU leaders will see an immediate ban on Russian oil being transported into the bloc by sea. Two-thirds of Russian oil arrives by sea. However, the deal, which followed weeks of wrangling, includes a temporary exemption for pipeline oil following opposition from Hungary. Pledges by Poland and Germany to stop importing pipeline oil by the end of this year will raise coverage of the ban to 90% of Russian imports. Brent crude, the global benchmark for oil prices, has risen more than 70% over the past year. Oil prices climbed again on news of the EU embargo, with Brent crude reaching its highest level since March. Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, said confirmation that the EU will cut its purchases of Russian oil by the end of 2022 is pushing up prices because European countries now need to find alternative sources of supply. ""It is not feasible to replace that amount of energy with other fuel sources, such as wind, solar, biomass or nuclear, in such a short space of time, so the EU needs to find oil and gas from somewhere,"" Mr Mould said. ""This will not be easy because existing global output may well be on contract already, so competition for what is not on contract will now be hotter."" Sophie Lund-Yates, lead equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said the upwards trajectory of oil prices may continue until Western countries outline clearly how supply is going to be sourced. ""It's possible this could get tougher before it gets better,"" she said. ""We know that rising energy costs are a particular challenge for households which already have severe pressure on their incomes, but smaller businesses shouldn't be left out of the equation either - this is a tough time to be heating offices, and at a time when it's meant to be about rebuilding resilience after the pandemic."" European Council chief Charles Michel said the deal cut off ""a huge source of financing"" for the Russian war machine. It is part of a sixth package of sanctions approved at a summit in Brussels, which all 27 member states have had to agree on. So far, no sanctions on Russian gas exports to the EU have been put in place, although plans to open a new gas pipeline from Russia to Germany have been frozen.

In an interview to be aired on BBC Radio 4's File on 4 later, Prof Hayward said it was important to hear ""both sides"" when it comes to the war in Ukraine. Prof Hayward's lecture concerned an attack in the Damascus suburb of Douma in 2018, which medics said killed 40 people. A year later, the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons said there were reasonable grounds to believe chlorine gas had been used. Prof Hayward told students: ""One narrative says the White Helmets helped rescue victims, provided evidence and gave witness statements about the chemical attack on Douma on 7 April 2018. ""The critics say the White Helmets were responsible for staging a false flag event to spur the West to attack the Syrian government. In fact, dispute about this case is still current."" It's an argument put forward by members of a collective of academics and bloggers he is in - the Working Group on Syria Propaganda and the Media (WGSPM). Mariangela said she came away from the lecture thinking it ""could be true"" that the attack was faked, until she spoke to a Syrian friend. ""He [Prof Hayward] essentially frames it as... 'the Working Group is saying the truth, and they're not listening to us',"" she said. Prof Hayward told the BBC his course asks whether a claim simply should be accepted on the basis of someone's authority. It's clear to his students that this also applies to their teacher's words, he added. He said he does not teach about Syria, but simply used an example in his class that he was familiar with. Kvitka Perehinets, a Ukrainian student at the University of Edinburgh, has been anxiously following the war in her home country from a distance. Most of her family are there - some of them fighting - and she told the BBC she was distressed by Prof Hayward's recent tweets. Days after a maternity hospital in Mariupol was bombed, Prof Hayward retweeted a Russian representative to the UN describing the attack as #fakenews. The tweet said the hospital had been controlled by the Ukrainian military, and no patients were there. While one of Mariupol's maternity hospitals was no longer operational, the facility that had been bombed was a different one altogether - and did contain patients. On learning this, Prof Hayward updated his Twitter thread. Asked by the BBC about the thread, he said: ""I stand by the statement that I appended to that tweet, which is that we should strive to hear both sides."" He also suggested it was ""uncertain"" whether the maternity hospital was bombed by aircraft. ""Acquiring knowledge involves investigation, research and reasoning,"" he added. ""If that's always going to be dismissed as disinformation, I think it's a very dangerous line to go down."" But Kvitka said ""there are no two sides"" to the conflict. ""The moment we start to sort of equate the two sides in the story is the moment we lose our humanity,"" she said. ""The oppressor - in this case, Russia - should not be given the same kind of platform as those who are being oppressed."" Kvitka said she alerted the university to Prof Hayward's tweets, but received no reply. Dr Nader Hashemi, director of the Centre for Middle East Studies at the University of Denver and a visiting scholar at the University of Cambridge, told the BBC he was ""horrified"" by the content about Syria in Prof Hayward's lecture. ""He couches his lecture in the language of global justice and citizenship, purporting to be objective,"" he said. ""He's really engaged in, I think, a deeply distorted set of teachings."" The University of Edinburgh says its programmes are approved by a board of studies. It says it is committed to ""academic freedom"" but that it takes ""a strong view… against the spread of misinformation"" and encourages students to report concerns. The university and Prof Hayward have always maintained that his tweets and involvement with the WGSPM are separate from his academic work. In England, the Office for Students (OfS) regulates universities by, for example, monitoring student complaints. But there is no direct equivalent to the OfS in Scotland. Jamie Hepburn, Scotland's minister for Higher and Further Education, told the BBC that ""attempts by anyone to repeat"" Russian disinformation about Ukraine were ""unacceptable"" - but that universities ""are solely responsible for internal institutional matters such as the conduct of their staff"". The Department for Education (DfE), which is responsible for education in England, said it expected ""universities' due diligence processes to consider the reputational, ethical and security risks of false and dangerous narratives, and ensure that students are not misled by views that are clearly false"". When academics' tweets were raised in the Commons, Mr Zahawi said the minister for Higher and Further Education, Michelle Donelan, was ""contacting those universities"". A Freedom of Information request found that Ms Donelan raised the issue in a meeting of the Higher Education taskforce. But the BBC understands that no individual universities have been contacted. Academics sharing misinformation about the war in Ukraine are useful to Russia, said James Roscoe, UK ambassador to the UN. They add a veneer of respectability to the state's narrative, he told the BBC. ""Russian diplomats can then retweet them or the Russian state media retweets them,"" Mr Roscoe added. The BBC has also spoken to Dr Justin Schlosberg, who specialises in media and journalism at Birkbeck, University of London. He has been criticised for retweeting Russian state media questioning what happened in the Ukrainian city of Bucha. Since Russian forces were pushed back from Kyiv at the end of March, the bodies of more than 1,000 civilians have been discovered in the Bucha region. Photographs, footage and satellite images have shown bodies lying in the street. Dr Schlosberg retweeted a video of Bucha's mayor speaking without mentioning a massacre. Russian media has been using the video to bolster the idea that the bodies appeared after the Russians had left the city. Asked by the BBC what he thought happened in Bucha, Dr Schlosberg said: ""I have no idea. My only understanding is that I think no-one else really knows what happened. I think there is a very strong likelihood that there were very serious atrocities, almost certainly the vast majority of which were committed by Russia."" Dr Schlosberg said he was also ""concerned about disinformation that can sometimes come from Western governments"". He added that the criticism on Twitter resembles ""authoritarianism"", and likened it to 1950s McCarthyism in the US, when Communists or suspected Communists were accused of trying to overthrow the government. Birkbeck, University of London, said it ""does not have any evidence that Dr Schlosberg has guided students or shared information in ways that are in breach of its Freedom of Speech policy"" and that it was committed to free debate. Last month, Ms Donelan said new legislation in England would ""put a duty on universities to promote free speech and academic freedom, not just protect it"". Dr Hashemi said academics who share Russian misinformation may be a dangerous influence on young people. But asked whether they should be prevented from presenting personal views in lectures, he said any curbs on academic freedom would be a ""disaster"". ""We should not get into the business of deep censorship on university campuses,"" he added. You can listen to the File on 4 episode at 20:00 BST on Tuesday 31 May on BBC Radio 4 or BBC Sounds. "
113,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-61634336,2022-05-30T23:01:16,Primark executive regrets this autumn's price rises," A Primark executive has told the BBC he ""regrets"" raising prices, as the fashion firm battles with rising costs. John Bason, finance director at Primark's parent company Associated British Foods, also warned some people might spend less as budgets are squeezed by the higher living costs. Primark is hiking prices across some of its range from this autumn. But Mr Bason said the company is still committed to ""affordability for everyone"". Across the UK economy, firms have been passing on higher energy, shipping and oil costs to customers. High Street chains including Next, Greggs and Superdry have all said they are raising prices. Primark had promised not to raise prices for its spring and summer collection. But while it is keeping that pledge, ABF recently announced that it will implement ""selective price increases"" across some of Primark's autumn and winter stock as it tackles spiralling costs. ""I do regret that we have to put some prices up,"" Mr Bason said. ""It is a reflection of the scale of the inflation that we're seeing."" Inflation - the rate at which prices rise - is at a 40-year-high. The pandemic, the supply chain disruption as the global economy rebounded, and the war in Ukraine have all impacted on rising prices. ""Obviously Russia's invasion of Ukraine has really changed the economic environment and inflation in particular,"" Mr Bason said. ""We've worked hard to ensure that our prices stay where they are, but at some point the inflationary pressures is such that you do have to do something about it."" Mr Bason would not say how much prices will go up. However, he insisted that Primark was still ""the best value clothing fashion retailer"" in the UK. And said that, in an environment where other retailers were also raising prices, the gap - compared with others - could be maintained. Retail expert Jonathan de Mello said tightening household budgets due to the rising costs of food, fuel and energy are a huge problem for high street retailers. ""The cost of living crisis has achieved the dubious accolade of replacing Covid as the main concern for consumers currently, and as real incomes start to fall and prices rise further, retailers face yet another major headwind,"" he said. Mr de Mello added: ""These price increases will certainly impact less affluent consumers buying from Primark, who have already seen real incomes fall due to a combination of significantly higher energy prices, and food price inflation."" Mr Bason said: ""There are some consumers who would normally be spending more and probably would come into Primark, and I think there would be those that have very, very constrained budgets and probably would shop less with us as a result of this."" So far, however, Mr Bason said Primark is not seeing ""any major impact"" from the tightening of budgets. ""The footfall and the like-for-like sales that we're seeing in the UK have been on a strongly improving trend this year and that really is more about recovery from the pandemic,"" he said. ""People are travelling, people are going back to the office although probably not back to where it was, and people are socialising. So we're seeing a big pick up in sales relating to those activities."" Unlike most High Street retailers, Primark does not sell its products online. As a result, the business was hit hard by Covid restrictions while stores were closed. The group has recently revamped its website to give more details of in-store ranges, so customers can browse the full collection and check availability before coming into stores. But Mr Bason said he is confident that the high street does have a future. ""Even though we were closed probably six months for the two main years of the pandemic, our customers have come back to us. That I think is very very striking,"" he added. ""So no, I think the demise of the high street is way overstated, but it is changing. There's no doubt over it."" Mr Bason is also confident that fast fashion can be green, with the chain announcing new sustainability pledges last year. The pledges included a commitment to making Primark's clothes using recycled or ""more sustainably sourced materials"" by 2030. Mr Bason said that the soaring energy prices, fuelled by the Ukraine war, could act as a catalyst to greater energy efficiency as suppliers look to reduce their costs. "

But the longer the conflict goes on, the more signs there are of divisions. European Union countries are struggling to impose a future ban on Russian oil imports, with Hungary the principal opponent. Hungary is a major importer of Russian oil. With Hungary facing a cost-of-living crisis, it said the sanction would amount to an ""atomic bomb"" dropped on Hungary's economy. Its President, Victor Orban, is also a long-term ally of Putin. The proposed measure is part of a sixth package of sanctions being discussed by the bloc at its summit in Brussels, and requires the agreement of all 27 member states. Addressing the summit, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky urged the assembled leaders to end internal rows. ""It is time for you to be not separate, not fragments, but one whole,"" he said. Meanwhile on the ground in Donbas, fierce fighting has been continuing in the city of Severodonetsk with Russian forces pushing towards its centre. Local administration head Roman Vlasenko said the enemy had entered from two directions but that Ukrainian forces were holding their ground. If Russian forces take the city, they will almost have completed their conquest of the Luhansk Region - a major strategic aim. Much of the fighting in Ukraine this week is focused on the city of Severodonetsk, in the eastern Donbas region. The BBC's Quentin Somerville has been watching that fight play out on the horizon from a city just a few miles away across the river. ""Shells were landing every minute on its length and breath. Severodonetsk was burning,"" he writes in his latest piece from the front lines. ""Here, Russia isn't fighting a campaign of attrition, it's waging a war of oblivion. And, for the moment on this front, it is winning."" One young Ukrainian soldier has been describing to the BBC's Jeremy Bowen his experience of fighting in the front line in Donbas. Maxsym Lutsyk looks older and more serious, and makes fewer jokes than when he first met him in the early days of the invasion, our correspondent says. For three weeks, Maxsym and his comrades had fought to keep control of a position they called Serber, after a small dog they had adopted. It was in a smashed-up former factory in Rubizhne, a town that eventually fell to the Russians. ""It was like hell. There were no good positions to defend. We had been in trenches, sometimes shelters from Soviet times, and a fire station."" His unit was targeted by tank fire about 25 times a day, he says, and one of his friends was killed there. A French journalist has been killed in Luhansk region when an armoured evacuation vehicle he was travelling in was hit by Russian shelling. Local officials posted graphic images showing a badly damaged lorry with a smashed windscreen and blood on the interior. Officials say the journalist suffered a fatal neck wound after shrapnel pierced the vehicle's armour. Later, French President Emmanuel Macron named the man as Frédéric Leclerc-Imhoff, aged 32. The Luhansk military administration head, Serhiy Haidai, said the incident had prompted the suspension of civilian evacuations in the region. Russia has always denied deliberately targeting civilians in the conflict. Is President Putin well? Yes, says Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, who has denied speculation that President Vladimir Putin is ill. There have been unconfirmed rumours that Mr Putin, who turns 70 this year, may be suffering from ill health, possibly cancer. In an interview with French TV, Mr Lavrov said the Russian leader appears in public every day, and no sane person would see any signs of an ailment. ""You can watch him on screens, read and listen to his speeches,"" Mr Lavrov said in comments released by the Russian foreign ministry. ""I leave it to the conscience of those who spread such rumours despite daily opportunities to assess how anyone is looking."" One of Ukraine's main concerns over its efforts to defend Donbas has been its lack of heavy weaponry. As the BBC's Laurence Peter reports, the US government appears close to sending a long-range multiple-rocket system (MLRS) to Ukraine. Kyiv's forces are already using US-delivered M777 howitzers, which have a range of about 25km (16 miles). But the MLRS would allow Ukraine to reach targets much further away than that. However, President Joe Biden appeared on Monday to dampen the speculation, saying that Ukraine would not be sent rockets ""that can strike into Russia"". There are concerns that by offering Ukraine the most advanced munitions to be fired from an MLRS battery, able to hit targets up to 300km (186 miles) away, the US would risk direct conflict with Moscow. Ukraine's Eurovision Song Contest winner, the Kalush Orchestra, will be given a new trophy after the original was auctioned off, according to Ukrainian media reports. The crystal microphone's manufacturer Kosta Boda said it wanted to support the group. The Kalush Orchestra announced late on Sunday it had raised $900,000 (£712,000) in the auction on Facebook aimed at buying drones for Ukraine's military. The sale coincided with the band's appearance at a charity concert at Berlin's Brandenburg Gate. "

The woman, who does not want her name to be released, claims she was falsely accused of exploiting the refugees. But hundreds of pounds of her own money were spent on food and gifts and she even funded their flights, she said. She wants more to be done to make the Homes for Ukraine scheme work better. The refugee had fled Bucha, north of Kyiv, and came to north-east England on 16 April. The 45-year-old later claimed that her hosts asked for money and she was then told to leave within three weeks. She said she and her 13-year-old son were ""left homeless"" and ended up having to be helped by a Sunderland-based charity to find temporary accommodation. However, the family who opened their home to them said they did everything to make them welcome, spending hundreds of pounds to ""distract them from the horrors they had gone through"". The woman said: ""We paid for their flights here and picked them up from the airport. ""We spent hundreds of pounds of our own money on them - I wanted to distract them from the horrors they had gone through."" Although they had not received any government money they did not mind and spent £700 on food, they said. Friends and neighbours donated clothes, cash and vouchers. ""We collected £800 to buy a laptop and a bike for the boy,"" she said. ""I bought him expensive trainers for his birthday and got my friends and family to send them cards to make the day special."" The charity supporting the Ukrainian woman said she stands by her claims about how she became homeless and is now looking for longer term accommodation for herself and her son. The North East family said they did ask their guests to leave because they had accused them of exploitation, which left them ""hurt and horrified"". ""Anyone who knows me knows it couldn't be further from the truth,"" the woman said. ""I was really upset and it will stop me doing anything like this ever again. ""We opened our homes and our hearts up and it ended dreadfully."" The family said they did not get enough support and believe some Ukrainian refugees did not fully understand what they were entitled to under the government scheme. Both the local police force and relevant council have confirmed there was no wrongdoing involving the family. The government said Homes for Ukraine had helped more than 33,000 people, with very few unsuccessful cases. Follow BBC North East & Cumbria on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.

Frédéric Leclerc-Imhoff, 32, was covering an evacuation operation for broadcaster BFMTV when he died. Officials say he suffered a fatal wound to the neck after shrapnel pierced the armoured vehicle he was travelling in. His colleague Maxime Brandstaetter was also injured, report say. It was Mr Leclerc-Imhoff's second trip to Ukraine to cover the war. He had been working for BFMTV for six years. Paying tribute to him online, BFMTV wrote: ""This tragic event reminds us of the dangers faced by all journalists who have been reporting this conflict at the risk of their lives for more than three months now."" BBC correspondent James Waterhouse says graphic images of what appears to be the aftermath have been circulated online, showing a badly-damaged lorry with a smashed windscreen and blood on the interior. Another person travelling with Mr Leclerc-Imhoff, a local Ukrainian journalist, was not injured. On Twitter, French President Emmanuel Macron paid tribute to Mr Leclerc-Imhoff and other journalists reporting on the frontline from warzones, saying: ""I would like to reiterate France's unconditional support"". ""Journalist Frédéric Leclerc-Imhoff was in Ukraine to show the reality of the war. On board a humanitarian bus, alongside civilians forced to flee to escape Russian bombs, he was fatally shot."" Meanwhile France's foreign ministry said it demands a ""transparent investigation"" as soon as possible to find out what happened. In March, US journalist Brent Renaud became the first foreign journalist to be killed covering the war in Ukraine. "
117,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-61627316,2022-05-30T17:20:41,Ukraine may soon get US long-range MLRS rocket system," The US government appears close to sending a long-range multiple-rocket system (MLRS) to Ukraine. Russia sees such deliveries of heavy weapons as a provocative escalation. President Volodymyr Zelensky and other Ukrainian officials have urged delivery of the MLRS to counter Russia's heavy bombardments in the eastern Donbas region. But President Joe Biden said the US would not send Ukraine rocket systems ""that can strike into Russia"". There are concerns that such action would risk drawing the US and its Nato allies into direct conflict with Moscow. Moscow has welcomed President Biden's decision not to send weapons to Ukraine that could reach deep inside Russia. Russia continues to pound Severodonetsk and other parts of Donbas with rockets, tanks and air strikes. Kyiv's forces are already using US-delivered M777 howitzers, which have a range of about 25km (16 miles). But the MLRS would allow Ukraine to reach targets much further away than that. An M270 MLRS battery can fire a range of munitions, with the most advanced able to hit targets up to 300km (186 miles) away. However, it can also fire shorter-range rockets with a range of around 70km (43 miles). Limiting Ukraine to the smaller rockets could be a way for the US to avoid escalating the conflict, while still significantly improving Ukraine's arsenal. A senior US official quoted by the Washington Post said the White House was comfortable with giving Ukraine the MLRS, but would withhold the longest range weapons compatible with the system. The UK also has the MLRS. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said Ukraine should get the rockets ""to defend themselves against this very brutal Russian artillery"", but he did not say the UK would supply them. The US used the MLRS to destroy major Iraqi targets in the 1990-91 Gulf War and in 2003. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has accused the West of ""pumping up the Ukrainian nationalists with weapons"". He said the West was ""waging a proxy war"" against Russia which, he warned, would mean ""inevitable escalation"". Last week, a presenter on Russian state TV said the US would be crossing a ""red line"" by supplying the MLRS to Ukraine, and it would be seen as an attempt to ""provoke a very harsh response from Russia"". In an extra move to defend Ukraine's key Black Sea port - Odesa - Denmark has supplied Harpoon anti-ship cruise missiles, with a range of about 130km (70 nautical miles). Ukraine can deploy them alongside its own Neptune missiles, credited with having sunk Russia's flagship cruiser Moskva last month. Russian long-range missiles have struck railway facilities, oil depots and other infrastructure in western Ukraine - seen partly as an effort to thwart Western arms deliveries. Meanwhile, Russia is reported to have fired its latest multiple-rocket system against Ukrainian targets in the Kharkiv area - a weapon described as a giant flamethrower. Its use was reported by Tass news agency, quoting a Russian security official. The TOS-2 Tosochka is a thermobaric fuel-air weapon: it creates a massive explosion by igniting a gas cloud on impact, depriving anyone in the area of oxygen. Russia has also inflicted heavy damage on Ukrainian cities using long-range cruise missiles, some fired from warships. "
118,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-61634050,2022-05-30T16:18:21,'I watched from afar Russia’s latest merciless assault on Severodonetsk'," Russian forces have entered the city of Severodonetsk, as they continue their attempts to capture the eastern Donbas region of Ukraine. One of the region's governors says that the bombardment of the industrial centre is so intense that they have given up counting the casualties. Just days ago, I watched from a rooftop in Lysychansk as, on the horizon, its twin city of Severodonetsk was being bombed indiscriminately. Shells were landing every minute on its length and breath. Severodonetsk was burning. Lysychansk itself has been drained of life. A few people still go out on the streets, but they are mostly deserted. Artillery fire is a regular threat. The air carried on the summer breeze is gritty with dust from smoke and pulverised buildings. Having failed to conquer all of Ukraine, Russian forces are now targeting Donbas - made up of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. If Severodonetsk and Lysychansk fall, the whole of Luhansk would be occupied. Here, Russia isn't fighting a campaign of attrition, it's waging a war of oblivion. And, for the moment on this front, it is winning. Serhiy Haidai, the governor of Luhansk, now says that all critical infrastructure in Severodonetsk has been destroyed. Previously, he suggested that Ukrainian forces may have to withdraw from the city and Lysychansk. The scene of devastation in a third city, Rubizhne - in peacetime just a short drive to the north - shows what Russia's unrelenting artillery fire is capable of. Looking from Lysychansk into the distance, there is now a blot on the emerald green landscape. The small city is gone - scoured from the earth. The way it fell some two weeks ago, marks an important shift in how Vladimir Putin's forces are now fighting the war. Gone are long armoured columns and tank and infantry attacks seen in the first months, in favour of large-scale artillery barrages - as many as 1500 shells a day in Rubizhne - to wipe out resistance before any ground advance. Overwhelming Russian firepower - particularly artillery - underlines the urgent need, say Ukrainian field commanders, for more advanced weapons from the West to halt the enemy advance. The great sweep of Donbas runs along Ukraine's eastern flank from Severodonetsk in the north, ending at the southern coast around the city of Mariupol - the hard-fought over city recently captured by Russia in one of its biggest gains in the war. President Volodymyr Zelensky said last week that Ukraine was losing 50-100 troops a day in the region. In Lysychansk, I meet private first class, Vladimir, serving with a reconnaissance unit in the country's National Guard. Russian forces are adapting, he says, first they came in ""bold and got hit hard"", now the enemy flattens what it can't capture with infantry. He tells me of his month in Rubizhne. ""It wasn't Mariupol, but it was pretty close. It was very hard. There were a lot of losses - a lot of fighting across streets. There was also artillery, just removing those houses very fast. People were trying to hide in the basement so they had no view, no assessment of the current situation. So there were a lot of losses during that time."" The men and women fighting in Donbas for Ukraine are not inexperienced. Many have fought against Russian-backed separatists who, since 2014, have been trying to secede from Ukraine. But, in this new battle for the region, they face a national army - one that has large resources of men and equipment. Even for experienced fighters, the volume and nature of Russian weaponry being used in Donbas is overwhelming. I speak to another guardsman who doesn't want to give his name. ""It's not my first war,"" he says, ""I mean that one was a trench warfare, so it's a bit different [this time]. When I went to Rubizhne I saw the whole picture. It was tough. Shots with high-explosive fragmentation grenades, 82 mm calibre weapons,"" he says, stopping to draw on a cigarette. Vladimir - the Ukrainian soldier - says the local population are ""30% pro-Ukrainian, 30% pro-Russian and 40% don't care"". Of course, many pro-Ukrainian residents have now fled. More from Quentin Sommerville on the front line: Since the start of the war, military analysts have made much of Russia's rising casualty numbers and the weakness of morale among its soldiers. Casualty numbers are still rising, but Russia isn't running out of men in Donbas. Nor is the Kremlin running short of artillery shells. The explosives which are hammering Lysychansk and Severodonetsk seem in plentiful supply. The surrounding countryside too is marked like a pox with black artillery craters spreading for miles along fields and roadways. ""There's a lot of artillery,"" says Vladimir. ""Bombardments are like a nightmare, we shoot one round, they shoot 10. When our sniper is shooting, they send in a full packet of Grads on his position. So it's basically a sniper with one bullet and they send like $1,000 of artillery rounds. They really don't care how much ammunition they use."" Like Vladimir, many of the men I met in Lysychansk were previously the defenders of Rubizhne. Having been through hell once, they say they prepared to endure it a second time. Footage given to the BBC by a unit of the National Guard shows a landscape there which could be a recreation of World War Two devastation - lines of shelled-out houses, empty streets with only corpses and dead animals along the pathways. And there's another reminder too from that war - shellshock. Men left the town with shaking hands and limbs - and constant headaches. ""Cigarettes and coffee are all that keep them away,"" said one young lieutenant called Pasha. On the outskirts of Lysychansk, bigger guns have arrived on the Ukrainian front line. Another unit of the National Guard are working on an M777 howitzer, newly received from the Australian government. It has two kangaroos painted on the barrel. The gun is welcome but, as almost everyone I meet tells me, they need more. They specifically asked for longer range weapons. The US has agreed to send them far more powerful multiple launch rocket systems. They could be a game-changer in Donbas, if they arrive in time. Some Western commentators believe Ukraine should submit to end the destruction and cede its territory. But, for the weary Ukrainian defenders facing the Russian onslaught, that is unthinkable. In fact, the losses they have suffered have only galvanised their belief that the enemy must be stopped and pushed back. Vladimir Putin gambled big - and lost - on taking all of Ukraine, so perhaps that explains the enormous resources he is throwing at achieving a tactical win in Donbas. But a Kremlin victory here won't mean defeat for Ukraine. I ask the unnamed guardsman, tired after months of battle, but still here at front, what it will take to win? ""There is a sky, and the sky is ours. Drones are helping a lot. Weapons have arrived and multiple rocket launchers. America, lend-lease…"" he tells me. ""The only question is time. It's time and that's it. And then everything will be Ukraine."" Follow Quentin on Twitter @sommervilletv © 2022 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.

The discussions form part of contingency plans being exploring ahead of winter amid the war in Ukraine. Centrica's facility in Yorkshire was mothballed in 2017 when the government refused to subsidise it. The BBC understands the government may now be prepared to contribute to re-establishing a strategic gas reserve. The talks are part of plans for a ""reasonable worst case scenario"" in which Russia shuts off all gas supplies to Europe resulting in Norwegian gas supplies being redirected from the UK to Europe. Those plans also include extending the life of the few remaining coal fired power plants in the UK. Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng wrote to the owners EDF, Drax and Uniper in April and on Friday of last week instructed National Grid's Electricity System Operator to explore what would be needed to extend production. The government has also been in touch with EDF to see what scope was available to extend the life of Hinkley Point B, a nuclear plant in Somerset. The UK gets a very small amount from natural gas from Russia but is reliant on Norway for a third of supplies. There are concerns that if Russia cuts off supplies to the European Union or the bloc boycotts supplies because of the Kremlin's attack on Ukraine, Norwegian supplies might be diverted. The EU relies on Russia for 40% of its gas supplies. The UK also imports liquified natural gas (LNG) from Qatar and the US. There has been a glut of liquefied natural gas arriving in the UK in recent weeks as suppliers use the UK's terminals as a hub for deliveries to Europe. Tankers have been turned away as there is nowhere to store it. At full capacity, Centrica's facility in Rough, Yorkshire can store between 10 and 12 days' worth of the UK's gas needs. Industry experts say that if they started work now, it might be able to hold up to six days' worth of the UK gas demand by this winter. It was shut five years ago when Centrica told the government that the £2bn-£3bn worth of investment needed to extend its life made no economic sense to a private company. At the time, the government declined to subsidise the facility telling Centrica ""if the market doesn't think it makes sense - neither does the government"", according to a company insider. Government sources indicated that there was a low probability that Russia would cut off all gas supplies to the EU or Norway would divert supplies from the UK. They pointed out that many Norwegian gas sources are directly connected to the UK and could not be diverted. Another power source could be the Hinkley Point B nuclear plant which has already had its life extended from an original decommissioning date of 2011 and was due to come off line in July of this year. An EDF insider told the BBC it would not be without cost and the timing was very tight. ""Extending anything costs more in terms of investment, just like deciding to get your car through the next MOT but nuclear has the added safety case dimension,"" he said. ""So it is not necessarily easy and given the closure date is July 2022, that's very soon to change direction when they are planning on closing in a few weeks."" The BBC understands there has been no formal request to EDF from the government which is waiting for evidence on the business case and the safety implications of such an extension. A spokesperson for The Office for Nuclear Regulation (ONR) said: ""Any extension to the operating life of a nuclear power station would need a robust safety case produced by the operator to demonstrate that the plant is safe to run for any extended period. ""This evidence would then be thoroughly assessed by a team of expert ONR inspectors."" Talking to Times Radio, government minister Chris Philp described the contingency plans as ""a sensible precautionary measure given that the gas supply coming out of Russia and Ukraine is, for obvious reasons, so heavily disrupted and we do, of course, use quite a lot of gas to generate electricity."" He added: ""A lot of ours comes from Norway and in the form of liquified natural gas, but of course disruption to the global gas market will have a ""knock on effect"" on the UK."" "

In an interview with French TV, Mr Lavrov said the Russian leader appears in public every day, and no sane person would see any signs of an ailment. There has been increasing unconfirmed media speculation that Mr Putin, who turns 70 this year, may be suffering from ill health, possibly cancer. The interview came as Russia continues its advance in Ukraine's Donbas region. Mr Lavrov said the ""liberation"" of the eastern region was an ""unconditional priority"" for Russia. He repeated the Kremlin's widely discredited line that Russia is fighting a ""neo-Nazi regime"". Noting that President Putin regularly appeared in public, Mr Lavrov told TF1: ""I don't think that sane people can see in this person signs of some kind of illness or ailment."" ""You can watch him on screens, read and listen to his speeches,"" he said in comments released by the Russian foreign ministry. ""I leave it to the conscience of those who spread such rumours despite daily opportunities to assess how anyone is looking."" British intelligence sources were quoted telling media outlets that Mr Putin was seriously ill in the last week. However, rumours about the condition of the Russian leader, long known for his healthy lifestyle and love of sport, have surfaced periodically for years. Western intelligence agencies have been taking a close interest in President Putin's health, both mental and physical. This is not just because he gave the order to launch the ill-planned invasion of Ukraine, it's also due to the fact that he has almost sole authority over the use of Russia's vast nuclear arsenal. They need to know if he is about to launch an impetuous tactical nuclear strike in Ukraine that would shatter the 77-year long absence of these weapons being used in war. Is he mad? No. He is in full control of his faculties. But he has grown steadily angrier with the West. Two years of Covid-inspired isolation have reinforced Putin's paranoia that everything the West and Nato does is to the detriment of Russia. But speculation in the western media that he has serious health problems veer - so far - more towards wishful thinking than anything backed up by hard medical evidence. Asked about the human cost of the fighting, which has seen devastating artillery and rocket attacks on some urban areas, Mr Lavrov insisted Russian soldiers were ""under strict orders categorically to avoid attacks and strikes on civilian infrastructure"". Since Russia invaded on 24 February, at least 4,031 civilians have been killed and 4,735 injured, according to the UN, and an unknown number of combatants have died or been wounded. More than 14 million people have fled their homes, with towns and cities reduced to rubble. The fighting is now focused on the Donbas - the mining belt made up of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. Separatists in the two regions, which historically have strong ties to Russia, broke away in 2014 and are now fighting alongside Russian troops to take full control. Mr Lavrov told TF1 that winning in ""the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, recognised by the Russian Federation as independent states, is an unconditional priority"". However, he added, it was up to the rest of Ukraine if people there were ""happy to return to the authority of a neo-Nazi regime that has proven it is Russophobic in essence"". Russia has already been forced to pull back from an attempt to overrun the capital Kyiv, after been repelled by Ukrainian forces. They have also been pushed back from the second city, Kharkiv, in recent weeks, with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky making a morale-boosting trip to the battle scarred city on Sunday. Speaking in the city, he said his soldiers would defend their land ""to the last man"". ""They [the Russians] have no chance,"" he said. ""We will fight and we will definitely win."" "

Hanna and her husband Mikola, who are now staying in Newbury in Berkshire, lived with their two young children in Chernihiv in northern Ukraine. The couple said those who survived the Russian bombardment are in desperate need of generators and windows. And their Homes for Ukraine hosts have helped them arrange the transportation. Margo Payne said: ""The people left in the villages around Chernihiv are mainly the elderly and infirm who were unable to travel. ""Those whose homes have not been completely destroyed have either the shell of a home or a house with no doors or windows. ""They have no electricity so we want to get generators to these villages so at least some of them can get power some of the time."" Ms Payne urged people to donate old or new generators, windows, small solar panels to charge phones as well as sleeping bags and tents. The former mayor of Newbury and her husband John have arranged for the larger items to be stored in a local farmer's barn before everything is transported via lorry to Poland's border with Ukraine in July.

123,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-61624557,2022-05-30T05:01:36,Ukraine war student-turned-soldier: 'Friends die in your arms'," Maxsym Lutsyk looks older and more serious, and makes fewer jokes, than when I saw him in the days after Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Back then, the 19-year-old had just put university on hold and volunteered to fight. Last week he made a difficult journey out of the Donbas front line, using back roads at night to avoid artillery fire, to pick up supplies for his unit and to tell me what it has been like fighting the Russians. We met in Bakhmut, a small town well within the range of Russian artillery. Some of its buildings are in ruins and the city has been almost emptied of civilians. For three weeks, Maxsym and his comrades had fought to keep control of a position they called Serber, after a small dog they had adopted. It was in a smashed-up former factory in Rubizhne, a town that eventually fell to the Russians. ""It was like hell. There were no good positions to defend. We had been in trenches, sometimes shelters from Soviet times, and a fire station."" His unit was targeted by tank fire about 25 times a day, he says. ""One of my friends was killed there and maybe 10 or 15 guys were injured seriously."" Now, summer is almost on them and Ukraine's fertile black soil is bursting with life, the deadliest fighting is in Donbas. Russia's generals are learning from its enemy's victories around Kyiv, the capital, and Kharkiv, the second city. Defeat in March led the Russian army to fall back, in April and May, on what it knows best. Its forces and fearsome firepower are concentrated in a narrow sector of east Ukraine. Now it is close to forcing Ukrainian forces out of Luhansk, one of the two regions that make up Donbas. The other, Donetsk, where Ukraine has a bigger footprint, is already being hit by Russian artillery. I first came across Maxsym, a biology student, in early March. He, and his university friend Dmytro Kisilenko, an 18-year-old studying economics, had signed up to fight shortly after Russia launched its invasion. As they waited alongside others like them, in the bitter cold, to be bussed to their training centre, they looked like young lads off to a festival or a camping trip, except for the old Kalashnikovs they had just been issued. Witnessing 18- and 19-year-olds, full of the invincible sense that young men have, going to war in Europe, just as they had during the blood-soaked years of the 20th Century was moving, depressing, and alarming. It was a sign of the big war that was coming. In March, Maxsym and Dmytro and all Ukrainians were adapting, the way human beings always do in war. After the first shock old lives and routines fade into a new, all-consuming version of real life. During their brief training early in March, we talked about how the war was changing everything. Maxsym already sounded old for his years. ""We can't meet our wives, our girlfriends, our children. We can't do our business, like we were doing before the invasion. But everyone understands that we have a more important mission now. And we will continue doing business, growing up our children. We will kiss our wives and girlfriends many times, but after the war."" Their lives, those of every Ukrainian, were turned upside down, when the Russians invaded on 24 February. So have the lives of all of us who aren't Ukrainian. Despite Russian advances, Maxsym retains an iron-clad determination to fight. His friend Dmytro, who fought in the battle for Kyiv, is remains in the capital. As they were students, service in the Donbas is not compulsory. ""As long as it's necessary to hold, we are ready to freeze in trenches, to lose our hearing. We are ready even to die there, but we will win as much time as it's necessary for the entire civilized world to beat Russia in non-military ways."" He has no time for people calling themselves Ukraine's allies, who say they should trade territory for some kind of accommodation with Vladimir Putin's Russia. ""I think that there is no way to make a deal with Putin. Putin understands only the language of bullets, blood, war crimes and something else. It is impossible to say take this part of the land and the war will end."" I asked Maxsym how the war was changing him. At the start of the year, he was arranging concerts and involved with youth politics in Kyiv. ""Even now I can't answer you exactly because it is very hard to understand that some of your friends, they died in your arms. It is hard to live with that fact... and when we left Rubizhne, it was hard for us to understand that we have lost the battle for this factory; for one of the key cities of Luhansk region."" Back in March, Maxsym used to joke that he hadn't told his parents exactly what he was doing in uniform. ""Now my parents understand me 100%. I try to call them every time I can. My mama sent some uniform for me and my brothers."" His father tried to join the territorial defence in Maxsym's home town, Sumy. ""But he's 65 and too old to fight. So when they turned him down, he phoned me and says 'Maxsym, can I become a part of your unit?' ""They understand me. They support me mentally and financially."" Donbas is full of signs that the Ukrainians expect to lose more territory to this Russian offensive. New lines of trenches have been dug in the rear. Convoys of huge, expensive tractors are being driven west. The sophisticated heavy weapons that they need to try to match and even outgun Russian firepower are arriving, but not fast enough yet to force the invaders back. Maxsym the student has turned into a front-line soldier, engaged he believes in the mission of his life. ""We are fighting for the freedom of the entire world, the entire civilised world and if anyone thinks it is a Ukrainian-Russian war, it isn't. It is the war of the light and the darkness between the Russia and the entire world."" "

The crystal microphone was auctioned on Facebook, with the aim of buying drones for Ukraine's military. The sale coincided with the band's appearance at a charity concert at Berlin's Brandenburg Gate. It aimed to raise money for medical care and supplies. Speaking at the concert, band member Oleh Psiuk appealed for people not to get used to the war, which has left at least 4,031 civilians dead and 4,735 injured, according to the UN, along with an unknown number of combatants. It has also forced more than 14 million people to flee their homes since Russia invaded on 24 February, with towns and cities reduced to rubble. ""I think it should be on the front pages always, until peace comes,"" said Psiuk, whose Eurovision win had been hotly tipped in the run up to the contest. Their song, Stefania, was originally written in tribute to Psiuk's mother, but emotive lyrics like ""I will always walk to you by broken roads"" have been re-interpreted as a rallying cry. Ukrainian TV presenter Serhiy Prytula announced that the money raised from the sale of the trophy would be used to purchase three Ukrainian-made PD-2 drones, Reuters news agency reports. Drones are used heavily by Ukrainian and Russian forces, both as weapons and reconnaissance aircraft. "

He thanked the troops, handed out medals, and said they were facing an ""indescribably difficult"" situation. Russia has resumed shelling Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, after a fortnight of comparative quiet. The industrial city is 42km (26 miles) from the Russian border. Mr Zelensky later announced he had fired the head of the Ukraine Security Service in Kharkiv region, Roman Dudin. He accused him of not working on the city's defence. Ukraine says Russia is still occupying a third of the Kharkiv region. Russian troops have been pushed back from the city's outskirts, but it remains within artillery range. The heaviest fighting is now south-east of Kharkiv, as Russia uses artillery barrages and air strikes to push the Ukrainians from their remaining strongholds in the Donbas region. Kyiv's forces are putting up stiff resistance. Read more about his visit here. The US government appears close to sending a long-range multiple-rocket system (MLRS) to Ukraine. Russia sees such deliveries of heavy weapons as a provocative escalation. President Zelensky and other Ukrainian officials have appealed for the MLRS to counter Russia's offensive in the Donbas. Kyiv's forces are using US-delivered M777 howitzers, which have a range of about 25km (16 miles). But an M270 MLRS battery can fire rockets at targets up to 300km (186km) distant, as can a similar US rocket system called M142 Himars. They would greatly boost the Ukrainians' capabilities - even enabling them to hit targets inside Russia, though such action would risk drawing the US and its Nato allies into direct conflict with Russia. A senior US official quoted by the Washington Post said the White House was comfortable with giving Ukraine the MLRS, but would withhold the longest range rockets compatible with the system. Russia's ambassador to the UK, Andrei Kelin, engaged in a terse interview with the BBC's Clive Myrie on the Sunday Morning programme. He said that Russia would not use tactical nuclear weapons in Ukraine, as it has very strict rules for their use, which apply mainly when the state's existence is threatened. Asked about civilian killings in the town of Bucha, near Kyiv, he said reports of war crimes there were a ""fabrication"" orchestrated by the Ukrainian side after Russia's withdrawal. Satellite imagery appears to directly contradict this position, showing bodies lying in the street nearly two weeks before the Russians left the town. Read more from the interview: Russia won't use nuclear weapons, says ambassador Maria and Zlata had to flee their home village of Orikhiv in the south of Ukraine, after the area was bombarded by Russian shells. The sisters, aged 15 and 10, are world champions in mixed martial arts and are hoping they will still be able to compete for Ukraine, and represent their country at the world championships. They spoke to the BBC as they tried to keep up their training in Zaporizhzhia, where they are now living. A BBC investigation has revealed false and misleading claims by a company called Southern Front, which spreads pro-Putin propaganda across YouTube, social media app Telegram, and through a website targeting areas of Ukraine newly under Russian control. The news site posted its first message on day one of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and now has several correspondents filing stories on a daily basis. The majority of the reports claim to show ""peaceful life"" has been established in occupied areas. The channel often runs stories that justify Russia's invasion.

It was his first official trip outside the Kyiv region since the Russian invasion began on 24 February. He was pictured in a bullet-proof vest surveying ruins in Kharkiv city. Mr Zelensky told soldiers, ""I want to thank each of you for your service."" Later, he sacked the local security chief for ""not defending"" the city. Russia has resumed shelling Kharkiv - Ukraine's second-largest city - in recent days after a fortnight of comparative quiet. The city - Ukraine's second-largest - faced intense bombardment in the war's first months, with images showing tower blocks flattened to rubble. Russian troops were gradually pushed back from its surrounding towns during April and May, prompting some who had fled Kharkiv to return, and the metro to reopen for the first time since the invasion. But the city remains within range of Russian artillery. Several loud explosions were heard in the city after Mr Zelensky's visit. President Zelensky's office posted a video on Telegram with the caption: ""2,229 buildings have been destroyed in Kharkiv and the region. We will restore, rebuild and bring back life. In Kharkiv and all other towns and villages where evil came."" The footage featured Ukrainian soldiers giving Mr Zelensky a tour of the damage wrought by the war, including broken down military vehicles by the side of a road. ""In this war, the occupiers are trying to squeeze out at least some result,"" Mr Zelensky posted later. ""But they should have understood long ago that we will defend our land to the last man. They have no chance. We will fight and we will definitely win."" The president said he had fired Roman Dudin, the chief of the Security Service of Ukraine for the Kharkiv region ""for the fact that he did not work on the defence of the city from the first days of the full-scale war, but thought only about himself"". ""On which motives? The law enforcement officers will figure it out,"" he added. Analysis by Joe Inwood, BBC News Ukraine Correspondent Today's visit to Kharkiv is the first time President Zelensky has left the Kyiv region since the start of Russia's invasion. He met the troops who have not just defended Kharkiv, but repelled the Russians, almost pushing them back to the international border. The fact that he was able to visit shows just how much the tide has turned in Ukraine's second city. A few weeks ago, this morale-boosting visit would never have been possible. But, do not be mistaken, Kharkiv is only safe for now. Elsewhere, Ukraine very much appears on the back foot, with Russian artillery barrages forcing troops to retreat in the Donbas. With its charismatic president, Ukraine has very much won the informational war. Unfortunately for Ukrainians, that is not where this conflict will ultimately be decided. The president met Kharkiv's mayor and the regional governor to discuss reconstruction plans, reportedly urging them to ""find cool projects"" to help rehabilitate the ravaged city. ""This is a chance for such districts to have a new face,"" Mr Zelensky said. His chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, said 31% of the Kharkiv region's territory was currently occupied by Russia, while 5% had been re-taken by Ukraine after being occupied earlier. Russia is presently concentrating its offensive on the Donbas region in eastern Ukraine, which it has vowed to seize as a key war aim. Russian forces are trying to encircle the cities of Severodonetsk and Lysychansk. On Saturday Russia's defence ministry said it had taken the nearby town of Lyman, in Donetsk - part of the overall Donbas region. ""The situation is very difficult, especially in those areas in the Donbas and Kharkiv regions,"" Mr Zelensky said on Saturday in his daily address to the nation. An estimated 15,000 civilians are still in Severodonetsk, where a local official said ""constant shelling"" made it hard to get in or out. The water supply is increasingly precarious. Oleksandr Stryuk, head of the city's military and civil administration, said evacuation is ""very unsafe"", noting ""it's isolated cases when we manage to get people out"". ""Now the priority is for the wounded and people who need serious medical assistance."" "

The families, who were temporarily housed in a Livingston hotel, were given three hours to pack and get on a bus to Aberdeen. The Scottish government said it was voluntary and no-one was forced to go. Supporters of those who stayed in West Lothian said translators should have been there to reduce confusion. The temporary residents of the Livingston hotel were contacted on Friday asking if they would be willing to be moved to Aberdeen that day. A number of rooms near Edinburgh Airport were required to accommodate late-night arrivals also seeking refuge in Scotland from the Russian invasion in Ukraine. However, some of the people felt they had no choice. Local supporters intervened and were able to translate for some of the families before they left. Viktoria, from Kyiv, has been in Livingston with her mother and two sons for three weeks and was delighted to be able to stay after starting to make new friends. Speaking to BBC Scotland from a community event for refugees in Livingston, she said: ""We are very grateful for Scottish people and the government because it's very important what they do for the Ukrainians now. ""It's very difficult to move somewhere and start a new life again."" She added: ""My children have some new friends and they've started to adapt. For example, my oldest son, he is going to football and has new friends here. ""He tries to learn English with them and that is why it is very difficult for us to move to another place in Scotland. If it is possible, we want to stay in this region and maybe find a house for my family."" Rebecca Nicol, who has been volunteering to support families arriving in Livingston, said it had been a ""confusing and worrying situation"" for the families. She went to the hotel after Viktoria called to say she would have to leave in two hours. ""The problem was that they never got enough time,"" Ms Nicol said. ""They didn't have a translator with them. A lot of people don't speak English."" She said the stress for a group of people who had already been forced from their homes because of war could have been lessened if they had been given more notice about moving to Aberdeen. ""They needed ""time to think about it and someone to explain all the details to them properly"", she added. ""I'm worried for [Viktoria] and the other Ukrainian families who are here because I want them to feel welcomed to this region and I want us to find host families for them so they can settle a little bit here and feel safe,"" Ms Nicol said. A Scottish government spokesman said it was working with local government and the third sector to give new arrivals from the war a ""warm Scots welcome"", with temporary hotel accommodation, trauma support, translation, and a national matching service to identify longer-term accommodation. ""A small group of people from Ukraine volunteered to change hotels so that those arriving late at night at Edinburgh Airport could access accommodation close by, rather than having to travel to hotels further afield,"" he said. ""The resettlement team ensured everyone understood this was a voluntary arrangement and that rooms were available should they decide to stay."" "
129,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-61618902,2022-05-29T12:19:30,"Russia won't use tactical nuclear weapons in Ukraine, says ambassador to UK"," Russia's ambassador to Britain has told the BBC he does not believe his country will use tactical nuclear weapons in the war against Ukraine. Andrei Kelin said that according to Russian military rules, such weapons are not used in conflicts like this. He also described allegations of war crimes in the town of Bucha as ""a fabrication"". And he called UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss ""very belligerent"" and inexperienced. On the use of nuclear weapons, Mr Kelin said Russia has very strict rules for their use, mainly when the state's existence is threatened. ""It has nothing to do with the current operation,"" he told BBC One's Sunday Morning. When Vladimir Putin put his nuclear forces on high alert in late February, soon after the invasion, it was widely perceived as a warning. Mr Putin blamed the development on aggression by the West and Nato. But the UK's Defence Secretary Ben Wallace branded it an attempt to distract people from ""what's going wrong in Ukraine"", saying Russia was behind schedule on its invasion after just a few days, and trying to ""remind the world"" it had a deterrent. Tactical nuclear weapons are those which can be used at relatively short distances, as opposed to ""strategic"" nuclear weapons which can be launched over much longer distances and raise the spectre of all-out nuclear war. But the term still includes many types of weapon, including smaller bombs and missiles used on a battlefield. Russia is thought to have about 2,000 tactical nuclear weapons. The BBC's Clive Myrie asked the ambassador about comments made by UK Foreign Minister Liz Truss, who said the war will only end once Russian President Vladimir Putin removes his troops entirely. Mr Kelin said Ms Truss was ""very belligerent"". He said she was ""neither a professional military man"" nor experienced as foreign secretary. ""If she would like to continue the war she will prolongate the conflict,"" he added. In a sometimes terse exchange, the ambassador denied Russian forces were shelling civilians and said allegations of war crimes in the town of Bucha were a ""fabrication"". Asked the question, ""Why is Russia conducting this war in this way, committing war crimes?"" Mr Kelin replied: ""The mayor of Bucha in his initial statement has confirmed that Russian troops has left, everything is clean and calm, the town in a normal state. ""Nothing is happening, no bodies are on the street. But next, after it has been done - but anyway..."" Myrie then pressed him: ""So this is all made up, Sir? This is all a fabrication? All this evidence is a fabrication?"" ""In our view it is a fabrication. It is used just to interrupt negotiations,"" the ambassador replied. Russia has made such allegations before, with Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov earlier claiming that footage of bodies in Bucha was ""staged"" after the Russians withdrew. This was contradicted by numerous eyewitness accounts from residents, who told the BBC that Russian troops had summarily executed their loved ones. ""He was just a peaceful man, a family man, a welder, who struggled with a spine fracture and was disabled all his life,"" one man said of his murdered son-in-law. Satellite imagery also appears to directly contradict Moscow's position, showing bodies lying in the street nearly two weeks before the Russians left the town. The ambassador was also asked about CCTV footage of Russian soldiers killing unarmed civilians in Ukraine. Mr Kelin said the footage was ""probably a piece of a film or a piece of a game or a joke or whatever, it's a computer games set"". What we heard from Russia's UK ambassador Andrei Kelin is what we've been hearing for years from Russian officials whenever their county is accused of anything. All accusations are rebuffed, all evidence of Russian complicity is dismissed. What you end up with is this parallel reality in which CCTV footage of Russian soldiers shooting dead unarmed Ukrainian civilians is dismissed as a joke or a computer game. The horrors of Bucha are dismissed as a fabrication, and the levelling of residential areas of Mariupol is brushed aside as either collateral damage or blamed on Ukrainian soldiers. In other words, none of this is ever Russia's fault, everyone is against Russia, everyone is blaming Russia, everyone is accusing Russia and it claims it is the innocent party. This is the Kremlin narrative which we've heard many times before. We heard it after the Salisbury poisonings, we heard it after the attempted assassination of the Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny and we're hearing it again now.

President Vladimir Putin has signed a law enabling people over 40 to enlist for the armed forces. They are expected to be people of normal working age. Previously the army had age limits of 18-40 years for Russians and 18-30 for foreigners. Russia is presenting it as a move to recruit more technical specialists. The new law says specialists are required to operate high-precision weapons and ""experience shows that they become such by the age of 40-45"". More medics, engineers and communications experts may also be recruited. Ukrainian and Western military experts say Russia has suffered heavy losses in the war: about 30,000 killed, according to Ukraine, while the UK government estimates the toll at about 15,000. In comparison, Soviet losses in nine years of war in Afghanistan in the 1980s totalled about 15,000. Russia gave a total of 1,351 of its troops killed in Ukraine on 25 March, which it has not updated. President Putin has avoided large-scale conscription for what Russia calls its ""special military operation"" in Ukraine. But in March Russia's defence ministry admitted that some conscripts were involved in the conflict and some had been taken prisoner by Ukrainian forces. The defence ministry stressed that it was not official policy to send conscripts into battle. Later, Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu said that those conscripts drafted into the military this spring would not be sent to any hotspots. Conscription, also known as the draft, is a centuries-old practice for states to require large numbers of men to serve in the military. Russia's conscription, dating back to tsarist times, obliges men aged 18 to 27 to serve one year in the military. But many get exemptions on medical grounds, or because they are students. Russia now has more than 400,000 professional ""contract"" soldiers in its 900,000-strong active armed forces. It can also mobilise about two million reservists, military analysts say. Ukraine's army is a lot smaller - it has an estimated 200,000 active troops and 900,000 reservists, though it has boosted those numbers through mass mobilisation since Russia invaded on 24 February. Under its current martial law, Ukraine forbids men aged 18 to 60 from leaving the country, demanding that they stay and fight. So women, children and the elderly form the vast majority of refugees fleeing to neighbouring countries. Ukraine's military says it is not yet conscripting women, but some can be drafted exceptionally if their skills in medicine, IT or other areas are needed. Ukraine has also recruited several thousand foreign volunteer soldiers. Many countries have military conscription, though the rules vary widely. They include Israel, Turkey, Iran, Sweden and Georgia. The UK and US are among many other countries which have fully professional armies, as well as reservists who can be called up in an emergency. The UK had conscription in both world wars, and the US had the draft during the Vietnam War. "

Emmanuel Macron and Olaf Scholz spoke to Mr Putin by phone for 80 minutes. The pair ""insisted on an immediate ceasefire and a withdrawal of Russian troops"", the chancellor's office said. Russia's leader said Moscow was open to resuming dialogue with Kyiv, according to the Kremlin. It did not mention the possibility of direct talks between Mr Putin and his Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelensky. The Ukrainian president earlier said he was not ""eager"" for talks, but added they would likely be necessary to end the conflict. Russian and Ukrainian delegations have held multiple rounds of talks remotely and in person since Russia invaded on 24 February, but efforts have stalled of late. France and Germany also urged Mr Putin to release 2,500 Ukrainian fighters taken as prisoners-of-war at the Azovstal steelworks in Mariupol. The sprawling factory became the last holdout in the southern port city, which endured relentless bombardment from Russian forces and now lies in ruins. Earlier this month, Moscow officials said the last fighters defending the plant had surrendered, while President Zelensky said they had been given permission to leave. Russia has previously said more than 900 of the fighters were moved to a reopened prison colony in Olenivka, a village in Russian-occupied Donetsk. A smaller number with serious wounds were taken to a hospital in the town of Novoazovsk, also in Donetsk. Ukraine hopes they will be released as part of a prisoner exchange - but Russia has not confirmed that. Some Russian lawmakers argue the fighters should be tried or even executed. Also during the call, the French and German leaders asked Mr Putin to lift Russia's blockade of the Ukrainian port of Odesa, to allow for grain exports. The Kremlin said Mr Putin offered to look at options, to help address the risk of a global food crisis - but demanded that the West lift sanctions. Russia also warned France and Germany against increasing weapons supplies to Ukraine, saying that could increase instability still further. Analysis by Joe Inwood, Ukraine Correspondent To read the Kremlin's report of the call between Presidents Putin and Macron and Chancellor Scholz, Russia is engaged in a peacekeeping mission in Ukraine. Its actions in the southern port of Mariupol - a city that has been reduced to rubble - are all about ""establishing peaceful life"" and ""liberation"". It is a stark contrast not just with the readout from the EU allies - who said the focus was on the welfare of the 2,500 prisoners-of-war who surrendered - but with the evidence of all independent observers. There are multiple, credible reports of war crimes carried out by occupying Russian forces. Despite that, the fact that the two most powerful leaders in the EU are holding direct talks with Russia's president is significant. Their call for a diplomatic solution - even as Russian forces advance in the Donbas - is not supported by all Western allies, who fear it could put pressure on Ukraine to cede territory in return for peace. It all comes as Moscow claims to have captured the crucial crossroads city of Lyman - and continues its assault of Severodonetsk. The industrial city has been encircled for days - with reports that Ukraine may order a strategic withdrawal of its forces. It is too soon to say that today's attempts at diplomacy represent a fracturing of the Western alliance… but different positions are beginning to emerge. In an operational update issued on Sunday, Ukrainian military officials said that intense fighting has continued around the city of Severodonetsk, the easternmost place still under Ukrainian control. The governor of the Luhansk region, Serhiy Haidai, said two civilians were killed overnight as Russia continued firing heavily on the city with missile and artillery strikes. On Friday, officials said two-thirds of its perimeter was surrounded by Russian forces. Mr Haidai had said Ukrainian troops could be forced to withdraw from Severodonetsk, observing: ""It is possible that in order not to be surrounded, they will have to leave."" But Yelyzaveta Yasko, a local MP for the region, said on Sunday that Kyiv's troops remained entrenched across the city. ""Severodonetsk for Putin became like one of the places that he really wants to take because he believes that it will give him military power over the whole Donbas region but, as we see that no matter how hard the battles are, still they didn't take it over, all of it,"" she said. ""But for me very painful to say because we still know and hear about the numbers of the victims that are happening there everyday and unfortunately the situation becomes worse also from the humanitarian side,"" Ms Yasko observed. In comments to the BBC on Saturday, Ukraine's Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said the Russian invasion of his country had destroyed more than 25,000 km (15,000 miles) of roads, several hundred bridges, and 12 airports. More than 100 educational institutions, over 500 medical facilities, and 200 factories have also been ruined or damaged, he said. He called for Russia to be forced to pay for ""the destruction it has created"", saying frozen Russian assets should be transferred to Ukraine to fund reconstruction work. "

Oksana Kopanitsyna said being in the same room as someone eating or preparing meat was like ""someone was cutting a child in front of you"". Now living in a bed and breakfast in Ystrad Mynach, Caerphilly county, she said her beliefs were being tested as she looks for her own place to live. The charity Vegan Society said this problem was not uncommon. Oksana was living in Kyiv when she decided it was no longer safe to stay and began her long journey through Europe to the UK. She left her family, her job and her friends behind due to the war. Her grandparents had told her stories of starvation from the past, and when supermarket shelves began to empty, she became ""very scared"". She is dependent on medication and began her journey to Wales in early March, spending nights on train station floors, camping and sleeping on people's sofas. Oksana wants to work and rent her own home, but while waiting for a bank account and job responses, she said she had no choice but to live in the accommodation provided for her. Originally from Donetsk, Oksana made connections with vegans across the world and was offered a place to stay in south Wales with a friend and his family. However, she said she was asked to leave abruptly after discussions about veganism and animal by-products, such as leather. Since then she has been trying to find a home that caters to her needs but said it had been a challenge. ""With like 6% of Wales vegan and then those willing to take me on, my chances are probably under 1%,"" she said. Oksana said she feels ""traumatised"" watching people eat meat. She has said she would stay in any home she is offered, but cannot share a fridge with non-vegans or be in the room when they are cooking or eating animal products. ""I will have my own fridge I will keep in my room and I going to pay them for electricity,"" she said. ""How would it be for you if someone was cutting a child in front of you or keeping body parts in the fridge and you just see a hand or half of face? That is what it feels like for me."" She said Caerphilly council had been ""so helpful"" and were trying to find her a family to suit her needs but said she knows it comes last due to the number of people looking for a host family. ""It's hard for people from Ukraine already because lots of people try to take advantage, renting small rooms for hundreds or in places far away from transportation,"" she said. ""And so, even a regular person it's hard but, for me, it's even harder."" A vegan is someone who doesn't eat or use animal products. Unlike a vegetarian diet - where people do not eat meat or fish - a vegan diet avoids all animal products like dairy, eggs and even honey, as well as meat and fish. Some people prefer to call this way of eating 'a plant-based diet'. Following a vegan lifestyle also means only using or buying cosmetics and clothes free from animal products. Research by the Vegan Society found the number of vegans in Great Britain increased from 150,000 in 2006 to 540,000 in 2016. Many believe the number of people who call themselves vegans could now be in the millions. The charity Vegan Society said someone's veganism needs to be taken as seriously as religious and allergy requirements and it was understandable a vegan refugee would want to live ""in a plant-based household where their values and views are shared by others"". It added: ""Being forced to leave the entire life they know behind is horrific enough, so finding somewhere they can feel safe and respected in an otherwise unfamiliar community, where they can comfortably sustain the values they hold close, shouldn't be a privilege. ""It would be great to see more available support to accommodate vegans, whose ethical beliefs fall within the protection of the law just as those with religious beliefs, so it's important their views are acknowledged and respected in the same way.""

135,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-61441192,2022-05-28T23:59:59,War in Ukraine: The making of a new Russian propaganda machine," The port city of Berdyansk had been occupied by Russian troops for less than a week, but a new pro-Kremlin online media outlet had already moved in. The company, whose name translates as Southern Front, makes and distributes pro-Vladimir Putin propaganda across YouTube, social media app Telegram, and through a website that targets areas newly under Russian control. The Southern Front news site posted its first message on day one of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and now has several correspondents filing stories on a daily basis. The BBC has found evidence that the site's reporting contains falsehoods and misleading claims. In early March, Southern Front's correspondent was at the scene in Berdyansk. They reported that Russian soldiers had apparently thwarted an attack, and killed two Moroccan men involved. The reporter alleged the men were working as mercenaries for Ukraine. But it appears elements of the video were staged. The two Moroccan men identified in the attack were allegedly found with their Ukrainian residency permits still on them. The BBC tracked down one of the men implicated. According to the report he was dead, but we spoke to him on social media. He requested anonymity but says he was not aware of the Russian report and that he left Ukraine before the invasion and returned to Morocco. Southern Front regularly posts videos containing unsubstantiated claims. The majority of the reports claim to show ""peaceful life"" has been established in occupied areas. The channel often runs stories that justify Russia's invasion. In one video package, a correspondent reports from a library where she says she found numerous examples of books containing ""Nazi symbols"". No evidence is seen on screen. The books that do appear on camera include works by contemporary Ukrainian writers about genuine historical events, such as the battle of Ilovaisk. ""Southern Front is likely to be part of the wider Russian strategy to establish control over the occupied territories of Ukraine,"" says Julia Smirnova, an analyst at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue. The company and its social media channels are portraying the Russian occupation in the southern regions of Ukraine as a ""liberation"", and Russian forces as ""protectors"", says Ms Smirnova. Southern Front's first message on Telegram to its small audience of 25 subscribers on the day of the invasion said: ""Vladimir Putin announced the start of a special operation to demilitarise and de-Nazify the territory of Ukraine!"" Three months into the occupation, its audience has now grown to 23,000. A website was registered a day after the invasion started. Initially using a Russian server from St Petersburg, it then moved to the American provider Cloudflare, which allows a site to hide the identity of its owner. The channel produces a regular news service fronted by young, apparently amateur presenters from annexed Crimea or self-declared separatist republics. Ukrainian news sources have been largely cut off. One of the presenters contacted by BBC Russian said they worked for free, and didn't know who funded the operations. We also asked Southern Front about the ownership, but did not receive a reply. But it does appear an influential organisation with ties to the Russian government is hosting Southern Front's content. After researching dozens of videos, we noticed some clues as to who might be behind the shadowy media organisation. Many of them were recorded in a conference room displaying the logo of the Russia-Donbas Integration Committee, which suggests this organisation's premises are used to film. The Crimea-based committee's mission, listed on its website, is to build economic and humanitarian ties with the annexed Crimea and the pro-Russian separatist republics in the Donbas. The leaders of these self-proclaimed republics in eastern Ukraine have key roles in the organisation. The co-ordinator is Andrei Kozenko — a former Russian MP, currently under US and EU sanctions. Southern Front's content reaches far beyond its website. A network of like-minded Telegram accounts covering occupied cities often publishes its material. Collectively, these channels now have more than 80,000 subscribers, although our research shows at least one-third of these were probably paid for to artificially inflate the audience. In three channels the number of followers jumped by more than 10,000 in an hour overnight on 29 March, according to analysis of TG Stat, which tracks Telegram data. Despite the relatively small following on social media, Southern Front has been boosted by influential accounts, including a pro-Russian blogger with more than 650,000 followers, and by pro-Kremlin media such as Moskovsky Komsomolets - a Moscow-based newspaper found in most post-Soviet countries. But the fightback has started. Recently pro-Ukrainian activists hacked Southern Front's website with a message about Kherson, which the region's new rulers say they want to be annexed by Russia. One of the posts warned that any individuals involved in a so-called referendum on the future of the region will be punished by Ukraine. It said: ""Welcome to Hell!!!"" Despite the attack, the site was up and running again shortly afterwards. There are worrying signs for residents if the project establishes itself. After nearby Crimea was annexed in 2014, independent media outlets were expelled, says Ms Smirnova. ""In southern Ukraine, Russian authorities are likely to follow a similar path by threatening and arresting independent journalists, silencing independent media outlets and replacing them with propaganda channels.""

Also on Saturday, Russia scrapped its age limit for professional soldiers, meaning people over 40 can enlist for the armed forces. Previously the army had age limits of 18-40 years for Russians and 18-30 for foreigners. President Putin has avoided large-scale conscription for what Russia calls its ""special military operation"" in Ukraine.

The defence ministry stressed that it was not official policy to send conscripts into battle.

In comparison, Soviet losses in nine years of war in Afghanistan were about 15,000. Russia gave a total of 1,351 dead on 25 March, which it has not updated. Read more here. Since the invasion of Ukraine, an estimated 108,000 Russian citizens have fled to Armenia, in a bid to avoid President Putin's crackdown on dissent. With European destinations closed to Russian airlines, there are few options left. Armenia requires no entry visas and there are regular flights to the capital Yerevan from Moscow. Russians have also moved to Georgia or Turkey, or other destinations that will take them. Challenging Russia's war has become a criminal offence for anyone deemed to have spread ""fake news"", and for Yura Boguslavsky and Asya Kiselyova, both animation artists from Moscow, Russia no longer seemed a safe place to live. ""We got arrested together - Asya, our friends and even her parents,"" said Yura. ""Everyone has relatives and friends in Ukraine. It's crazy, and it's not us who should have been arrested."" Some Ukrainian families have spent more than three months living underground in a metro station in the country's second city of Kharkiv. With no fresh air or access to washing facilities, disease has spread easily and people have suffered from illnesses including Covid-19, Rotavirus and heart and liver problems. After months of intense fighting, Ukrainian forces have pushed Moscow's forces away from the city and back into Russian territory. But the people here say intense fighting has destroyed their homes and that, despite the metro having reopened, they have nowhere else to go. One man, 45-year-old Arif Bagirov, has told the BBC about his bike ride like no other. He managed to flee the heavily-bombed eastern city of Severodonetsk by cycling - and dodging Russian shells and warplanes.

Speaking at a pro-gun conference, Mr Trump questioned how the US ""has $40 billion to send to Ukraine"" but cannot ensure security in schools. The meeting of the National Rifle Association (NRA), the largest US gun group, is taking place in Houston. The intervention comes days after 21 people died in a Texas school shooting. ""Before we nation-build the rest of the world, we should be building safe schools for our own children in our own nation,"" Mr Trump said in Friday's speech, drawing loud applause. Earlier this month, the US Congress overwhelmingly voted to send nearly $40bn (£31bn) in military aid to Ukraine. In total, US lawmakers have sent about $54bn to Ukraine since Russia invaded in February. ""Congress should vote immediately to take back every penny of unused Covid relief money,"" Mr Trump went on. ""Take it back from the states and use that money to quickly establish impenetrable security at every school all across our land."" Mr Trump rejected calls for tightened gun controls, saying decent Americans should be allowed firearms to defend themselves against ""evil"". He instead proposed a ""top-to-bottom overhaul"" of school safety, with fortified single points of entry including metal detectors and at least one armed police officer on every campus. He accused Democrats of stonewalling such security measures. The former Republican president began his speech by reading out the names of the Uvalde shooting victims, with each marked by a bell toll. The annual conference of the NRA, which has five million members, is taking place 280 miles (450 km) from Uvalde, the scene of the worst school shooting in the US in a decade. Ahead of the event, several conservative speakers and musical performers announced they were backing out - including Senator John Cornyn and the manufacturer of the rifle used in the Uvalde attack. Mr Trump hit out at those who withdrew, telling the crowd: ""Unlike some, I didn't disappoint you by not showing up."" Texas Governor Greg Abbott, who had been slated to speak in person at the event, instead told the crowd via videolink that gun laws are ineffective at preventing mass shootings. ""There are thousands of laws on the books across the country that limit the owning or using of firearms - laws that have not stopped madmen from carrying out evil acts on innocent people and peaceful communities,"" Mr Abbott said. ""In Uvalde, the gunman committed a felony under Texas law before he even pulled the trigger. It is a felony to possess a firearm on school premises. But that did not stop him."" Mr Trump called in his speech for the US to ""drastically change our approach to mental health"". He made a similar call during his presidency, even while critics at the time accused him of trying to defund medical programmes that included mental healthcare. Before Mr Trump spoke, Texas Senator Ted Cruz blamed mass shootings mainly on absent fathers, declining church attendance, social media and video games. Mr Cruz also reiterated his pro-gun stance and urged delegates ""not react to evil and tragedy by abandoning the Constitution or infringing on the rights of our law-abiding citizens"". ""If the left disarms America, those crimes would no longer be stopped,"" Mr Cruz said. ""Many more single moms in subways would be assaulted or raped or murdered. Home invasions would turn much more deadly, as only the criminals would have guns. And far more children would be murdered."" Outside the venue, hundred of protesters gathered to oppose the NRA. They held signs saying ""NRA kill kids"", ""protect children not guns"" and held crosses and photos of shooting victims. "

But two months on, how has it been working out and are there areas of concern? More than 60,000 people fleeing Ukraine have arrived in the UK - some with family visas and others under the Homes for Ukraine sponsorship scheme, which enables members of the public to host an individual or group. Latest figures show 115,000 visas have been issued. But the experience of settling into life in the UK has differed wildly for many Ukrainians. While there are many positive stories, charities have also warned of overcrowding, a lack of financial support and the risk of homelessness - particularly for people arriving on the family visa scheme that enables Ukrainians to join relatives who were already in the UK. There is a ""lot of pressure"" among Ukrainians living in the UK to bring as many relatives over as possible, according to Kate Smart, CEO of the advice charity Settled. She says this can lead to people saying yes to ""more than they can cope with"", and is something we are ""most concerned"" about. ""So people are ending up at the doors of local authorities needing homeless accommodation,"" Kate adds. She says part of the problem is that those hosting their own relatives need more financial support. Under the sponsorship scheme, hosts are entitled to a monthly £350 tax free payment - but people hosting family members are not. ""It's been the hardest time of our lives,"" says Natalia Korchevska, a Ukrainian woman in the UK who has opened her home to relatives fleeing the war. For the past two months she has been living in a house of nine people. Natalia and her husband welcomed her sister and family, as well as her husband's sister, to their five-bedroom house in Staffordshire. ""I know it's my family and I want to help,"" she says. ""But I want the government to help a bit more."" ""We've had no support at all,"" she says, from financial support to government guidance, since her relatives arrived on family visas. The communities department says people on both family and sponsorship visas have access to the same services as UK nationals, and councils are receiving £10,500 in funding for each arrival under the sponsorship scheme. Natalia, who works for the NHS, explains that a change allowing people who have travelled on a family visa to switch to the sponsorship scheme would really help. ""I'm frustrated and not happy, but it's my family so I will support them."" While many relationships between hosts and refugees are positive, some Ukrainians have ended up needing homeless accommodation as a result of relationships breaking down. Kate Smart from the Settled charity says she is ""getting quite a few calls about it"". And councils are ""already seeing a concerning increase in homelessness"" among those who have arrived from Ukraine, says Cllr James Jamieson, chair of the Local Government Association. In those cases, it would be best if families were ""re-matched"" with a new sponsor so they ""can rebuild their lives in their new communities,"" he says. One Ukrainian refugee who recently arrived in north-east England says she and her teenage son were left homeless after being manipulated by their hosts. ""I am fleeing the war and all of a sudden I am on the street,"" says the woman, 45 who fled Bucha, north of Kyiv. The mother and her 13-year-old son - whose identities are being protected - told the BBC she thought her hosts would be kind and caring, but within weeks she ""did not feel safe or secure"". If there is a breakdown in relationships, re-matching should be the priority, rather than temporary homeless accommodation, agrees Sara Nathan from Refugees at Home. More briefing before arrival, financial support to relatives hosting family members, and an awareness that hosts are not wholly responsible for their guests' wellbeing, are also among Sara's proposals. ""The hosts are doing a great thing by providing shelter, warmth, food and a listening ear, but they can't be 100% responsible."" The government says ""very few"" of these sponsorships are breaking down, and when they do local authorities have provided support or found a more suitable sponsor. Choosing a location in the UK can be ""tricky"" for Ukrainian refugees, according to Sara Nathan, who has hosted refugees in the past. People coming often want to live in cities or towns to avoid feeling ""isolated and lonely,"" she says. Some 93% of Ukrainian refugees are living in England and more than a third live in London, research from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) shows.. The figures, collected in April, also show that 69% would prefer to live in an urban area and 36% said London was the place in the UK they most wanted to live. Anastasia Salnikova, who is from Ukraine and volunteers helping refugees in the UK, says she would encourage people not to go to London because it can be ""a hectic and busy place"" and difficult without language skills. But people feel frightened and want a community so they ""gravitate to London"" she says. Tanya, a translator from Sumy in Ukraine - one of the first places targeted by the Russians, was in Kyiv for work on the day that war broke out, and ended up trapped there for a month. She reconnected with her daughter Sonya and they travelled to Poland where she volunteered to help refugees - before applying to come to the UK through the sponsorship scheme. Upon arrival they received lots of donations from the local community, including clothes, food parcels and a bike - and their hosts used flags to decorate their room. ""People are really lovely and kind here,"" says Tanya, adding they have received lots of welcoming messages from people on Facebook. Tanya urged people coming from eastern Ukraine, ""don't be afraid"". ""It was really scary in the first few days, but nothing like the first few days when the war started. ""I would say thank you to all the British people - from human to human, thank you."" Anastasia Salnikova says it is getting more ""difficult"" for those wanting to come to the UK to find sponsors. ""The good thing is a lot of people… are very willing,"" she says, adding that Facebook posts get ""lots of responses"". The first wave of people who came to the UK were generally those who escaped early and had a bit of money, but those who are only recently free from places like Bucha and Mariupol are ""in a disadvantaged situation"". More than 100,000 Britons signed up as potential hosts under the Homes for Ukraine scheme on its first day, but since then the momentum has slowed down, Anastasia says. People are planning holidays so are less available, and others have been deterred by recent ""negative publicity"" about relationship breakdowns with hosts, she adds. Oleg Nedava, who fled from Donetsk to Kyiv in 2014 and is now a refugee in the UK, has called for more support to create hubs ""where we can all gather together to talk"". Oleg, a former Ukrainian MP, and his wife Irina were visiting their children in the UK when Russia invaded Ukraine, and have been living with one daughter in Surrey under a family visa. He describes the welcome he has received as ""beautiful"". ""It's been amazing that we've been really welcomed,"" he says. With Ukrainians searching for work in the UK, the issue of obtaining safeguarding checks for certain jobs has arisen. Speaking to BBC Radio 5 Live, former MP Edwina Currie says a Ukrainian woman she is hosting applied for a job at her children's school. ""[She] was promptly told that because they couldn't check her [Disclosure and Barring Service] status… she couldn't be considered for the job."" Edwina says it ""needs sorting out"" so those arriving can take work opportunities in places like schools. ""Many of the people looking for work are mothers with young children, it will suit them for example to be working in school kitchens."" Some 82% of Ukrainians arriving in the UK were female and 48% reported that they had at least one dependent child to the ONS survey conducted in April. Ukrainian refugees are able to apply for criminal records checks and guidance is offered to make the process ""more accessible"", the Home Office says. Work coaches, training programmes specialising in the hospitality and agriculture sector and language courses are among the support being offered to Ukrainian refugees, the Department for Work and Pensions adds.

Most of the guests were artists and musicians who had fled Russia. Bride and groom Yura Boguslavsky and Asya Kiselyova, both animation artists from Moscow, moved here to escape Russia's crackdown on anti-war protesters. ""We got arrested together - Asya, our friends and even her parents,"" said the bridegroom. ""Everyone has relatives and friends in Ukraine. It's crazy, and it's not us who should have been arrested."" Challenging Russia's war has become a criminal offence, for anyone deemed to have spread ""fake news"". Since the invasion of Ukraine, an estimated 108,000 Russian citizens have come here. With European destinations closed to Russian airlines, there are few options left. Armenia requires no entry visas and there are regular flights here from Moscow. The two countries have long-standing ties. Armenia is Russia's strategic ally in the South Caucasus region and hosts a Russian military base as well as being part of the Russian-led security alliance CSTO. Russians have also moved to Georgia or Turkey, or other destinations that will take them. After his detention, strange, anti-government messages appeared on Yura's phone as the couple were preparing to board their flight to the capital, Yerevan. Yura was well aware that Russia's FSB security service had been ordering people to unlock their phones to reveal personal messages and contacts. He feared the messages may have been an attempt to incriminate him, but he made it through security without being stopped. As the guests brought out tables and erected gazebos, the bride's mother, Valeriya Kiselyova, revealed that back in Russia her husband had stopped a car with the letter Z emblazoned on its windscreen - one of the propaganda symbols of the invasion. ""He took out a shovel and ordered them to rip it off. I realised then that we had to leave to avoid being imprisoned,"" she said. Wedding guest Polina Prokofyeva described spending 12 days in a prison cell for taking part in an anti-war rally in St Petersburg. ""The whole process was so humiliating, they try to make you feel that you are nobody and your voice means nothing,"" she said. After a three-minute court hearing, she said she was convicted of taking part in resisting Russia's so-called special military operation. Many Russian emigres here are IT specialists who see Armenia as a practical place to resettle. The arrival of tens of thousands of highly skilled Russian citizens will have a positive impact on Armenia's economy, says Haykaz Fanyan of the Armenian Centre for Socioeconomic Studies. ""In March, Armenia's accommodation and food services sector recorded growth of 230% and 30% compared with the same period last year. Relocated Russians established 1,500 enterprises, of which 300 are companies and the rest are private entrepreneurs."" Among them was Dima, a 34-year Muscovite, who has just opened a cafe serving Israeli and Korean food. ""At the beginning of March the centre of Yerevan looked like the centre of Moscow, there were so many Russians,"" he said. ""They looked lost and didn't know what to do."" He had been considering leaving Russia even before the war. ""We've been losing our freedom for some time, now it's dangerous for me to go back because two years ago I posted some anti-government message on Facebook, I could be jailed for it now."" Sitting at his cafe were a young couple. ""I served in a regular army for a year, and now I'd have to serve again as there was mobilisation,"" says video games developer Sergei. ""I didn't want to be jailed for avoiding military service, but I also did not want to kill innocent people, so I decided to leave."" He is ashamed of once voting for Vladimir Putin while serving in the army in return for more food: ""I sold my country for two gingerbread cookies."" His partner Anya, an English tutor, dropped out of her third year at university when her head of department declared that Ukrainians deserved what Russia was inflicting on them. ""It opened my eyes, I could not believe it that those responsible for teaching could say such things, that it was right to kill someone and that it was not right to say anything against it."" Russian state TV has not just spread propaganda and disinformation about the war in Ukraine, it has also reported on riots in Armenia that never happened. Anya said she had to reassure her mother that recent anti-government protests had been largely peaceful: ""I checked the reports she was talking about and found out that Russian TV used footage from riots in France."" Opposition protesters set up a tent city, demanding Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan's resignation over territory lost to neighbouring Azerbaijan during a 2020 war. Here too, Kremlin disinformation has found a ready audience, as most Armenians speak Russian. ""We are for Russia, the Russians are our brothers,"" said one female protester. Others gathered around, voicing their support. Vardan Makhitaryan picks up the conversation: ""We don't want this democracy that destroyed the strong Armenian army, and Russia does not want it either. Why is the whole world looking at Russia with wolf eyes? Russia did not attack Ukraine, it is just defending itself."" Sentiments like these may be of concern for recent Russian arrivals who oppose the war against Ukraine, and Polina Prokofyeva fears Armenia may not be the safe haven that dissidents need. She points out that some hotels have been asked by police to hand over data of their Russian guests. ""Just talking to people in Yerevan, I feel they don't really get what's going on and they're on the side of my government which punished me and all my friends,"" she said. But Valeriya, mother of the bride, said she had nothing but gratitude for the welcome she had so far received. ""Since leaving Russia, I've seen so much beauty. Had it not been for the war I would have died from happiness."" "

Warmonger!"" cried the crowd angrily as Chancellor Olaf Scholz took to the stage. Grey-haired trade unionists held signs that read ""no weapons, no war"". Usually a workers' rights demonstration in Düsseldorf would be a cosy affair for a chancellor from the centre-left Social Democrats. But these left-wing activists were outraged that his government was sending weapons to Ukraine. ""It's cynical to tell Ukrainians they should defend themselves against Putin's aggression without weapons,"" he shouted back, battling to make himself heard over the booing. However vocal, these German unionists are in a minority. Home and abroad, Mr Scholz has come under attack for not sending Ukraine enough weapons. Leading politicians from across Germany's political spectrum accuse Mr Scholz of acting as a brake on arms deliveries. Poland's President Andrzej Duda has accused Berlin of breaking its word, saying that modern German Leopard tanks, promised by Berlin to backfill Soviet-era tanks sent to Ukraine, have not arrived. Internationally there is a perception that Germany does not want to arm Ukraine. ""I don't understand why it's so complicated,"" said a frustrated Ukrainian foreign minister this week. President Volodymyr Zelensky's adviser went on social media to plead for multiple launch rocket systems (MLRS). In reality Berlin is supplying large amounts of weapons; not as much as the US, but comparable to other European countries. Experts say Germany ranks somewhere in the middle. The German parliament has voted overwhelmingly in favour of supplying heavy weapons. Most mainstream politicians and almost all parties support the move, including Olaf Scholz's own Social Democrat SPD, his coalition partners, the Greens and the liberal FDP, as well as the conservative opposition. The far-right AfD and radical left-wing Die Linke are the only parties to object to arming Ukraine. Both are struggling in the polls and are fractured by internal spats. There have been objections to weapons deliveries in the media debate, such as a public letter written by some academics and media personalities. But none of the signatories have political influence, and few have any expertise on Russia or Ukraine. And yet, despite the consensus in the political mainstream, Mr Scholz still appears hesitant. In speeches he repeats set phrases like ""Putin must not win, Ukraine must exist"". Inexplicably he never talks about Ukraine winning the war. Unlike many leading German politicians, he still hasn't visited Kyiv since Russia's invasion, saying that going for a ""photo-op"" is pointless. This has sparked outrage in Germany, with photos shared on social media of Mr Scholz shaking hands with various dignitaries all over the world, clearly for photo-ops. On the one hand Mr Scholz pledges full support for Ukraine. On the other, the security council that he chairs hasn't signed off requests for modern Leopard or Marder tanks which suppliers say they could send and which Ukraine wants. This week Marie-Agnes Strack-Zimmermann, chair of the parliament's defence committee and defence expert for the liberal FDP, a party in Scholz's own governing coalition, said it was unacceptable that Germany was seen in the world as putting the brakes on military help for Ukraine ""simply because we're not able to communicate properly and organise ourselves"". She wants a transparent list of what Germany is delivering and better coordination, saying the chancellor ""can pull all the strings"" when it comes to arms deliveries. ""I'm trying to understand why he doesn't. Is out of conviction or because of his party?"" Certainly in polls, Social Democrat voters are some of the most likely to oppose arming Ukraine. The SPD traditionally believes peace in Europe can only be achieved by working with, not against Moscow. Some influential party figures would rather focus on a peace deal with Vladimir Putin and believe sending weapons to Ukraine might escalate the conflict. Overall the public mood is divided, febrile and changeable: Either way people are confused. Until recently Mr Scholz said sending tanks would mean escalation and that Germany didn't have enough tanks to send anyway. Then he said tanks could be sent to Poland, but those don't seem to have arrived and it's not clear what the agreement was anyway. Now the message is that Berlin is sending Gepard defensive tanks directly to Ukraine, but not Leopard or Marder offensive tanks, because of a supposed informal agreement with Nato. Other countries don't seem to have such fraught public rows about the details of arms deliveries. But the lack of clarity is making people increasingly nervous and undermining trust in Mr Scholz's leadership. His ratings are falling and his SPD party has lost two major state elections in the last month. His aim appears to be a conciliatory middle ground of compromise to avoid escalation, understandable given Germany's traumatic war-torn 20th Century. But the danger is that by trying to keep everyone happy, Mr Scholz satisfies no-one - least of all Ukraine. "

The town is in the northern part of Donetsk and part of the overall Donbas region in eastern Ukraine that Russia has vowed to seize as a key war aim. Ukrainian officials are conceding that the town has been lost to pro-Russian forces, but not necessarily all of it. A Kyiv defence official says troops are battling to keep control of its north-western and south-eastern areas. Our Digital Europe Editor Paul Kirby says taking control of Lyman is a significant moment in the slow advance of Russia's proxy forces in eastern Ukraine. Lyman is not a big place in itself, but it gives Russian-backed forces control of a key east-west road. It also means they are now within 20km (12 miles) of the city of Slovyansk, to the south-west. Slovyansk is a major transport and supply hub for Ukraine, even though the trains stopped running there weeks ago. The other big battle is further east, where Russian forces are targeting the twin cities of Severodonetsk and Lysychansk. On Friday a Ukrainian defence official in eastern Ukraine said Ukrainian forces could pull out of Severodonetsk ""to avoid being surrounded"". Serhiy Haidai said Russian forces had entered part of the city and said the main road to Ukrainian-held territory was under bombardment but still passable. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said Russian troops were ""continuing to chew through ground"" in the Donbas region and called for more military support for Ukraine. News presenter and correspondent Zhanna Agalakova was one of the most famous faces on Russian state television until March, when she quit her job over the war in Ukraine. Agalakova, who is now in hiding, tells the BBC's Newsnight that Russian TV is a ""brainwashing machine"" and she wishes people would switch it off. ""It's like two different planets,"" she says, contrasting Russian TV telling viewers Vladimir Putin's invading forces are being cheered and handed flowers with the images of death and tragedy in Ukraine seen by viewers the rest of the world. When officers from the UK's National Crime Agency (NCA) arrived at a London apartment on 17 May to carry out a search, it soon became clear that it was no ordinary property. Stretching to 7,000 sq/ft (650 sq/m) the apartment - in one of London's wealthiest districts - had seven en-suite bedrooms spanning three floors, an internal lift, a transparent grand piano in the lounge and a private-access underground garage. This is the work of a new team within the NCA called K-Cell - the K stands for kleptocracy, which is when rulers use their power to steal their country's resources. Their mission is to make life difficult - or, as they put it, ""introduce friction"" - into the life of sanctioned oligarchs, the super-rich businessmen close to the Kremlin. Fertiliser prices have been breaking records amid extreme weather, transport disruptions and now the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Russia produces large quantities of key chemicals used in the production of fertilisers. It also supplies much of the natural gas used to produce ammonia - a major component of nitrogen fertilisers. The conflict is making other countries aware of their dependency on Russia for fertiliser. Rachael Sharp, a third-generation farmer in the US state of South Carolina who grows a varied mix of soybeans, corn, wheat, cotton, peanuts and oats, saw fertiliser prices for her crops soar 320% last year - the sharpest rise that she, or her father, can remember. She says some of her fellow farmers aren't planting anything due to the excessive costs. An annual well-dressing festival with roots believed to date back as far as the 14th Century has returned to an English village - this time, with a Ukrainian theme. It is believed the tradition of decorating wells in Tissington, Derbyshire, began after locals survived the Black Death, which they credited to the water supply's purity. The wells are dressed by applying clay on wooden boards and using materials like coffee beans to make an outline and are then decorated with natural materials. "

Serhiy Haidai, governor of Luhansk, said Russians were in part of the city. ""It is possible that in order not to be surrounded, they will have to leave."" Russia has made seizing the whole eastern Donbas region a key war aim. Ukraine is pleading for long-range weaponry to resist Russia's advance, but the US has so far not offered it. On Friday UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said Ukraine needed long-range multiple-launch rocket systems. ""I'm afraid that Putin, at great cost to himself and to the Russian military, is continuing to chew through ground in Donbas,"" he told Bloomberg. ""He's continuing to make gradual, slow, but I'm afraid palpable, progress and therefore it is absolutely vital that we continue to support the Ukrainians militarily."" In Severodonetsk Mr Haidai said more than half the housing had been destroyed and almost all buildings there had been damaged. All remaining residents were in shelters. The road out of the city to Ukraine-held territory was under constant fire but still passable, he added. Also on Friday, pro-Russian forces seized the town of Lyman to the west of Severodonetsk, setting the scene for an advance towards the major cities of Slovyansk and Kramatorsk. By BBC Digital Europe Editor Paul Kirby Seizing Lyman represents a significant moment in the slow advance of Russia's proxy forces in eastern Ukraine. The battle for the city has been intense, even if Ukrainian forces started pulling back from it earlier this week. It's the second major success for Russia this week, following the fall of Svitlodarsk further south. Lyman is not a big city in itself, but it gives Russia's proxies control of a key east-west road. It also means they are now within 20km (12 miles) of the city of Slovyansk, to the south-west. Slovyansk is a major transport and supply hub for Ukraine, even though the trains stopped running there weeks ago. The other big battle is further to the east, where Russian forces are targeting the twin cities of Severodonetsk and Lysychansk. These are important cities in Ukraine's industrial heartland known as Donbas and losing them would be a significant blow for the army. Away from the battlefield, Russian President Vladimir Putin accused Ukraine of ""sabotaging"" peace talks during a call with Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer. According to Moscow's readout of the call, Putin also denied that his country's blockade of Ukrainian ports was to blame for disruption to global food supplies, suggesting the real cause was sanctions imposed by the US and the EU. The UN has warned that Russia's invasion could soon cause a global food crisis that may last for years. It has reduced global supplies of cereals such as maize and wheat as well as cooking oil and caused the price of alternatives to soar. Global food prices are almost 30% higher than the same time last year, according to the UN. Meanwhile the Moscow branch of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church says it is cutting ties with Russia because of the Russian Orthodox Church Patriarch's support for the war. ""We disagree with the position of Patriarch Kirill of Moscow... on the war,"" the Church said in a statement. It also declared the ""full independence and autonomy of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church."" Ukraine is highly significant for Russia's Orthodox Church and is home to many important monasteries. Part of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church had already broken away from Moscow in 2019. "

There are serious issues on the agenda, centred around the war in Ukraine. But it's doubtful the major, unresolved matter will specifically be up for discussion. That is the EU's beleaguered attempts to ban imports of Russian oil. It's now nearly a month since European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced her proposals. ""This will be a complete import ban on all Russian oil, seaborne and pipeline, crude and refined,"" she told the European Parliament. It was to be an ""orderly"" transition, phasing out Russian crude within six months and refined products by the end of 2022. But resistance, notably from Hungary, has held up the EU's troubled sixth package of sanctions. Other landlocked countries, such as Slovakia and the Czech Republic, have also asked for more time due to their dependence on Russian oil. Bulgaria, already cut off from Russian gas by Gazprom, has likewise sought opt-outs. But Prime Minister Viktor Orban's Hungarian government, which has compared an oil ban to dropping a nuclear bomb on its economy, is seen as the ultimate obstacle. He wrote to the European Council to say he didn't even want to discuss it next week. Diplomats are getting frustrated but they also concede that, with soaring energy prices, some countries may not be entirely unhappy that a decision is being blocked. More hard-line nations are clear that Europe must stop handing Russia billions in what they see as ""blood money"". However, there's also a feeling that Ursula von der Leyen has mishandled things, announcing plans before doing the necessary groundwork. Nevertheless, both she and the head of the European Council this week suggested a deal on oil might happen within days. That was ""absolutely bonkers"", remarked one EU diplomat: ""Charles Michel is setting his own European Council up for failure."" Little time is left with leaders gathering in Brussels on Monday. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has voiced his anger at the delays: ""Of course, I am grateful to our friends who are promoting new sanctions,"" he said in Thursday's late night address. ""But where did those who block the sixth package get so much power? Why are they still allowed to have so much power, including in intra-European procedures?"" While sanctions are signed off at ambassador level, rather than at big EU summits, there had been hopes that the European Council might focus minds and force the issue. The extraordinary council was originally called, in part, because the pre-scheduled June summit felt a long way away, in the midst of a war on European soil. But items actually on the agenda, say diplomats, are principally things that are already bubbling along without the need for a major meeting. Officially up for discussion are financial support for Ukraine, food security, defence procurement and broader issues on the EU's energy transition. Draft conclusions, seen by the BBC, do refer to the phase-out of Russian fossil fuels while glossing over the specific issue of oil sanctions. ""Avoiding a debate is not very realistic,"" suggested one senior diplomat. The odds are that someone will bring it up: elephants in the room have ways of making themselves heard. The question is whether a debate turns into a bust-up. There is frustration that this delay is preventing other measures from going forward, given that the sixth sanctions package isn't just about oil. It also proposes expanding export controls and the list of individuals subject to asset freezes, as well as targeting Russia's majority state-owned Sberbank. Member states quickly signed off the other sanctions packages, including a phased embargo on Russian coal. Officials had talked proudly about how the EU had defied the old narratives about sluggish, tortured EU decision-making. And they had, until now. But in his letter this week the Hungarian leader warned Charles Michel that discussing the oil embargo would ""only highlight our internal divisions"". Phasing out Russian oil, he argued, would require ""a complete rearrangement of our refinery capacities"". In other words, it's going to cost a lot of money, which has made some suspicious that Mr Orban is ultimately angling for more cash. European Parliament President Roberta Metsola is optimistic that Hungary is essentially adopting a ""negotiating stance"". However, funds recently earmarked to help with the EU's energy transition come from a pot of money that Hungary does not yet have access to. It's all part of a financial tug-of-war between Brussels and Budapest, over accusations that the Orban government is presiding over an erosion of democratic standards. His supporters argue Hungary is maligned for forging its own path and quite justified in resisting a ruinous oil ban without sufficient guarantees. Various ideas have been floated, such as putting price caps or tariffs on Russian oil to squeeze the Kremlin's revenues. Another recent proposal was cutting seaborne supplies first and leaving pipelines until later. But while it is widely accepted that some countries will need more time and support, each compromise brings its complications. EU ambassadors gather for a preparatory meeting on the eve of the summit. Most think this troubled sanctions package will get over the line at some point but this has been an embarrassing episode for the European Commission. How far it will have to water it down will dictate any further level of embarrassment. "

Stretching to 7,000 sq ft (650 sq m) the apartment - in one of London's wealthiest districts - had seven en-suite bedrooms spanning three floors, an internal lift, a transparent grand piano in the lounge and a private-access underground garage. The officers carrying out the raid also noticed that the internal doors had no handles - they were, like almost everything else in the property, controlled electronically. It was no ordinary property and this was no ordinary search. The target was not the owner of the property - even though the owner is a sanctioned Russian oligarch. The target was someone described in a piece of intelligence the NCA had received as the ""domestic"". The ""domestic"" had recently had £400,000 deposited into their bank account. The suspicion was that this was to pay for the upkeep of the property and to settle bills. And the possibility that the money had come from the sanctioned individual meant that there was sufficient evidence to justify the search warrant to look for evidence. It was originally suspected that the domestic might be the cleaner, but further investigation after the raid pointed instead to a family member - the NCA will not disclose the identity of those targeted. This is the work of a new team within the NCA called K-Cell - the K stands for kleptocracy, which is when rulers use their power to steal their country's resources. Their mission is to make life difficult - or, as they put it, ""introduce friction"" - into the life of sanctioned oligarchs, super-rich businessmen close to the Kremlin. The BBC was given exclusive access to the team's work. More than 1,000 individuals have been sanctioned by the UK government, including a flood of new names following the invasion of Ukraine in February. While not all of them have substantial links to the UK, those Russians who do have assets here will find them frozen. Assets are not formally seized by the state, but they cannot be used unless the individual receives a special licence from HM Treasury - like the one provided to Chelsea Football Club, owned by Roman Abramovich, before its sale. And if anyone else knowingly deals with a frozen asset or funds, the NCA can investigate. This is the basis for searches like the one at the apartment the K-Cell carried out, looking for evidence of breaches when someone - like an associate or family member - has been passed money to evade sanctions. For Russians who have moved money to the UK and bought property here - expensive properties that need to be maintained - not being able to pay the cleaner, or the gardener, or your driver, can make life very difficult. Security guards also need to be paid. Not having a licence for security might mean protesters can gain access, as they did in March at a £50m London mansion linked to Russian billionaire and industrialist, Oleg Deripaska, which was lying empty. Crucially, investigating suspected breaches also offers a route to go after those providing professional services to sanctioned individuals - known as ""enablers"". On another raid earlier this month, NCA officers turned up at the black, iron security gates of a grand mansion in Surrey clutching a warrant. Once past the perfectly manicured hedges and lawns, and inside the property's grand entrance hall, filled with fresh flowers and works of art, they searched a man dressed in black. The man was not the sanctioned Russian owner of the property - a house which includes swimming pools, multiple wine cellars (red and white), and a room specially designed to store furs at the optimum temperature. The man searched was a Briton suspected of being the oligarch's ""professional enabler"" who manages businesses and property on the oligarch's behalf. Tens of thousands of pounds of cash was eventually retrieved from the enabler's own home, along with £1.5m in bank accounts, all frozen because they are believed to be linked to the sanctioned Russian. In one of the few cases that have previously been made public, account freezing orders were also obtained in March on the bank accounts of British businessman Graham Bonham-Carter, based on the suspicion that the funds were derived from the assets of Oleg Deripaska. Enablers can include professionals like private bankers, estate agents, specialist concierges, accountants and solicitors. All of these are now the target of the K-Cell, which grew out of a team set up after the Salisbury poisoning to target corrupt elites. ""The Kleptocracy Cell is not beginning from a standing start,"" says Steve Smart, NCA Director of Intelligence. ""We have significant experience and capability in this space, and are using the full range of capabilities, both covert and overt, and bringing together our work with the private sector as well as other government departments and agencies."" The NCA is tight-lipped about exactly where the intelligence to support its investigations comes from. Law enforcement normally judges success by prosecutions. But this team's measure is different. Changing behaviour is seen as success as much as an appearance in court. NCA officials say intelligence shows some individuals are choosing not to invest corrupt funds in the UK as a result of their work. Enablers like lawyers may also become nervous of the reputational damage of working with sanctioned oligarchs. The NCA has also been engaging with estate agents and watching for ways money might be moved across borders, including through cryptocurrency. ""We are investigating enablers who support the transactions of corrupt elites, and we are targeting less conventional routes used to disguise movements of significant wealth, such as high value asset sales via auction houses,"" says Steve Smart. Friction can also mean tightening regulations - for example making it harder for people to fly in to the UK on private jets or bring security guards into the country if they do not have the correct visa. But officials acknowledge that there are significant challenges. Officers who work under a tight layer of security, are all too aware their work will be contested. ""Our targets have vast wealth and are some of the most litigious people on the planet,"" says one officer. Backed by huge resources, potentially including those of the Russian state, the K-Cell's targets can tie up the NCA in legal challenges lasting years. ""They are very motivated to protect their wealth, influence and reputation,"" says Steve Smart. The cell is also playing catch-up. Russian oligarchs have had decades to cover up the murky origins of their money and embed themselves in British life, taking advantage of lax regulation. The days of turning a blind eye might have been replaced by what one person calls a ""choke"" strategy, but it may take time and patience for friction to erode the deep hold that Russian money has built up.

She warned of ""an extremely difficult"" stage of the war ahead, adding that casualties on the Ukrainian side were ""unavoidable"". But she ruled out any concessions from Kyiv. Meanwhile, Russian President Vladimir Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov urged Ukraine to accept ""realities on the ground"", in what is seen as a reference to the areas Moscow has seized since the start of its invasion on 24 February. The Kremlin also signalled its readiness to help alleviate a growing food crisis - but only if Western sanctions against Russia were lifted. Here are some of the main developments over the past 24 hours. Russian forces are bombarding towns and cities in eastern Ukraine with the declared aim of ""liberating"" the old industrial heartland known as Donbas. Having abandoned his campaign to capture the capital Kyiv and second city Kharkiv, President Vladimir Putin is now looking for military victory in the largely Russian-speaking east, where he falsely accuses Ukraine of committing genocide. Achieving his goals in Donbas is the minimum the Russian president needs before he could end the operation and claim it a success. Russian forces already control large swathes of the south. Ukraine says the battle for Donbas is the biggest on European soil since World War Two but its president has vowed the military ""will fight for every centimetre of our land"". Read our explainer on the importance of Donbas here. Russia relies on conscription to boost troop numbers in the armed forces. Military service lasts 12 months and, with some exceptions, is mandatory for Russian men aged between 18 and 27. After initially announcing that only professional soldiers were taking part in the operation in Ukraine, Russia later admitted that conscripts had in fact been sent across the border to fight. The BBC has spoken to one woman who discovered after making an official complaint that her two sons - both conscripts - had been sent to Ukraine. ""They allowed me to come and take my younger son home for the day,"" says Marina, which is not her real name. ""While I was driving to collect him, I called and asked him asked if there was anything he needed. 'Mum, I don't need anything,' he replied, 'just you'."" ""The lads that came back from there were so thin, dirty and exhausted. Their clothes were torn. My son said: 'It's better that you don't know what happened there.' But all that mattered to me was that he had come back alive."" Read our Russia editor Steve Rosenberg's report here. Narva is a strange place, almost an aberration. On the very edge of Nato's eastern flank, it is Estonia's third biggest city - but its population of nearly 60,000 is 97% Russian-speaking, making it the largest Russian-speaking city in the EU. It sits on the western bank of the River Narva that flows into the Baltic Sea. On the eastern bank is Russia. To a first-time visitor it feels like a classic Cold War frontier. Two giant fortresses face each other on opposing sides of the river, with the international border running down the middle. Our security correspondent Frank Gardner has been to find out how life has changed in this city on the Nato-Russia border. Read his report here. Ukrainian farmers have 20 million tonnes of grain they cannot get to international markets, and a new harvest is about to begin. What can be done to get the food to people who desperately need it, as prices soar around the world? In early February, Nadiya Stetsiuk was looking forward to a profitable year. The weather had been good in 2021 and she saw bumper harvests of corn, wheat and sunflower seeds on her small farm in Ukraine's central Cherkasy region. Prices on the international market were high and rising every day so she held on to some of her stock, to sell later. Then Russia attacked. Her region hasn't seen the worst of the fighting - like 80% of the country's farmland, it's still under Ukrainian control - but the impact on her farm has been profound. ""Since the invasion, we haven't been able to sell any grain at all. The price here is now half what it was before the war,"" says Mrs Stetsiuk. ""There might be a food crisis in Europe and the world but it's gridlock here because we can't get this food out."" Read more about how the war is affecting Ukraine's farmers. "

""I told them that they had to serve,"" Marina tells me, ""it was their duty to the motherland."" But a few weeks later she began to worry. Her sons had been deployed to an area close to the border with Ukraine. On 24 February President Vladimir Putin ordered Russian troops to invade Ukraine. That day Marina (not her real name) lost contact with her sons. ""Time stopped for me. I couldn't eat. I couldn't sleep,"" she told me. ""I exchanged messages with the mothers of other conscripts from the same unit. It turned out that many of them had lost contact with their children, too."" The Kremlin promised that Russian conscripts would not be sent to Ukraine. So where were Marina's sons? ""I got in the car and started searching. On the phone one of the commanders insisted that they were on military exercises out in the fields. I said: 'I've driven round all the fields near here where there had been exercises. They're not there. Please don't lie to me.' He hung up."" ""Once, out of desperation, I tried to drive into Ukraine. Of course, they didn't let me through. There were check-points everywhere."" ""Then the casualties started arriving. I got a call from someone telling me there were dead and wounded. I rushed to the military hospital."" Marina's sons were not there, but she was shocked by what she saw. ""In the military hospital there wasn't enough medicine or bandages. Local residents supplied everything. The soldiers were cold and hungry. Local people with a big heart were bringing food and drink to the hospital."" Eventually someone at her sons' military unit admitted that they were, indeed, in Ukraine. ""I was told the terrifying news: 'Your children have signed military contracts to be professional soldiers. They're taking part in the special military operation [in Ukraine]. They will return as heroes'."" ""What on earth are you talking about? They had no plans to sign a contract,"" was her response. ""They've been in the army for three months. They've only held a gun once. They've only been to a firing range once. Most of the time they've been shovelling snow."" ""I wrote to the prosecutor-general's office asking to investigate. I told them there was no way my sons could have signed military contracts. I was certain. Other mothers wrote, too. They all knew their children."" Russia relies on conscription to boost troop numbers in the armed forces. Military service lasts 12 months and, with some exceptions, is mandatory for Russian men aged between 18 and 27. On 5 March President Putin announced that ""only professional soldiers, officers and contract servicemen are taking part in the operation [in Ukraine]. There is not a single conscript there and we do not plan, we are not going to use them"". But just four days later the Russian defence ministry admitted, for the first time, that conscripts were among military personnel involved in the Russian offensive in Ukraine. The ministry claimed that ""virtually all such servicemen have now been returned to Russia"". A Kremlin spokesman said the president had ordered the military prosecutor's office to investigate how conscripts had turned up in Ukraine. Marina's official complaint was upheld. The Russian authorities confirmed that her sons had not signed military contracts. Both sons were returned to Russia. ""They allowed me to come and take my younger son home for the day,"" Marina says. ""While I was driving to collect him, I called and asked him if there was anything he needed. 'Mum, I don't need anything,' he replied, 'just you'."" ""When I saw him he looked a total mess. The lads that came back from there were so thin, dirty and exhausted. Their clothes were torn. My son said: 'It's better that you don't know what happened there.' But all that mattered to me was that he had come back alive."" Marina is angry about what happened. ""They lied to my face,"" she told me. ""First they lied that my sons weren't in Ukraine. Then they lied that they'd signed military contracts. Officers lied, sergeants lied. Later someone told me that they weren't allowed to tell me the truth. Incredible. They were allowed to break the law and send my sons [to Ukraine], but they weren't allowed to tell a mother where her children are."" ""I'd like to believe that our president, the commander-in-chief, just isn't aware of the mess and chaos in the army. I want to tell him that not everything here is like they say it is on television."" Marina is relieved that her conscript sons are safe. Her thoughts now are with other families. ""So many sons haven't come back and never will. So many mothers are still searching for their children. It's terrible. We're supposed to have reached the peak of human development. How come we couldn't reach agreement? Why do we have to fight and kill? ""My children were different people when they came back. You can see it in their eyes. They're different. They're disillusioned. I want them to believe again in a bright future, in peace and love. They've stopped believing."" "

Having abandoned his campaign to capture the capital Kyiv and second city Kharkiv, Vladimir Putin is now looking for military victory in the largely Russian-speaking east, where he falsely accuses Ukraine of committing genocide. Achieving his goals in the east is the minimum he needs before he could end the operation and claim it a success. Russian forces already control large swathes of the south. Ukraine says the battle for Donbas is the biggest on European soil since World War Two but its president has vowed the military ""will fight for every centimetre of our land"". When Russia's leader talks about Donbas, he is not just referring to Ukraine's coal and steel-producing area. He is highlighting two big eastern regions, Luhansk and Donetsk, which run from outside Mariupol in the south all the way to the northern border with Russia. Donbas is predominantly Russian-speaking and after Russia seized Crimea in 2014, its proxy forces captured more than a third of Ukraine's east in a war that never came to an end. The Russian proxies created so-called people's republics that nobody recognised and Russia now plans to capture the rest of the east. Luhansk and Donetsk may be broadly Russian-speaking, but they are no longer pro-Russian. One Ukrainian opinion poll in May 2022 suggested 82% of Ukrainians in territory seized by Russia since the 24 February invasion had a negative attitude to Moscow. A month into the invasion, Russia scaled back its ambitions to capture the capital, Kyiv, and instead moved its focus to Donbas. By late March it claimed to have controlled 93% of Luhansk and 54% of Donetsk, although that was certainly an overstatement. Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky declared in April that Russian forces had begun the battle for Donbas and that Ukrainian forces had long prepared for it. Russia is far from subduing the entire area, although if it captures the two big twin cities of Severodonetsk and Lysychansk, then all of Luhansk would be under its control. Just before he launched the war, President Putin recognised all of Luhansk and Donetsk as independent of Ukraine, not just the limited statelets created by Moscow-backed proxies. He has repeatedly made the unfounded accusation that Ukraine has carried out genocide in the east. The conflict there has claimed more than 14,000 lives since 2014, but three-quarters of those were combatants and the 420km line of contact didn't change significantly after 2015. As Russia's failure to capture Kyiv became clear, it switched attention to ""achieving the main goal - the liberation of Donbas"". Moscow's likely next step would be to annexe Donbas and other adjacent areas, exactly as President Putin did with Crimea after a discredited referendum in 2014. US officials believe annexation is on the cards, and Russia's puppet leader in Donetsk, Denis Pushilin, has said referendums would make sense when Russian forces complete the capture of both regions. The outside world would regard any vote as a sham, but he sees the result as ""obvious"". Russia's military is pushing forward in Luhansk and Donetsk and digging in in areas of the south, having taken control of the region of Kherson, to the north and west of Crimea, as well as part of Zaporizhzhia. Russia has already secured a land corridor from Crimea to the Russian border with the capture of Mariupol, and it has control of the water supply to Crimea as well as Europe's biggest power plant. So would victory in Donbas be sufficient for Vladimir Putin? It is impossible to know what he is thinking and what his relationship is with his military command, says Sam Cranny-Evans of the Royal United Services Institute. But if Russia is successful in Luhansk and Donetsk, then he believes Russia will assess the state of the Ukrainian forces: ""If the Russians feel that they are able to gain more of their stated goals, I suspect they will go for them."" Leading Russian figures including Security Council Secretary Nikolai Patrushev have made clear they are not chasing deadlines but are prepared for a protracted war. If they are successful in Donbas, they may have designs on extending gains in the south. Russian troops have fired missiles at the big city of Zaporizhzhia and President Putin has signed a decree making it easier for citizens in Russian-occupied areas of the south to get Russian passports. One Russian general has suggested the aim is to conquer Ukraine's Black Sea coast to the west beyond Odesa, but for now that seems little more than an aspiration. For weeks Russian forces have bombarded Severodonetsk and Lysychansk and Ukrainian forces have retreated from Lyman. They have also broken through at Popasna and are threatening key Ukrainian arterial routes and supply lines, particularly the roads from Lysychansk to Bakhmut and the major M03 motorway from Slovyansk to Bakhmut. The battle for Luhansk has entered a decisive phase, says regional military administration head Serhiy Haidai. Many of these towns have already experienced years of war since Russia's proxies first seized large parts of Donbas. Severodonetsk is normally a city of 100,000 people - 15,000 were still there, mainly in bomb shelters, as Russian troops advanced in late May. Maryna Agafonova, 27, fled her family's home in Lysychansk weeks before: ""They attacked hospitals and residential buildings,"" she said. Another big target down the M03 road is Slovyansk, a city of 125,000 people that was seized by Russian-backed forces in 2014 before being recaptured. Capturing Kramatorsk, just to the south, is also a big objective. But Russian progress has been slow and Ukrainian defence officials believe they are running low on high-precision weapons. ""This is a big territory to control, and I think we shouldn't underestimate the geographical complexities of this,"" says Tracey German, professor in conflict and security at King's College London. The Russians have already succeeded in blocking most rail traffic to the east. That was the fastest route for fleeing civilians but also the most effective transport for Ukrainian troops and heavy weaponry. Train lines in and out of Donbas have been cut and the only services remaining are going to Pokrovsk. Serhiy Haidai believes Russia's leader is now determined to capture the Luhansk region, no matter what the cost - in money, soldiers' lives or military equipment. At the start of the war, the 10 brigades that made up Ukraine's Joint Forces Operation (JFO) in the east were regarded as the best-equipped and best-trained soldiers that Ukraine has. President Zelensky revealed on 22 May that between 50 to 100 soldiers may be dying every day in their defence of eastern Ukraine. That would indicate an even larger number of wounded and Sam Cranny-Evans believes it is likely that some brigades are no longer combat effective. ""It is hard to assess whether or not they are in a good place right now. If the above attrition rates are accurate, it could be very problematic."" US officials have estimated that some 93 Russian battalion tactical groups were operating in the east, each numbering 700 to 900 men. But they too have suffered from high losses and low morale. Their units are made up of men enlisted from the local separatist areas, many under duress, as well as the broader Russian army. Russia studies analyst Michael Kofman says the military balance in the war overall weighs in Ukraine's favour, because of manpower availability and access to Western military support, but in Donbas it is too early to say how the war will go: ""Ukraine may lose territory in the short term, but Russia faces major problems with sustaining its military effort in the long term, or holding on to gains"". That is why Ukraine is calling on its Western allies to speed up deliveries of heavy weapons including long-range artillery. Life in the Russian proxy-held areas of Ukraine is far quieter than elsewhere in the east, although the so-called people's republics have accused Ukrainian forces of shelling residential buildings and killing civilians. Officials in the Donetsk statelet say dozens of civilians have died since mid-February. Far more have been killed in Russian attacks on Ukrainian-controlled territory. One woman in Luhansk told the BBC on condition of anonymity that men of military age were required to join the local Russian proxy militia, so anyone who wanted to avoid mobilisation was in hiding. People called it ""mogilisation"" after the Russian word mogila which means grave, she said. ""There are many dead and many funerals. Wives often do not know anything about the fate of their mobilised husbands."" Asked about the prospect of a vote on joining Russia, she said people understood they had no real say in the matter: ""It's like a train you can't get off."" "

Mike Haley, 61, fled the war-torn country with his wife Alla, 51, and her 81-year-old mother Valentyna. They travelled more than 2,000 miles with Pomeranian Archie, who helps Mrs Haley manage panic attacks. But the couple, now in Newcastle, said red tape over vaccination issues meant the dog could not join them. Mr Haley, originally from Jarrow, had been working as an English teacher and translator when the war started in February. The family sheltered in the corridor of their apartment for eight days - during which time Mr Haley was kicked down a flight of a stairs and his friend was shot - before they got a train out of Kyiv. After travelling via Poland to Amsterdam they sailed to North Shields with Archie, who they said helped keep their spirits up by giving them ""something else to focus on"". But on arriving in the UK, the dog was held by the Animal and Plant Health Agency, they said. Officials said although he had been microchipped and vaccinated there was a technical problem with his rabies inoculation, which happened before he was chipped, the couple said. The body, overseen by Defra, ensures animals coming in to the UK are rabies-free and Archie was given a second inoculation after he arrived. The Haleys said they were worried about whether having two doses close together would be safe because Archie is a small dog. They said he had so far been held - 240 miles away in Aberdeen - for seven weeks and they were having difficulty finding out what is going on. Mr Haley said the uncertainty was ""like torture"" for his wife and was making her sick. ""We came 2,000 miles with him,"" he said. ""He was given a clean bill of health in Holland and checked over - we'd made sure he'd had all his vaccinations. ""This little dog gave positive emotions to everybody, and then he was just taken away when we arrived. ""This is torment."" A Defra spokesman said they could not discuss individual cases but said: ""We have increased resources and streamlined processes to ensure those fleeing Ukraine and entering the UK are not delayed by bringing their pets. ""We have introduced a new rapid rabies blood test to cut quarantine times and lower-risk animals are being moved into isolation."" Follow BBC North East & Cumbria on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.

David Malpass told a US business event on Wednesday that it is difficult to ""see how we avoid a recession"". He also said that a series of coronavirus lockdowns in China is adding to concerns about a slowdown. His comments are the latest warning over the rising risk that the world economy may be set to contract. ""As we look at the global GDP... it's hard right now to see how we avoid a recession,"" Mr Malpass said, without giving a specific forecast. ""The idea of energy prices doubling is enough to trigger a recession by itself,"" he added. Last month, the World Bank cut its global economic growth forecast for this year by almost a full percentage point, to 3.2%. GDP, or Gross Domestic Product, is a measure of economic growth. It is one of the most important ways of measuring how well, or badly, an economy is performing and is closely watched by economists and central banks. It helps businesses to judge when to expand and recruit more workers or invest less and cut their workforces. Governments also use it to guide decisions on everything from tax to spending. It is a key gauge, along with inflation, for central banks when considering whether or not to raise or lower interest rates. Mr Malpass also said that many European countries were still too dependent on Russia for oil and gas. That's even as Western nations push ahead with plans to reduce their dependence on Russian energy. He also told a virtual event organised by the US Chamber of Commerce that moves by Russia to cut gas supplies could cause a ""substantial slowdown"" in the region. He said higher energy prices were already weighing on Germany, which is the biggest economy in Europe and the fourth largest in the world. Developing countries are also being affected by shortages of fertiliser, food and energy, Mr Malpass said. Mr Malpass also raised concerns about lockdowns in some of China's major cities - including the financial, manufacturing and shipping hub of Shanghai - which he said are ""still having ramifications or slowdown impacts on the world"". ""China was already going through some contraction of real estate, so the forecast of China's growth before Russia's invasion had already softened substantially for 2022,"" he said. ""Then the waves of Covid caused lockdowns which further reduced growth expectations for China,"" he added. Also on Wednesday, China's premier Li Keqiang said the world's second largest economy had been hit harder by the latest round of lockdowns than it had been at the start of the pandemic in 2020. He also called for more action by officials to restart factories after lockdowns. ""Progress is not satisfactory,"" Mr Li said. ""Some provinces are reporting that only 30% of businesses have reopened… the ratio must be raised to 80% within a short period of time."" Full or partial lockdowns were imposed in dozens of Chinese cities in March and April, including a long shutdown of Shanghai. The measures have led to a sharp slowdown in economic activity across the country. In recent weeks, official figures have shown that large parts of economy have been impacted, from manufacturers to retailers. You may also be interested in: "
155,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-61555691,2022-05-26T00:13:38,Narva: The Estonian border city where Nato and the EU meet Russia," Narva is a strange place, almost an aberration. On the very edge of Nato's eastern flank, it is Estonia's third biggest city - but 97% of the nearly 60,000 people living there talk Russian, making it one of the largest Russian-speaking places in the EU by proportion of population. It sits on the western bank of the River Narva that flows into the Baltic Sea. On the eastern bank is Russia. To a first-time visitor it feels like a classic Cold War frontier. Two giant fortresses face each other on opposing sides of the river, with the international border running down the middle. To the west is Narva Castle, built by the invading Danes in the 13th Century. To the east is Ivangorod Fortress, built by a Muscovite Grand Prince in 1492. Since much of Estonia's border with Russia crosses a lake, any future invasion by Moscow is thought likely to come either here or further to the south, next to Latvia. Spanning the river at Narva is a road bridge, flanked by a high, chain-link fence topped with barbed wire and with customs posts at either end. Here I arrange to meet Erik Liiva. He's a superintendent in the border police or, to give him his Estonian title, he's a commissar. Tall, bearded and armed, he escorts me down the road to where a single red line is painted across the road. ""You have now reached the border,"" he tells me. ""You are touching the edge of the Russian Federation."" So how are relations with your counterparts on the Russian side of the border since the Ukraine invasion, I ask. ""We don't have much contact with them,"" Liiva replies, ""but we do have a hotline for operational reasons. We have enhanced our border patrols, we are doing much more thorough checks on vehicles coming through."" It is through this obscure border post, say the Estonian border police, that thousands of Ukrainians have been streaming - many having escaped the horrors of Mariupol and other war zones. Up to 300 a day have been crossing into Estonia, most of them moving on to other countries or returning to Ukraine. In a bar in town I meet Katri Raik, the recently appointed mayor of Narva. ""Ukraine is our war,"" she says. ""We feel it here."" When the invasion began, she says, there was a tense silence in the city, nobody spoke about it. Only 47% of people here are Estonians, 36% are Russians and the rest are classed as ""aliens"" - stateless persons, mostly Russian-speaking. Before the invasion, people watched Russian programmes on TV and crossed over regularly to Ivangorod and beyond to St Petersburg, which is closer to Narva than Tallinn, the Estonian capital. But now the respective consulates in Narva and St Petersburg have closed visas are hard to come by - and Estonia has banned Russian TV programmes as they are considered to be largely Kremlin propaganda. Katri Raik, the mayor, has met many of the Ukrainians coming through her town. ""They have gone through hell,"" she says. ""It is like the light in their eyes has gone out."" In another part of town, I visit one of six volunteer aid centres set up to help the incoming Ukrainians. It is mostly staffed by young Russians and Ukrainians working for no pay - like Katya, from Russia. ""This border is the most convenient one in Europe for Ukrainians to cross over from Russia,"" she tells me. ""Some of them have been evacuated from war zones by Russian troops, some voluntarily, some forcibly. By the time they get to the border they are exhausted and traumatised."" At the Russian border post at Ivangorod, the Ukrainians are subjected to lengthy questioning - especially the men. Security officers from Russia's feared FSB security service examine their phones for photographs, social media postings and contacts, then strip-search the men, looking for tattoos of nationalist coats of arms or regimental affiliations. They even look for shoulder bruises - caused by firing weapons. The interrogations can last for hours and anyone arousing suspicion is held for further investigation. Yet some of those who have made it to the Estonian side are still critical of the West. At the volunteer centre, two elderly Ukrainian women from a village near Kharkiv eventually agree to speak to me in Russian as Katya interprets. They tell me they are grateful to the Russian soldiers who helped evacuate them to Belgorod on the Russian side of the border. Who do you blame for this war, I ask them. ""It's like a divorce,"" answers Viktoria, cradling a small dog on her lap. ""Because both sides are to blame. America is at fault as they should not have supplied weapons to Ukraine."" And what if Ukraine ends up being divided into zones ruled by Russia on one side and the legitimate government in Kyiv on the other? Where would you choose to live? ""Zelensky should not be president, he is a drug addict,"" answers Viktoria's friend, echoing the party line put out by the Kremlin. ""We would go to live in the Russian zone, of course."" Outside the centre another volunteer, Dennis, takes me aside to explain. ""It's an age thing,"" he says. ""Even here in Narva a lot of the older people blame Nato and the West for this crisis. Younger people think differently. Even those who call themselves Russian are furious with Putin for causing this mess."" Estonia - along with its Baltic neighbours Latvia, Lithuania and Poland - is seriously worried about Russia's future intentions after the Ukraine invasion. ""Europe and Nato are facing a completely new reality"" says Tuli Duneton, political director at Estonia's defence ministry. ""An attack [from Russia] can no longer be excluded."" To deter any Russian ambitions to invade these four Baltic nations, Nato has rushed in reinforcements to shore up its eastern flank - part of what it calls its ""Enhanced Forward Presence"". The UK, which leads Nato's multinational battlegroup in Estonia, has quickly doubled the size of its contingent in the country. There are now 28 Challenger 2 main battle tanks, 95 Warrior armoured vehicles and 12 AS90 artillery pieces. Not enough to stop a concerted invasion by Moscow, but enough of a deterrent to act as a ""tripwire"" that would trigger the full force of Nato should Russia ever decide to cross the border.

What can be done to get the food to people who desperately need it, as prices soar around the world? In early February, Nadiya Stetsiuk was looking forward to a profitable year. The weather had been good in 2021 and she saw bumper harvests of corn, wheat and sunflower seeds on her small farm in Ukraine's central Cherkasy region. Prices on the international market were high and rising every day so she held on to some of her stock, to sell later. Then Russia attacked. Her region hasn't seen the worst of the fighting - like 80% of the country's farmland, it's still under Ukrainian control - but the impact on her farm has been profound. ""Since the invasion, we haven't been able to sell any grain at all. The price here is now half what it was before the war,"" says Mrs Stetsiuk. ""There might be a food crisis in Europe and the world but it's gridlock here because we can't get this food out."" Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba has described as ""blackmail"" an offer from Russia to lift its blockade of Ukrainian Black Sea ports, in exchange for the lifting of sanctions. Ukraine punches far above its weight as a food exporter, contributing 42% of the sunflower oil traded on the global market, 16% of the maize and 9% of the wheat. Some countries depend heavily on it. Lebanon imports 80% of its wheat from Ukraine and India 76% of its sunflower oil. The UN's World Food Programme (WFP), which feeds people on the brink of starvation in countries such as Ethiopia, Yemen and Afghanistan, sources 40% of its wheat from the country. Even before the war, the world's food supply was precarious. Drought affected wheat and vegetable oil crops in Canada last year, and corn and soybean yields in South America. Covid had a big impact too. In Indonesia and Malaysia labour shortages meant lower harvests of palm oil, which pushed up vegetable oil prices globally. At the beginning of this year, the price of many of the world's staple foods were reaching all-time highs. Many hoped that crops from Ukraine could help make up the global shortfall. But Russia's invasion has prevented that. The Ukrainian agriculture ministry says 20 million tonnes of grain are now stuck in the country. Before the war, 90% of Ukraine's exports left via deep ports in the Black Sea, which can load tankers large enough to travel long distances - to China or India - and still make a profit. But all are now closed. Russia has seized most of Ukraine's coastline and blockaded the rest with a fleet of at least 20 vessels, including four submarines. WFP head David Beasley has called for the international community to organise a convoy to break this blockade. ""Without understanding from Russia, militarily there is so much that could go wrong,"" says Jonathan Bentham, maritime defence analyst at the International Institute for Strategic Studies. A convoy would require significant air, land and sea power, he says, and would be politically complicated. ""Ideally to keep tensions low, you'd ask countries on the Black Sea, such as Romania and Bulgaria, to do it. But they probably don't have the capability. Then you'd have to consider bringing in Nato members outside of the Black Sea."" That would put Turkey, which controls the straits into the Black Sea, in a difficult position. It has already said it will restrict entry to warships. Russia's offer to open a corridor through the Black Sea for food shipments, in return for an easing of sanctions, came as the European Union was discussing on Wednesday a fresh package of sanctions and showed no sign of changing course. Even if the war ended tomorrow it could take months or years to render the Black Sea safe, Mr Bentham says, as Ukraine has defended its coastline with mines and strategically sunken ships. For now, food can only be taken out of Ukraine over land or on barges via the Danube river. Last week, the EU announced plans to help by investing billions of euros in infrastructure. But Mrs Stetsiuk's neighbour, Kees Huizinga - who owns and farms 15,000 hectares - says it's not doing enough. He's been trying to transport goods since the start of the war, and is exasperated by the mountain of paperwork the EU requires, which he says has created queues at the border up to 25km (16 miles) long. ""It's just paper, it's not like they are actually taking samples of the corn. You just have to have the paper,"" he says. On 18 May, two days after the EU announcement, customs authorities asked his drivers for two forms that they had never seen before. ""The border is not getting easier, on the contrary it's getting more bureaucratic,"" he says. In the past three weeks Mr Huizinga has exported 150 tonnes of grain. He could get the same amount through the port of Odesa in a few hours. ""Open the borders,"" Mr Huizinga implores the EU, ""just let the stuff through."" The main route out of the country now is rail. But Ukraine's rail system is wider than the EU's, which means loads have to be transferred to new wagons at the border. The average waiting time is 16 days but it can take up to 30. Though the global conversation around food shortages is largely about wheat, most of the grain leaving Ukraine at the moment is corn. And that is for two reasons, according to Elena Neroba, Ukrainian grain analyst at the brokerage, Maxigrain. She believes Ukrainian farmers are hesitant to sell wheat because they are haunted by the memory of the Holodomor, a famine created by Stalin in 1932 in which millions of Ukrainians died. Corn, on the other hand, is not as widely eaten in Ukraine. The other factor, she says is demand. Europe doesn't buy much Ukrainian wheat, it's self-sufficient. And it's difficult to move this wheat on beyond the EU, as ports in Poland and Romania are not equipped to export large volumes of grain. ""By July, EU countries will be busy exporting their own summer harvests and will have even less capacity to handle Ukraine's food,"" Ms Neroba says. Time is running out to solve the problem. Storage facilities are full and the summer harvest of wheat, barley and rapeseed is weeks away. Mrs Stetsiuk still has about 40% of last year's harvest stored on her farm and little room for next season's. ""We don't want to waste it. We know how important it is for the West, for Africa, for Asia,"" she says. ""That's the fruit of our labour and people need it."" If she can't sell her stock, she can't afford to plant this autumn. She hopes the international community can help finance Ukrainian farmers store grain and to plant again. If they don't, she says, grain shortages next year will be even worse. Many wheat crops are in particularly bad shape right now. In Central Europe, the US, India, Pakistan and North Africa, dry weather means yields are set to be low. In Ukraine by contrast, the weather for wheat has been good. Mrs Stetsiuk started her farm with her late husband 30 years ago, as Ukraine was emerging from the ashes of the USSR. They were the first in their region to buy farmland and became a proud farming family in the process. Her two daughters and her son are all involved. ""We want to keep doing it. We want to help, providing food to the people."" In a matter of months, she says, Russia has taken them back at least 20 years. "

But reports that Russia controls a vital arterial road south-west of the city are untrue, a Ukrainian official has told the BBC. ""They can't take the city so they have decided to try to destroy it, and to make our troops leave the city,"" Luhansk regional governor Serhiy Haidai said. Russia now controls nearly all of Luhansk, one of two eastern regions that makes up Donbas. Read more about the situation on the ground here. The Ukrainian army is under more pressure than at any time since the first desperate weeks after the Russian invasion, writes the BBC's Jeremy Bowen. He's been close to the front line in Donbas, hearing from civilians caught up in the fighting. One man, Mitra, just shrugged when asked if he would accept a deal that allowed Russia to control all of Donbas. ""I don't know. What could it change for me? The main thing is to stay alive,"" he said. Read Jeremy Bowen's report here. Russia has a proud slogan: ""we don't abandon our own"". It is used to help justify Russia's invasion of Ukraine, where, according to Vladimir Putin, Russian speakers need protection from a neo-Nazi regime. But it is Ukrainian authorities, not Russian, who are trying to identify the bodies of Russian soldiers who died on the battlefields near Kyiv. Ukraine says Russia shows little interest in getting them back. ""The bodies we've found show they treat people as rubbish, as cannon fodder,"" Col Volodymyr Liamzin told the BBC. ""They don't need their soldiers. They throw them here, retreat - and leave the bodies."" But the delay in collecting bodies isn't unique to Russia, and the BBC has heard from several Ukrainian families who say their own government has been less than helpful in recovering the remains of Ukrainian soldiers from the battlefield. Russia has offered to provide safe passage to vessels carrying food from Ukraine in return for the lifting of some sanctions, according to Russia's Deputy Foreign Minister Andrei Rudenko cited by the Interfax news agency. Before the invasion, Ukraine's fertile fields provided grain to countries around the world via its ports on the Black Sea. But Russia has imposed a naval blockade, making it impossible for the grain and other important food products to leave Ukraine. The blockade is one reason for the rising food prices around the world. The West has accused the Russian military of holding food supplies hostage for millions around the world, as the BBC's Ros Atkins explains. "

""Luhansk has not been cut off,"" said the region's military administration head, Serhiy Haidai. Fighting has reached the outskirts of the big city of Severodonetsk, a key Russian target. If they capture the road to Bakhmut then the city could be surrounded. Mr Haidai said that while the route to the south-west of Severodonetsk had come under fire, humanitarian aid was still getting through. Things were far bleaker in Severodonetsk itself, which was being shelled 24 hours a day and Russian forces were close enough to use mortar rounds as well as artillery and aerial bombing, he told the BBC. Six people were killed in Russian bombardment on Tuesday, he said on his Telegram feed. If Russia captures the neighbouring town of Lysychansk then the whole Luhansk region will be in its hands. The Luhansk regional head accused Russian forces of bombarding civilian infrastructure while 15,000 civilians remained in Severodonetsk, mainly in shelters. ""They can't take the city so they have decided to try to destroy it, and to make our troops leave the city,"" Mr Haidai said. American volunteer combat medic Dallas Anthony Casey, who has helped evacuate civilians from Severodonetsk, said shelling of civilian areas was constant. ""Two days ago one of the volunteer ladies was hit when going door to door. She lost the lower half of her leg and lost a lot of blood before we could get to her. We had to do CPR, but we were unsuccessful,"" he told the BBC. Three months after Russia launched its invasion, its war aims are currently focused on seizing Ukraine's eastern regions in the industrial heartland of Donbas. Russia has sustained heavy losses on the battlefield and for the first time since the war began state TV showed President Vladimir Putin visiting casualties at a Moscow hospital. In the very brief clip filmed for a weekend TV programme, the Russian leader could be heard telling a man ""your father will be proud of you"". President Volodymyr Zelensky has described conditions in eastern Ukraine as extremely difficult while prominent Russian figures have indicated they are prepared for a protracted conflict. Security Council Secretary Nikolai Patrushev said Russia was not chasing deadlines and Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu has admitted the pace of the offensive is slowing down. The Ukrainian leader appealed to European countries to show unity in the face of Russian aggression and Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba called on the West to ""kill Russian exports"" by stopping all trade. As well as bombarding towns and cities in the east, Russia launched its biggest missile attack yet on the southern city of Zaporizhzhia at dawn on Wednesday, killing one person and damaging more than 60 homes and a shopping centre. In a clear statement of intent that Russia's long-term plans extend across the south, as well as eastern Ukraine, President Putin signed a decree making it easier for citizens in Russian-occupied areas of the south to get Russian passports. While the region of Kherson is under Russian occupation, only parts of the neighbouring region of Zaporizhzhia are in Russian hands. A Russian-appointed official in occupied Zaporizhzhia, Vladimir Rogov, declared on Wednesday that the entire region should become a fully-fledged part of Russia, rather than a so-called people's republic. Occupied areas of Donetsk and Luhansk became proxy republics after they were captured in 2014 and Russia has already handed out 800,000 passports there. "
159,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-61528087,2022-05-25T14:25:04,Prince Charles arrives in Romania to meet Ukraine refugees," The Prince of Wales has arrived in Romania to show his support for Ukrainian refugees and to see first-hand the assistance being provided. It's the first visit from a senior royal to the region since the start of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The latest figures show almost a million Ukrainians have already crossed the border into Romania. Prince Charles visited a centre near Bucharest, which supports a rising number of refugees. ""It's a nightmare situation,"" the prince said to Ukrainian families who were collecting supplies of food and clothing. He said to ""keep praying"" and told them he was ""full of admiration for the Ukrainian people - their extraordinary courage and resilience"". Aid workers explained the scale of the pressures. More than six million people have left Ukraine in the three months of the war. In the past week alone, a further 40,000 people are estimated to have crossed into Romania. Prince Charles has been strongly outspoken about the war, attacking the ""brutal aggression"" inflicted on Ukraine. Having travelled to Bucharest, about 150 miles from the Ukraine border - this is also the closest a senior British royal has come to the conflict. The prince also has a long-standing connection with Romania, having set up a charitable foundation in the country and restored a traditional farmhouse. The visit comes as figures from the UNHCR show 966,000 Ukrainians have entered Romania since the start of the war, with only Poland taking in more refugees. ""I've not seen anything so big and so fast. By any measure it's a major movement of people,"" says Mike Weickert, global rapid response director for World Vision, a charity supporting Ukrainian refugees in Romania. ""It's going to be increasingly difficult for refugees and for the hosting countries,"" said Mr Weickert, whose aid agency is working in the Romexpo centre, visited by Prince Charles and Margareta, head of Romania's royal family. The conference centre site is helping more than 1,000 people a day, with Romanian authorities and international agencies providing food, clothing and advice services. Among those helping with the international effort at the centre is Stephen Noble of the Salvation Army. He spent the pandemic helping with a food bank in Scarborough, and there are some similarities to the services being offered here, with food parcels available and racks of second-hand clothing. There are soft toys for children and pet food for the dogs and cats that some families brought with them. Mr Noble has been struck by the dignity of those arriving, who had to leave everything behind - and says that for those in the UK who have made donations it is ""absolutely worthwhile"". He says one of the most practical ways of supporting refugees has been to give them vouchers, worth about £10, to use in local supermarkets, which allows them to buy for their individual needs. One of the translators is herself a refugee. Lisa has gone from being a sales manager in Odessa to helping disorientated new arrivals. ""At first it's a shock. You don't believe it. Then you realise you have to stay."" So many people have left Ukraine that in some villages there is only one person left, she says. For those refugees continuing to stream across the border into Romania, by car, bus or train, there is still a generous reception. At Bucharest's Gara de Nord train station there are volunteers and support workers waiting to help families escaping the war. Romania has given Ukrainian refugees free travel on its railways, with women and children the great majority of new arrivals. On the station concourse there are tents ready to provide immediate shelter and first aid. This is a refugee crisis in a highly-mobile, urban setting. Many are moving on to other countries, some will try to return to Ukraine, and those that stay in Romania are mostly in the bigger cities, with spaces having to be found in hostels, private houses, public buildings or hotel rooms. As well as emergency needs, such as food and shelter, aid workers say they will need to provide longer-term support for refugees. Children will need schools, adults will need jobs to have an income, older people with health problems will need access to medical support and there will be mental health problems from such a traumatic uprooting. The longer refugees are out of their homes the more they risk ""running out money, running out of options"", says Mr Weickert. "
160,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-61571855,2022-05-25T07:42:20,Ukraine war: Bodies of dead Russian soldiers abandoned near Kyiv," When their dogs started digging insistently at a spot in the woods, villagers in Zavalivka called in the authorities. A Ukrainian military team were soon at the scene in white protective suits, carefully removing the topsoil. They uncovered a man's body, face down with his legs oddly twisted beneath him. It was clear from his uniform that he was a Russian soldier. Weeks after they failed to seize Ukraine's capital, the remains of Russian troops are still being discovered in and around the villages they passed through or occupied near the capital, Kyiv. But Ukraine says Russia shows little interest in getting them back. From the grave in the woods, the body was removed to a refrigerated train on the outskirts of Kyiv that now operates as a mobile morgue for the Russian dead. The white plastic sacks are marked with numbers rather than names and there were at least 137 stacked inside two carriages on the day we visited. The Ukrainians attempt to identify the dead: on the body just brought in, the forensics team turned up two bank cards, as well as badges for a Russian motorised rifle brigade. ""At least this one has a chance of getting home,"" the man in charge announced, displaying the finds, including a soiled fragment of T-shirt printed with the Army of Russia logo. Moments later, I confirmed that the man I had just seen exhumed had been a young, married soldier from Siberia. Next to his body bag, a carefully posed black-and-white photograph from his social media profile stared out from my phone. Russia has a proud slogan: ""We don't abandon our own."" It's a big part of President Vladimir Putin's supposed justification for invading Ukraine, where he falsely claimed Russian-speakers needed protection. That pledge appears not to apply so much to Russia's own soldiers. ""The bodies we've found show they treat people as rubbish, as cannon fodder,"" Col Volodymyr Liamzin told the BBC. ""They don't need their soldiers. They throw them here, retreat - and leave the bodies."" We don't actually know how the young soldier in the woods came to be abandoned. The villagers in Zavalivka say they were mostly hiding in their cellars from shelling at the time - they assume he was injured and got lost as his unit was forced to retreat. From what we've learned of the Russian troops fighting around Kyiv, many were young and inexperienced. It's likely they were fleeing under fire. ""We did do one swap,"" Col Liamzin says, explaining that the Russian side provided a shortlist of the dead soldiers it wanted returned. ""We're ready to give them all back, we want our own dead returned too. We knock on every door there is, but there is no response, no dialogue,"" the colonel says. The delay in collecting bodies isn't unique to Russia. Neither side in this war is open about the number of casualties suffered. We've spoken to several Ukrainian families who say their own government has been less than helpful in recovering the remains of Ukrainian soldiers from the battlefield. One woman, who was told of her husband's death by the men in his unit, said she had been trying to recover his body for almost three months. But the Russian dead are being discovered here all the time. Just up the road from Zavalivka in Sytnyaky, the village elder told us at least 10 Russian soldiers were killed and left behind in March, probably more. Their column was ambushed after they lost their way: the locals had removed and switched the traffic signs. The battle was fierce. What was once a roadside restaurant at the spot is now a heap of rubble, a bit of wall and a giant aquarium that somehow survived the assault. Leaflets in the ruins call on Russian soldiers to surrender and save their lives, and spare the blood of Ukrainian children. The village elder says he and others buried the Russians after the battle ""for sanitary reasons"". When I look quizzical, he says most were blown to pieces. He wasn't allowed to show us the graves: they constitute a crime scene until Col Liamzin's team can get round to visiting and exhuming the site. But his dig-list is already long. A local man planting beetroot confirms that the Russians were killed along the main road. ""It's not humane to abandon a soldier, not to bury them,"" Mikola says, leaning on his spade. His own son is in Ukraine's army. ""My wife felt sorry for the Russians at first, but then we found out what they did here,"" he adds, referring to the shooting of unarmed civilians in places like Bucha and Irpin. ""No-one feels sorry for the Russians after that."" The burned wrecks of Russian tanks still line all the main roads into Kyiv. Every few seconds, cars stop and families spill out to take photographs, children clambering over the top. It seems somehow cathartic. The other day, I watched a man working out by lifting a tank barrel up and down, over his head, as though he was doing weights. But that same day, just a few steps across the road, we spotted human remains on a scorched patch of verge - a charred piece of spine and a fragment of foot - and a sweet, deathly smell when the wind dropped. It was most likely one of the men killed in one of the nearby tanks. So the refrigerated train in Kyiv is still filling up, and there are more in other cities close to the fighting. For the Ukrainian military who recover and store the bodies, there is little sympathy: the dead are enemy soldiers - invaders. But in Russia, someone, somewhere must be looking for each one of them.

The US Treasury Department said it would end a waiver that had allowed US bondholders to accept payments, tightening sanctions imposed over the war in Ukraine. Russia, which is rich from its oil and gas supplies, has the funds to pay. It has already signalled plans to contest any declaration of default. The country has almost $2 billion worth of payments that will be due up to the end of the year on its international bonds. While the new rules only apply to people in the US, they will make it difficult for Russia to make payments elsewhere given the role of US banks in the global financial system. The US had already barred Russia from using US banks to transfer payments. In comments last week, US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen warned the waiver for investors was likely to expire. She said the exemption had been intended to allow an ""orderly transition"". Analysts have said they do not expect major ramifications from the move outside of Russia, with IMF chief Kristalina Georgieva saying in March that exposure to the holdings was ""not systemically relevant"". Russia's debt was already downgraded to""junk status"" by major ratings agencies in March, a move that disqualifies it from purchases by major investors, making it difficult for Russia to raise money on international markets. Professor Philip Nichols of the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania said it's not clear what Western holders of Russian bonds have done in the weeks since the invasion, whether rushing to offload them or holding on in hopes the situation will eventually normalise. A default would mark the first time Russia has failed to pay its government debt since 1998 - the economic crisis at the end of then President Yeltsin's term in office. It would likely trigger a court case, opening up Russia to recovery proceedings from creditors. Inside Russia, any impact would be felt only over the long term as part of the country's wider economic isolation, Prof Nichols said. ""Russia just has a lot of oil and gas and that translates into a lot of money, but in the long-run, this is part of a web of instruments that are designed to make it far, far more difficult for Russia to wage war on its neighbours,"" he said. ""It's going to be really interesting to see what happens,"" Prof Nichols said. "
164,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-61570444,2022-05-24T21:33:22,"Ukraine war: 'This is just the beginning, everything is still to come'"," The Ukrainian army is under more pressure than at any time since the first desperate weeks after the Russian invasion. It could be fighting a losing battle in Luhansk, the northern part of Donbas region. The Ukrainian General Staff says the Russians appear to be concentrating their forces for another push. In the last day the Russians have intensified their attacks across the Donbas front line - getting closer to completing the encirclement of Severodonetsk, a city of 80,000 before the invasion. The Ukrainians, as usual, are fighting with stubborn determination. Reinforcements are being poured into the battle. In just a few minutes I saw about 20 armoured personnel carriers, with soldiers riding on them, driving to the front line - along with tanks on transporters and multiple rocket launchers. They have slowed the Russians down but have not stopped the offensive grinding forward. The Russians are inflicting heavy casualties. A military source in the 57th Brigade told me that one of their units went into the line with 240 men and came out with about 140 - the rest of them killed, wounded and captured. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky has said the Russians could be killing up to 100 Ukrainian soldiers a day in Donbas. Not far from Severodonetsk, Bakhmut is a town getting slowly eaten by the war. This week it is about three miles from the Russians, well within range. Next week it might be much closer. Civilians with somewhere to go have left. In the ruins in Donbas, the victory in Kyiv in March - the euphoria, glory and sacrifice - feel distant. Bakhmut has been heavily shelled. Standing in front of his damaged house, a man in his 40s called Mitri showed defiance, apprehension and frustration. He had no idea what to expect in his town. ""I'm not Nostradamus. Why did Putin attack? It's all political games."" Mitri said President Zelensky's predecessor Petro Poroshenko would have reached a ceasefire agreement by now. ""At least there was peace before, they were negotiating. It's a pity about the people who died, the soldiers. It is a real shame."" It was, he said, President Zelensky's fault. He had missed an opportunity. Mitri shrugged and sucked angrily on his cigarette when I asked him if he would accept a deal that allowed Russia to control all of Donbas, compared to roughly a third of the territory it controlled before the invasion. ""I don't know. What could it change for me? The main thing is to stay alive. This is just the beginning, everything is still to come. If we survive, we'll see how it goes."" Thousands of civilians are still in Severodonetsk, as the Russians fight to encircle the last Ukrainian soldiers in the oblast of Luhansk, the northern side of Donbas. At the railway station in Pokrovsk, a safe distance from the battle, I spoke to Lida, an elderly woman who uses a wheelchair. She had just been evacuated from Severodonetsk. With other disabled and wounded civilians, she was being evacuated to the relative safety of western Ukraine on a special train, turned into an ambulance and intensive care unit by the medical organisation MSF, Doctors without Borders. Lida, who radiated defiance and cigarette smoke, was rescued by soldiers who took her and other civilians through heavily shelled areas. ""They bombed everything, we barely escaped. Glass is smashed, everything is scattered around. And I am not able to walk at all. Disabled. That's how it is. ""Nine storey buildings, the upper floors are destroyed. All ruined. ""Putin's a scoundrel. We used to live peacefully. There was a Soviet Union and so be it. They divided Ukraine and Russia. So that's why the problems began."" If President Putin's forces can encircle Severodonetsk, their next targets would most likely be the key cities of Kramatorsk and Slovyansk in the Donetsk Oblast, the other side of Donbas. Then he might declare victory in the battle for Donbas. I saw lines of freshly dug trenches near the two cities, as the Ukrainians prepared fall back positions. If they fell, and it is no certainty as they are both heavily defended, President Putin would be able to declare his first significant victory of the war. Russia would control a belt of territory stretching along its border south from Donbas and along most of Ukraine's coastline. President Zelensky says that only diplomacy can end the war, but he has said that Russia must return to the positions it held before the invasion. His allies, led by the US and UK, want to weaken Putin's Russia permanently. They have said Russia must not win. Their critics say they'll fight to the last Ukrainian. The currency of war is blood. As families bury their dead, more Ukrainians, like Mitri in Bakhmut, will question the blood price they are paying, and ask whether it is better to pay for a ceasefire with land - or lives. "

Moscow is attempting to encircle two cities in the east of Ukraine, in Luhansk. The cities, Severodonetsk and Lysychansk, straddle a key river and taking control of them would mean Russia would be closer to its goal of taking the whole of the Luhansk region. And with no sign of an end to the fighting, two senior Russian officials signalled on Tuesday that Moscow was ready for a prolonged war. ""We are not rushing to meet deadlines,"" one said. It's worth noting that while Russia invaded the country on three fronts, it has been focusing its attack on Ukraine's east for some time now. Want to know more about why it is trying to encircle the east? You can read our explainer here. That Russian advance is being met with fierce resistance. People in the southern city of Melitopol tried to block armoured vehicles and waved Ukrainian flags when the Russians arrived, the BBC's Abdujalil Abdurasulov reports. When the Russians started cracking down on the protesters, the resistance movement was forced to evolve and new groups emerged. Melitopol, according to the US-based Institute for the Study of War, is an area where partisan warfare has been active since at least the middle of March. Read more on the Ukrainian resistance here. The conflict continues to have far-reaching consequences. The world faces the worst food crisis in decades following the invasion, the UN has warned. In Asia, an agriculture expert highlighted concerns about the potential rise of ""food nationalism"". India has banned wheat exports, Indonesia has blocked overseas sales of palm oil and now Malaysia says it will cut the export of chickens from the start of June because of shortages locally. ""The government's priority is our own people,"" Malaysia's Prime Minister Ismail Sabri Yaakob said. Sonia Akter, an assistant professor at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy in Singapore, said ""food nationalism"" was the result of governments feeling that they have to ""protect their citizens first and foremost"". ""From the previous experience of the 2007-2008 food crisis, it is expected that more and more countries will follow suit, which will exacerbate the crisis as well as the food price inflation,"" she added. The war is also affecting the costs of goods in the UK - read our special report on why the cost of chicken is rising. A woman who has run a seafront hotel in Weston-super-Mare, England, for the past 60 years has closed her doors to tourists to provide a ""home from home"" for Ukrainians. Nitsa Michael, 84, who runs the Seaward Hotel, left her home in Cyprus in the 1960s before her family fled in 1974 as Turkey invaded. Based on her family's experience, she said she wanted to help Ukrainian people. Read our report in full. Since the start of the war Germany has reduced its dependence on Russian oil from 35% to 12% and on Russian gas from 55% to 35%. Nevertheless, energy trading is a huge source of revenue for Moscow. Over the first two months of the war Germany paid almost €9bn (£7.7bn; $9.6bn) for Russian oil and gas imports according to the Finnish think tank CREA. Veronika Grimm is an economics professor at the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg, and currently one of Germany's three special advisers to the federal government, called Economic Sages. ""We need to diversify and decarbonise our energy sources faster than initially planned,"" she says. To help achieve that goal, Ms Grimm wants the nation to ""ramp up"" its use of hydrogen.

Jens Stoltenberg said it had shown ""how economic relations with authoritarian regimes can create vulnerabilities"". His speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos singled out trade with Russia and China in particular. Mr Stoltenberg pointed to issues such as Russia's dominance over Europe's gas supply, as well as bids from Chinese companies to run 5G networks. ""International trade has undoubtedly brought great prosperity but we must recognise that our economic choices have consequences for our security,"" the former Norwegian prime minister told people gathered at the event. ""Freedom is more important than free trade. The protection of our values is more important than profit."" He said the fact European countries could buy as much gas as they wanted from Moscow was ""wrong"" and ""dangerous"". ""It provides Russia with a tool to intimidate and to use against us, and that has been clearly demonstrated now, I regret to say."" Europe has been accused of helping fund Moscow's war in Ukraine through its payment for energy, and is currently taking steps to reduce its reliance on Russian gas imports by two thirds by the end of 2022. Meanwhile, Russia has cut off gas and electricity supplies to Finland since it announced its ambition to join Nato. Poland and Bulgaria have also seen their gas supplies cut off after refusing to pay in Russian roubles. Mr Stoltenberg also noted that new 5G networks were part of countries' ""critical infrastructure"" and control of the networks was ""of vital security importance"". ""We cannot say that in the interest of profits and free trade we just open up those networks also for suppliers that actually are not reliable when it comes to our security,"" he said. Fears have been raised in recent years over Chinese companies' involvement in telecoms networks. The UK, US, Australia and New Zealand have already placed bans on China's biggest telecoms equipment makers getting involved in 5G networks. Canada is the latest country to announce a ban, saying last week it would help ""protect the safety and security of Canadians"". The companies have said the move is purely political. Mr Stoltenberg said he was not arguing against trade with China. "

The war has now become a ""global issue"" underscoring the importance of defending international order, he said. Japanese PM Fumio Kishida echoed his comments, saying that a similar invasion should not happen in Asia. Mr Biden was meeting the leaders of Japan, Australia and India in Tokyo in his first visit to Asia as president. The four countries known collectively as the Quad discussed security and economic concerns including China's growing influence in the region - and differences over the Russian invasion. Mr Biden's comments came a day after he warned China that it was ""flirting with danger"" over Taiwan, and vowed to protect Taiwan militarily if China attacked, appearing to contradict a long-standing US policy on the issue. It was later reported that Russian and Chinese warplanes had approached Japanese airspace as part of a joint military patrol, prompting Tokyo to announce it had scrambled jets in response. Russian officials said the flight over the Sea of Japan and East China Sea was part of an annual military exercise. Mr Kishida told a news conference that planning the exercise to coincide with today's summit was ""provocative"". In his opening remarks at Tuesday's summit, Mr Biden said their meeting was about ""democracies versus autocracies, and we have to make sure that we deliver"". The Ukraine war, he said, ""is going to affect all parts of the world"" as Russia's blockade of Ukraine grain exports aggravates a global food crisis. Mr Biden promised the US would work with allies to lead the global response, reiterating their commitment to defend international order and sovereignty ""regardless of where they were violated in the world"" and remaining a ""strong and enduring partner"" in the Indo-Pacific region. After their meeting, Mr Kishida told reporters that all four countries ""including India"" agreed on the importance of the rule of law, sovereignty and territorial integrity; and that ""unilateral attempts to change the status quo by force will never be tolerated"". India is the only Quad member that has refused to directly criticise Russia for the invasion, and, in what appeared to be a concession to Delhi, there was no mention of Russia in the joint statement issued at the end of the talks. There was also no direct reference to China or its activities, but the Quad nations announced a new maritime monitoring initiative that is expected to step up surveillance of Chinese activity in the region, along with a plan to spend at least $50bn (£40bn) on infrastructure projects and investment over the next five years. Formally referred to as the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, the Quad began as a loose grouping of countries following the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami that banded together to provide humanitarian and disaster assistance. The group fell dormant before it was resuscitated in 2017. Since then however, the top leaders have gathered four times in less than two years, meeting once in Washington last September and twice virtually. Analysts say the steady decline in each Quad nation's bilateral ties with China in the past few years appears to have given the grouping more impetus. There has been mounting discomfort with China's growing assertiveness in the region, with ongoing maritime disputes between China and several countries, and a land boundary conflict with India. Beijing's heavy investment in strengthening its navy and its recent security pact with the Solomon Islands has stoked fears in Australia, while Japan has become increasingly wary of what it calls routine ""incursions"" from the Chinese navy in its waters. On Monday, Mr Biden unveiled the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity (IPEF), a US-led trade pact aiming to promote regional growth that includes 13 countries, mostly in Asia. US Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said it would provide countries ""an alternative to China's approach"". Officials said it would set standards in the areas of trade, supply chains, clean energy and infrastructure, and tax and anti-corruption. The IPEF has been widely seen as a way for the US to re-engage with the Indo-Pacific after former US President Donald Trump's abrupt withdrawal from the Trans Pacific Partnership - a regional trade pact - in 2017.

The woman, 45, who fled Bucha, north of Kyiv, came to north-east England on 16 April but said she was asked for money and told to leave after three weeks. ""I am fleeing the war and all of a sudden I am on the street,"" she said. The government said Homes for Ukraine had helped more than 33,000 people, with very few unsuccessful cases. The mother and her 13-year-old son - whose identities are being protected - are being helped by a Sunderland-based charity and are in temporary accommodation while waiting to be matched with a new family. She told BBC Look North she thought her hosts would be kind and caring, but within weeks she ""did not feel safe or secure"". ""Our host approached us and said 'I need money',"" she said. She said the family told her: ""We spent so much money on you - look how expensive you are, look how much you have cost us - I want money."" The hosts set up an online fundraising page purported to be for the benefit of the exiled mum and son - which raised more than £850 - although the woman says she never saw any of the money. She added: ""All of a sudden I am fleeing the war and all of a sudden I am on the street."" The mother and son were offered help by charity the International Community Organisation of Sunderland (ICOS) after a local chaplain came to their aid. ""Mentally I feel better, even though we still have suitcases packed, we still don't have a place on our own but we are safe and psychologically I feel so much better,"" the mum added. Olena Davis, from ICOS, said such cases were not unique. ""She already went through a lot, she has lost her dad [while she was staying with the host family] and she has left her husband behind,"" she said. ""She travelled all the way to England and when I found out she was homeless it broke my heart and I just couldn't believe it."" A government official said ""stringent safeguarding measures"" were in place for the Homes for Ukraine scheme, including security checks, and councils must also make at least one in-person visit to a sponsor's property. A Department of Levelling Up, Housing and Communities spokesperson added: ""Thanks to the generosity of the British public more than 33,000 people have arrived through the Homes for Ukraine scheme. ""Very few sponsorships are breaking down. Where they do, councils are able to provide support or find a more suitable sponsor."" Follow BBC North East & Cumbria on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.

Mateusz Morawiecki told the BBC it was like what ""Stalin did in 1933"". In a wide-ranging interview, he also warned that ""only Putin"" would be ""happy"" with a UK-EU trade war over the Brexit deal for Northern Ireland. Ukraine's inability to export its grain has led to global food prices soaring. It has also raised the prospect of famines in the countries which depend on its exports. Mr Morawiecki said that this was ""part of [Mr Putin's] strategy"" in order to ""create ripple effects in Northern Africa and huge migration waves"". His warning was echoed by the European Commission President, Ursula von der Leyen, who told delegates in Davos that Russia was using ""hunger and grain to wield power"". ""Global co-operation is the antidote to Russia's blackmail,"" she said. Fears are rising that the Black Sea blockade is causing a global food crisis. On Monday, Ukraine's deputy Prime Minister urged the international community to create a ""safe passage"" to enable the millions of tons of grain stuck in Ukraine to leave the country. Yuliia Svyrydenko, First Deputy Prime Minister of Ukraine, told the BBC that some sort of ""corridor"" was needed. A UK government spokesperson said the country was working ""intensively"" with partners to find ways to allow grain exports to resume. However, there are ""no current plans"" for Royal Navy warships to help break Russia's blockade, the spokesperson added. Satellite images taken by Maxar Technologies have emerged purportedly showing grain shipments being moved to a Russian ship at the port of Sevastopol, Crimea. The BBC has not been able to independently verify the pictures. Mr Morawiecki said he expected an agreed EU oil embargo on Russia within days or weeks, with some carve outs for the Czechs, Slovakia, Hungary and Austria. And he called for the Nordstream One gas pipeline from Russia to Germany to be shut down this year. Mr Morawiecki said that ""Russia is under real pressure"" from existing sanctions but this would have its impact over the medium and long term. He suggested the Russian president was relying on rising energy and food prices draining support in the West for Ukraine, and politicians needed to explain and mitigate the impact on prices. ""We have to explain to the public opinion what are the consequences of the war,"" he said. ""Putin's main tool is intimidation, fear, illusions and propaganda."" On the possibility of a trade war between the UK and EU, Mr Morawiecki said it would be ""lose-lose"". ""Only Putin and our enemies will be happy with yet another disagreement between such close partner partners as the United Kingdom and the European Union,"" he said. He said there was room for compromise between Brussels and London and he was trying ""to calm down the situation between France and the United Kingdom as much as possible"". When pushed about what would happen if the UK unilaterally breaks the deal, as is currently being planned for, the Polish PM replied: ""In the current circumstances in particular, where we have such a brutal invasion, it should be a wake up call for those who want to disagree on anything. ""United, we are strong. Divided we are very weak."" But the Polish PM also had some criticism for his EU colleagues. Asked if he was worried about noises emerging from Paris and Berlin about compromise with Russia, he pointedly replied: ""Some Western European leaders wanted to have cheap, natural resources and peace. And what they got is very expensive raw materials and natural resources and war. ""So they should bear in mind that Putin is first working to divide us and second to make us impatient and make us tired with everything."" Mr Morawiecki added that, as with other wars, including the Second World War, ""we have to be prepared for a long war, unfortunately, and we have to make public opinion knowledgeable about what is going on in Ukraine"".

Condemning Vladimir Putin's war as stupid, he said it was ""like your courts, built entirely on lies"". Navalny was already serving a jail term when he was convicted in a fraud case rejected by supporters as fabricated. He addressed the court in Moscow via a video link at his penal colony. Long seen as a President Putin's most vocal critic in Russia, Navalny was detained the moment he flew home from Germany after treatment for a near-fatal nerve agent attack in Siberia in August 2020. He was initially jailed for two and a half years for breaking bail conditions while being treated in hospital, but in March he was given an extra nine years for fraud and contempt of court. The prosecutor told the court the verdict in March had been fair and justified but Navalny's defence lawyer argued it had contradicted international law. In comments that were repeatedly interrupted, Navalny said he despised the court and said the rulings against him were no different from the lies used by ""madman"" President Putin and state TV to justify the war. ""You will suffer a historic defeat in this stupid war that you started. It has no purpose or meaning. Why are we fighting a war?"" he said. Russia has silenced criticism of its three-month war in Ukraine, prosecuting dozens of people who have refused to use the term ""special military operation"" and blocking independent media outlets. During Tuesday's appeal hearing, Navalny told the court that the judge who gave him his initial jail term in February 2021, Natalya Repnikova, had later told his lawyers she regretted her decision. Repnikova died months later of coronavirus ""according to the official version"", he reportedly told the court. Since Navalny was jailed last year he has been held in a jail at Pokrov, east of Moscow, but he now faces being transferred to a penal colony with a far stricter regime and very limited rights to prison visits. His colleagues say he is due to be moved to a facility in Melekhovo, where one former prisoner has made allegations of systematic torture. "
171,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-61466479,2022-05-24T10:05:39,Why chicken is getting more and more expensive," Chicken is the UK's meat of choice for the dinner table, but consumers might have noticed the numbers ticking up on their receipts. With the cost of chicken feed, energy and transport increasing, fast food chains like Nando's and KFC have already put some prices up. The boss of Co-op supermarkets has warned poultry could become as expensive as beef, while official figures suggest that the price of chilled, oven-ready, chicken has increased from £2.50 to £3 per kg in the last two years. ""The problem we have is that all kinds of prices are going up and up,"" says poultry farmer James Mottershead. His family bought the West Midlands farm in 2001. In recent years, demand has grown and the business now raises about 1.5 million chickens a year. We follow the production process step-by-step to see where costs are mounting for poultry farmers and processors. Poultry makes up 50% of the meat eaten in the UK and one billion birds are reared in the country every year, according to the British Poultry Council. Mr Mottershead, who is also the chair of the poultry board at the National Farmers' Union, receives deliveries of about 215,000 chicks in seven ""cycles"" each year. The broiler chickens, raised specifically for meat, arrive at the farm at one day old. The price for the chicks has gone up by 5p over the last year though, with the cost now topping 40p per bird, Mr Mottershead says. Hatcheries have come under pressure as costs for feed, electricity and heating for the incubation period have gone up, and those are being passed on to farms. Mr Mottershead and two dedicated full-time employees look after the chicks that are then grown in dedicated poultry sheds. Day-to-day costs are going up there too. Staff start on-site at 07:00, checking water consumption and feed availability, as well as on the birds' health. All of the birds on the farm are sold as Red Tractor assured, which means each chicken can be traced back to the hatchery it came from and it has 10% more space than is required by European legislation. The farm generates renewable energy. The commercial sheds use LED lights and have solar panels on the roof. Despite that, Mr Mottershead says electricity prices have ""rocketed"" in the last year, with the cost per kilowatt roughly doubling. Some of the sheds also have LPG gas containers for heating. Prices now top 40p per litre, up from 15p two years ago - driven higher by Russia's invasion of Ukraine and worries about the impact the conflict could have on supplies from one of the world's biggest gas exporters. The farm uses borehole water, but the cost of chemicals used to sanitise the water has risen by about 30%. The business also goes through about 200 tonnes of wood shavings for the chick's bedding each year. The cost of buying that in bulk has jumped by about 40% in the last 12 months. Aside from wood shavings to scratch, the cost of feed, which makes up a large proportion of a poultry farmer's budget, is soaring. The farm's spend on it now stands at about £2m a year. Different types of feed ingredients are used depending on the chicken's stage in its life cycle - whether that's a chick crumb or a grower pellet for later on. Kynan Massey, managing director of Massey Bros feed firm, told the BBC ""prices had never been higher"". It's because the feed is often made up of wheat or soya, which have seen prices spike due to failed harvests last summer and the conflict in Ukraine. ""Russia and Ukraine are responsible for a quarter of wheat exported around the world,"" Mr Massey says. ""If conflict continues we could see prices carrying on rising, and in Europe the dry weather is affecting costs as well."" In the poultry sheds, the birds' weight is monitored regularly. The number of birds is reduced at 32 days once they have reached their target weight to ensure the farm is meeting rules on density per square metre. About a third of birds in the shed are sent to the abattoir then, with the rest of the chickens removed at 39 days. They are transported by truck in crates. Of course, the cost of fuel has also gone up. UK diesel prices, for example, rose to a record of just over £1.80 a litre on Monday, according to the RAC. After the previous record of £1.79 in March following the invasion of Ukraine, prices dipped but have risen again in recent weeks. And it's been more difficult to find a lorry driver. The shortage has been blamed on a combination of factors, including the pandemic, Brexit and tax changes. Wages have soared as a result, with annual salaries offered by some haulage firms reaching £80,000. ""The reality is that when you have a shortage, people can name their prices,"" Mr Mottershead says. In UK processing plants, most chickens are now killed using gas - usually carbon dioxide, a by-product from the fertiliser production process. Gas prices were already going up last year, forcing big fertiliser factories in the UK to suspend production. Although the UK produces about half of its own fertiliser, costs have been driven up more because of conflict further afield. Russia is a huge producer of the key ingredients needed for fertiliser, like ammonia, so fears over supplies have a knock-on effect on CO2 prices. 2 Sisters, one of the UK's biggest chicken suppliers, told the BBC it had seen the cost of CO2 nearly quadruple. After the chickens are killed, they are defeathered, cleaned and packaged by agricultural workers. 2 Sisters says the cost of card packaging has also gone up by 20% in recent months. Producers are spending more on labour in the plants due to an increase in the National Minimum Wage as well. Others are offering higher salaries to attract workers amid ongoing labour shortages. Eventually, the packaged chicken will be sold to clients like butchers, corner-shop chains, manufacturers or supermarkets. But Ronald Kers, the boss 2 Sisters, has said input costs before this point have rocketed. ""Prices from the farm gate have already risen by almost 50% in a year,"" the company which has 600 farms and 16 factories across the UK, said previously. It warned the days of lower prices are coming to an end. Mr Mottershead points out that although some poultry producers are struggling, supermarkets are hesitant to pass on costs to their customers as the cost of living increases. ""We're doing all we can to produce quality chicken and egg products, but there's a huge amount of farmers who won't be able to restock their sheds because that cost is too great,"" he says. Russia's war in Ukraine has made existing shortages ""even worse"", he suggests. For poorer families and countries, ""the realities of this don't bear thinking about"". "

Dmytro Mikhai and Dasha Kutanova are living in Nettlebed with the family of Team GB rower and former captain of Henley's Leander Club Jack Beaumont. Mr Beaumont contacted his friend and former competitor to offer his help after the Russian invasion. ""We are very grateful to Jack,"" Mr Mikhai told the BBC. Under the government's Homes for Ukraine scheme, the couple are living with Mr Beaumont's father Peter Beaumont and stepmother Eira Parry in the Oxfordshire village. Mr Mikhai has been able to continue his training at Leander Club and Ms Kutanova has got a job working in a local cafe. Mr Mikhai said: ""We are very grateful to Jack for introducing us to his family, and to Eira and Peter for their generosity in sharing their home with us. ""Leaving our home and family in Ukraine has been so hard, but they have helped us to settle in to the community and to navigate all the complexities of starting a life in the UK, like opening bank accounts, finding work and applying for a longer term residency permit. ""The community in Nettlebed and Henley have been so welcoming, we feel like we make friends everywhere we go."" He said while the couple love living with their hosts, they worry about having a newborn in someone else's home. ""We would really like to find an apartment nearby where we can start our family life with our new baby, but still be close to our Homes for Ukraine sponsors and our new friends in the area,"" he added. When Russia launched its invasion, Mr Mikhai was at a rowing training camp in Turkey while Ms Kutanova was staying with her mother in Kherson in southern Ukraine - the first city seized by Russian troops. The women spent days locked in the bathroom of their apartment because of the constant shelling. Ms Kutanova eventually managed to flee in a car with a friend. They put a basket of vegetables on the back seat and at every roadblock told the Russian soldiers they were delivering food to the next village. Making their way along roads they knew were mined, they eventually made it to the port city of Odessa where they got a boat to Romania before driving to Turkey to meet up with their husbands.

Iryna Basaraba gave birth less than two weeks after arriving in Dromore, County Down. It is believed to be one of the first babies born to a Ukrainian refugee in Northern Ireland. At 30 weeks pregnant, she drove her five-year-old son, teenage sister and mother from Lviv to Poland. Speaking to BBC News NI's Good Morning Ulster programme, Ms Basaraba said it was a necessary decision. ""We didn't know what would happen the next minute, the next hour. It was very hard because we didn't know what would happen in the future. ""I'm happy I gave birth to my baby here."" She said she was trying to focus on baby Victoria, named after victory for Ukraine. ""I think it's better for me and the baby to be relaxed rather than think about what is happening in Ukraine - I try to not read a lot of the news,"" she said. ""I would like to go back to Ukraine as soon as it is possible and it will be safe."" While she has her mum and sister with her in Dromore, she said it was difficult to be separated from her husband who stayed in touch with her and the new baby over WhatsApp. ""It is very difficult to be away from him because we were always together and now, not,"" she said. Speaking about the birth at Craigavon Area Hospital's maternity unit, she said she had a positive experience. ""They looked after me the whole time during the labour, and I'm happy that I gave birth to my baby here,"" she said. Wallace and Margaret Pepper from Dromore are hosting the family under the Homes for Ukraine scheme. Mr Pepper said it was a privilege. ""It's the very least we can do to share what we have with people who have been traumatised by the invasion and the war in Ukraine,"" he said. ""It'll be terrific to go and see Victoria when she is a young girl, a young lady, and just to know that we have been part of her development and her life."" Mrs Pepper says having a new born in the house was ""absolutely wonderful"". ""She's the best child in the whole world,"" she said. ""She suckles and sleeps.

""I actually saw a woman on the news and I just thought that could be my mum,"" she said. ""It was just devastating, I couldn't stand by and watch."" She travelled to Poland independently but is now managing an eight-strong team of aid workers from across the world called The International Humanitarian Support Team. As well as helping Ukrainians fleeing the invasion, Ms Shanks' group are making regular journeys into Ukraine to deliver supplies to those left behind. She said she has seen the widespread destruction caused by missile strikes and came close to being hit while on a trip to the city of Lviv. ""Putin is just destroying everywhere and causing so much devastation,"" she said. Ms Shanks is being cautious about who she speaks to amid fears Russian spies might be leaking information which could put aid workers in peril. The BBC has decided not to reveal where in Poland her group is based. ""I don't think anybody feels safe but if we don't do it, that is what Putin is trying to achieve, to scare aid workers to not get aid to the front line,"" she said She has seen and heard many stories of loss among the Ukrainians, including one woman who had to leave her 100-year-old mother behind which was ""just devastating"". She said the circumstances were heart-breaking: ""Mentally you've got to try and push things down because otherwise everything is going to go to pot."" She said she felt ""quite emotional"" about the ""most lovely"" people of Ukraine, adding: ""These people are hard working, polite, very caring. ""Anyone of them could be you or I. ""I don't know where they find the strength but they've got no choice have they?"" Follow BBC North East & Cumbria on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.

Locals tried to block armoured vehicles as the convoy of soldiers rolled in to occupy the city, and people flooded the streets waving Ukrainian flags. When the Russians started cracking down on the protesters, the resistance movement was forced to evolve and new groups emerged. Melitopol, according to the US-based Institute for the Study of War, is an area where partisan warfare has been active since at least the middle of March. Ukraine's Military Intelligence Directorate has reported that from 20 March to 12 April ""partisans eliminated 70 Russian soldiers during their night patrol"". These groups are continuing to carry out attacks. Last Wednesday a Russian armoured train was reportedly derailed. Days earlier, two Russian soldiers were found dead in the street. Last month a bridge near Melitopol - used to deliver supplies to the Russian army - was blown up. Ivan Fedorov, the mayor of Melitopol, says these attacks were organised by partisan groups. ""It's the job of our partisans, our secret services and our soldiers. They do this job together,"" he tells the BBC. Mr Fedorov himself was abducted by Russian forces and later released as part of a prisoner exchange. The Russians are desperately trying to crush all resistance. They are searching houses and detaining people, residents say, often at random. On 29 April, armed men in military uniform with white armbands - the marking used by Russian soldiers - abducted Boris Kleshev, the head of a local fire brigade in Melitopol. For two weeks his relatives heard nothing about his whereabouts. A few days ago, a pro-Russian Telegram channel posted a video showing Mr Kleshev and other Ukrainian men admitting that they were sharing information on Russian movements with the Ukrainian military. Mr Kleshev was speaking with a low voice, clearly under duress. But even if it looked like a forced confession, those who made the video were unlikely to have cared - their aim is to break the resistance spreading through Melitopol. These resistance groups, however, are only a small part of the movement. ""Ninety per cent of Melitopol residents are now partisans and they resist in their own way,"" says Svitlana Zalizetska, a local journalist. ""Some people just stare at the Russian soldiers with hatred. Others sing patriotic songs at night. Some people hang posters in the street with Ukrainian flags,"" she says, adding that some also pass on information about Russian military movements. At the start of the invasion in February, Melitopol residents organised mass protests against the Russian army's presence. People regularly took to the streets with Ukrainian flags, chanting: ""Melitopol is Ukraine."" ""Russian forces were truly shocked to see that the local population was not happy to see them. Those soldiers really believed that they were liberators,"" says Iryna (not her real name), who lives in Melitopol. A few weeks after the invasion, police from Rosgvardia - Russia's national guard - arrived to crack down on the protests. They started dispersing crowds and detaining activists. But Russian troops appear to understand that defeating the resistance here requires more than just stopping the rallies. Unlike other regions occupied by Russian forces, the military in Melitopol have been trying to win people's hearts and minds. ""We have the brand of 'polite people'"", Iryna jokes, referring to the term used to describe Russian soldiers when Moscow annexed Crimea in 2014. ""These are ordinary guys who look like us and try to be nice,"" she explains. ""They help elderly women and show that they care about people. But they can't realise that it was them who created all these troubles and that our people didn't beg for help before."" In order to create a perception of normality, the Russian forces try to silence anyone who openly opposes them. Svitlana Zalizetska, who used to run a popular news website, was pressured to co-operate with the new authorities appointed by the Russian military. She refused. When the mayor, Mr Fedorov, was abducted, Svitlana realised she could be next. She later escaped into territory controlled by Ukrainian forces. Then, Russian officers started threatening her family. ""First they wanted to destroy the website. They failed,"" she says. ""Then they tried to capture me. They failed again. Then they detained my father and took him hostage to make me come back, and gain control over the website."" Only when she publicly acknowledged that she no longer owned the website and stopped writing for it, they released her father. The Russian army is mobilising resources to change the pro-Ukrainian views of the population in Melitopol. They desperately want to get schools, shops and businesses to reopen with the aim of presenting Russian rule as a positive step. And the longer the occupation lasts, the harder it is for people to resist. Some residents, with no funds left to feed their families, are returning to work - even if it implies supporting the new Russian regime. ""If they are physically killing Ukrainians in Mariupol, here they're trying to break our souls,"" says Iryna. ""But they will fail."" "
177,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-61547082,2022-05-24T00:10:11,Quad: The China factor at the heart of the summit," Leaders of the Quad nations are meeting in Tokyo on Tuesday in what can be described as one of the most important meetings in recent years that will affect the geopolitics and security of the Indo-Pacific region. The group - composed of Japan, the US, Australia and India - seems to be emerging from the shadows of the Covid-19 pandemic and, to some degree, from Russia's invasion of Ukraine as well. The top leaders are gathering for the fourth time - they have already met once in Washington last September and twice virtually - in less than two years. That underscores the importance of the Quad, which was largely just a concept until 2017. That year, then-US President Donald Trump revived the group in a bid to take on China in its own backyard. But analysts say the steady decline in each Quad nation's bilateral ties with China in the past few years appears to have given it new impetus. Michael Kugelman, deputy director at the Wilson Center think-tank, says the latest meeting is likely to sharply focus on the Indo-Pacific. ""With the pandemic in the rear-view mirror and an understanding over India's stand on Ukraine, the Quad will get down to focusing on its core business of ensuring an open and free Indo-Pacific,"" he says. India has so far refused to directly criticise Russia over its war in Ukraine but it has reiterated the importance of respecting the sovereignty of each nation. After initial anger against India's stand, the US and other Western countries seem to have understood Delhi's position. The 2+2 Dialogue - attended by the foreign and defence ministers of the US and India - in April helped smooth their differences over Ukraine. The US has acknowledged that India's heavy dependence on Russia for its defence imports could not be overlooked. So the Quad will focus on mutual points of convergence - and China is the biggest of these. China has become increasingly assertive in the region, with ongoing maritime disputes with several countries and a land boundary conflict with India. Beijing is investing heavily in strengthening its navy and its recent security pact with the Solomon Islands has stoked fears in Australia. A leaked draft of the agreement - which was verified by the Australian government - said Chinese warships would be permitted to dock on the islands and that Beijing could send security forces ""to assist in maintaining social order"". It will be interesting to see how Anthony Albanese, Australia's newly elected PM, deals with this threat and how he raises the issue within the Quad framework. Japan, for its part, has become increasingly wary of what it calls routine ""incursions"" from the Chinese navy. As for the US, it is evident that it wants to protect its interests in the region. The launch of the US-led Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF), which has 13 regional players, is a step in that direction. It aims to promote regional growth, sustainability and inclusivity in the region. It comes on the back of US President Joe Biden's recent meeting with the Association of South East Asian Nations (Asean) leaders in Washington. The region's importance can be understood from the fact that it has some of the world's most heavily used shipping lanes, including the Strait of Malacca. Around 30-40% of the world's trade, including goods and crude oil, passes through these lanes. So when Indian PM Narendra Modi, Mr Biden, Mr Albanese and Japanese PM Fumio Kishida meet in Tokyo, they may not mention China directly - but regional security will be on top of their agenda. The Quad has several working groups, including on cybersecurity, health, infrastructure and education, but it has not explicitly spoken about any defence co-operation. However, it's likely to announce a joint strategy to tackle illegal fishing in the Indo-Pacific region - which analysts say is largely aimed at China. Mr Kugelman says this announcement would be quite significant because it involves the use of satellite imagery and active intelligence sharing - which will have security implications. But he adds that the group will need to do a lot more before Asean nations see it as a major counterbalance to China. It's not that there is no defence angle to the Quad. The four countries, and a few others, have taken part in India's Malabar naval exercises, and issues such as Afghanistan and North Korea's nuclear programme have been discussed at the Quad. Mr Biden recently warned China that the US would intervene militarily to protect the island if it is attacked. But Mr Kugelman points out that both Asean and Quad nations have significant trading volumes with China and they will try to avoid any direct confrontation with Beijing - at least until the Quad can emerge as a net security provider in the region. Moreover, Delhi is a partner with Beijing in several multilateral forums, including Brics - which also includes Russia, South Africa and Brazil. ""The Quad has come a long way but it still has an informal structure and has no secretariat. So, it needs to keep evolving,"" Mr Kugelman says. Meanwhile, Russia's growing ties with China will most likely feature as well as they don't suit Delhi's geopolitical calculations. Some analysts have predicted that the Ukraine war may ""send Russia into China's arms"" and Beijing might be able to persuade Moscow to increase its presence in the Indo-Pacific. If that happens, it will upset Delhi's interests the most as it has close ties with Russia and an ongoing dispute with China. It's just a scenario at the moment, Mr Kugelman says, but one that can't be completely overruled, especially since Russia has been quite critical of the Quad. Beijing's initial reaction to the Quad was to dismiss it, saying the group would ""dissipate like sea foam"". But it later sharpened its criticism of the group, calling it the ""Asian Nato"". On Sunday, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said the Quad was formed ""to contain China"". With such hardening of positions from both sides, Asean nations - some of whom have active maritime disputes with China - may find themselves between what one analyst called ""a rock and a hard place"".

It is the highest-profile resignation over the war yet from a Moscow official, and came on the same day a Kyiv court found a Russian tank commander guilty of war crimes. Meanwhile in Ukraine's eastern Donbas region Russian forces have been intensifying their attacks on the city of Severodonetsk. Boris Bondarev walked away from his 20-year career in the Russian foreign service on Monday, publishing a scathing statement which criticised both the war and his former employer. In the letter, the 41-year-old said the ""bloody, witless"" war had been ""unleashed by Putin"" and was designed to keep those behind it ""in power forever"" - whatever the cost. Mr Bondarev is one of few to speak out in such a public way, and has been cheered on by people like Kira Yarmysh, the spokesperson for the jailed Russian opposition figure Alexei Navalny. But he told the BBC he did not think many of his colleagues would follow his lead. Instead, he said, many of them had welcomed the war. Read more here. Tank commander Sgt Vadim Shishimarin became the first Russian soldier to be convicted in Ukraine for a war crime relating to the invasion. Shishimarin was jailed for life by a court in Kyiv which found he had shot dead a civilian in the early days of the invasion back in February. The captured soldier admitted killing Oleksandr Shelipov, 62, in the north-eastern village of Chupakhivka but said he had been following orders. In a conflict where the deliberate targeting of civilians has become a recurring accusation, the verdict sets a significant legal precedent. Moscow has always denied its troops have targeted civilians, despite a wealth of evidence to the contrary, while Ukraine says more than 11,000 crimes may have occurred. Since Russian President Vladimir Putin sent troops into Ukraine on 24 February, at least 3,838 civilians have been killed and 4,351 injured, according to the United Nations. As the court delivered its verdict in Ukraine's capital, the country's east was coming under intensifying attacks from Russian forces. The city of Severodonetsk, the largest one under Ukrainian control in the Luhansk province, was targeted by Russian artillery and missile fire. Moscow is trying to capture the city and yesterday officials claim they repelled Russian forces trying to enter it from four different directions. UK defence officials say capturing the city of 100,000 is one of Moscow's ""immediate tactical priorities."" Lilia Yapparova is an independent Russian journalist who could face years in prison for covering the invasion as she sees it. Right now she is reporting from Kyiv, but a return to Russia could mean criminal prosecution for failing to toe the official Kremlin line on the war. ""The only thing that matters for me right now is for the war to stop and for people from Russia to see what's really going on,"" she told the BBC's Sarah Rainsford. She risks joining the dozens of Russians who have already been prosecuted under Moscow's draconian ""fake news"" law. Thousands of kilometres away in Wales, some Ukrainian families have said that strict quarantine rules for pets are making it harder for them to settle into their new lives. Under Welsh rules, many animals brought into the country have to stay in a quarantine centre for up to four months. The government in Cardiff says it is trying to reduce the risk of rabies, but elsewhere in the UK animals can quarantine at home after health checks. ""We love Wales and our host family but half of our family isn't here,"" said Larysa Martseva - who's two Rhodesian Ridgebacks have been in kennels since their arrival from Ukraine on 26 April. "

The family of five are in Romania waiting on their visas. Kilbride Presbyterian Church in Ballyclare, County Antrim is sponsoring six refugee families. Its minister Reverend Gareth McFadden said he was ""embarrassed"" by the ""impossible"" request. The family of two adults and three children have been told they will have to travel across Romania to the capital to get biometrics for their 10-month-old son. Rev McFadden said they were ""stuck"" as it is an ""impossibly difficult journey"" for them to make. ""They have a 10-month-old child who doesn't have a full international passport. He requires biometrics, and we've got the specific messages requiring him to travel to get those,"" the minister explained. ""That would require that family taking a 1000km journey to Bucharest, to get fingerprinting done on the 10-month-old so that they could enter into the UK, we are finding that frustrating."" He said the sponsor family had asked the government to waive the requirement for the baby to get his fingerprints taken before he arrived. ""We're not asking for the government rules to be abandoned, but a level of considered humanitarian flexibility. ""We would ensure the biometrics are done upon arrival here in Northern Ireland. ""We're embarrassed, we're sad, we grieve for them."" Fiona Eatock and her husband Martin, both members of the congregation, have been preparing to welcome the family into their home. They first applied for visas, for all five family members, four weeks ago, but so far only two have been processed. ""It's quite frustrating and a prolonged wait. We're just anxious for them, they just want to get to Northern Ireland so they can get settled and get the children into school. ""I think they deserve some safety and security and a place that they can call home."" A government spokesperson said applications could ""differ in their complexity"" and ""robust safeguarding"" was needed to protect children. ""We thank faith and community groups for their vital support in bringing people together. In as little as two months we have issued over 107,400 visas, helping Ukrainians displaced from their home country to find safety in the UK. ""All applications from families are normally processed together, but cases differ in complexity and it is vital that robust safeguarding processes are in place to protect children from trafficking and other risks.""

Boris Bondarev, whose LinkedIn says he worked at the Russian mission to the UN in Geneva, told the BBC he knew his decision to speak out may mean the Kremlin now considers him a traitor. But he stood by his statement which described the war as ""a crime against the Ukrainian people"" and ""the people of Russia"". Moscow has not yet commented. Russia has cracked down on those who are critical of or veer from the official narrative surrounding the war, which it refers to only as ""a special military operation"". In the letter posted on social media and shared with fellow diplomats, Mr Bondarev explained he had chosen to end his 20-year career in the service because he could no ""longer share in this bloody, witless and absolutely needless ignominy"". ""Those who conceived of this war want only one thing - to stay in power forever,"" he wrote. ""To achieve that, they are willing to sacrifice as many lives as it takes,"" he continued. ""Thousands of Russians and Ukrainians have already died just for this."" The letter does not hold back over his former employer either, accusing Russia's Foreign Ministry of being more interested in ""lies and hatred"" than diplomacy. As resignation letters go, this one was scathing. Diplomat Boris Bondarev didn't hold back in his criticism of President Putin, Foreign Minister Lavrov and the Russian offensive in Ukraine. ""The aggressive war… the most serious crime… warmongering, lies and hatred…"" It's rare to hear such words from a Russian official. In the three months since Vladimir Putin launched what he's still calling his ""special military operation"" in Ukraine (what most of the world calls Russia's war) there have been few signs of open dissent in Russian state institutions. Embarrassing for the Russian authorities? Absolutely. They like to make out that the state machine here is fully behind President Putin's decision to invade Ukraine. But one resignation does not automatically mean that many more will follow. Mr Bondarev admitted to me that he's in the minority. He believes that, for now, most officials in the Russian Foreign Ministry back the official line and support the Kremlin's 'special operation.' Speaking to the BBC, Mr Bondarev said he had ""not seen any alternative"" than to resign: ""I don't think it will change a lot, frankly, but I think it may be one little brick into the bigger wall which would eventually be built. I hope so."" Mr Bondarev revealed that the invasion had initially been met by colleagues with ""happiness, delight, euphoria"" at the fact Russia had ""taken some radical steps"". ""Now they're less happy with that, because we're facing some problems, with the economy first of all,"" he told the BBC. ""But I don't see that many of them would repent and change their views. ""They may become a little bit less radical, less aggressive quite a bit. But not peaceful.,"" he said. In contrast, Mr Bondarev said in his open letter he had ""never been so ashamed of my country"" as he was on 24 February, the day the invasion began. It is unclear if he is the first diplomat to resign from the mission, although no one else has spoken out publicly. Mr Bondarev is under no illusions that Moscow will now see him as a traitor, but notes he hasn't ""done anything illegal"". ""I just resigned and spoke my mind,"" he said. ""But I think I have to be concerned about my safety of course."" "

The coffee chain will now retreat entirely from the Russian market, after suspending trading there in March. It said it would continue to pay nearly 2,000 staff working at its shops in the country for six months. Starbucks joins firms such as McDonald's and Renault in permanently exiting the country. US and Western allies responded to the war by hitting Russia with wide ranging economic sanctions aimed at isolating it economically and cutting it off from the global financial system. The rules make it difficult for Western companies to operate there. Starbucks entered Russia in 2007 and had grown to include 130 coffee shops, owned and operated by a licensee. The company had stopped shipments to Russia in March. It said it had now ""made the decision to exit and no longer have a brand presence in the market"". It did not give details of the financial impact of the decision, but said it would provide assistance to its staff ""to transition to new opportunities outside of Starbucks"". A spokeswoman for Starbucks said the stores would close. The Kuwait-based Alshaya Group, which owns and operates the Starbucks stores, said the decision to leave was a ""Starbucks announcement"" and referred questions to the coffee chain. It did not say whether it would seek to sell its stores or reopen under a new brand. Last week, McDonald's announced that it was selling its nearly 850 restaurants in Russia to a current licensee, Russian businessman Alexander Govor, who is expected to rebrand the restaurants. Earlier this month, French carmaker Renault also said its business had been nationalised and would be run by Russian government entities, who said they hoped to revive production under a Soviet-era car brand. The mayor of Moscow last month estimated that about 200,000 people in that city alone risked losing their jobs as Western companies left the country. "
182,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-61548029,2022-05-23T14:52:01,Ukraine calls for safe passage for grain exports," The international community should help create a ""safe passage"" to enable the millions of tons of grain stuck in Ukraine to leave the country, its deputy PM has said. Yuliia Svyrydenko, First Deputy Prime Minister of Ukraine, told the BBC that some sort of ""corridor"" was needed. Ukraine's inability to export its grain has led to global food prices soaring. It has also raised the prospect of famines in the countries which depend on its exports. Ms Svyrydenko, who is also Ukraine's Minister of the Economy, urged the international community to help lift the blockade of the country's sea ports. She said this could be a ""solution"" allowing Ukraine to export the grain currently stuck in its silos and unable to be shipped. ""We need the assistance of our international partners, to secure our exports through the sea ports... to find a way to build a corridor, or another solution, how to give an opportunity to Ukrainian vessels [to export via the Black Sea],"" she said. ""A safe passage."" She hinted that military means might be necessary to achieve this. ""We need a guarantee from partners, of course it's a defence guarantee, a security guarantee, to be able to export [using] these vessels,"" Ms Svyrydenko said. ""And to make it, not once but on a regular basis. That is most important."" Ukraine's wheat exports plunged after the Russian invasion. As wheat prices soared on world commodity markets, the cost of everything from bread and cakes to noodles and pasta has gone up. Ukraine is able to export small quantities of its commodities by river, rail and barges on the Danube river. But Ms Svyrydenko warned those routes are insufficient. ""I think if you calculate it would take us five, six, seven years to export all these agricultural yields by these routes. So right now it's extremely important for us to unblock the seaports and we apply to our partners to do this,"" she said. ""The world needs it because Russia threatens the world with world hunger and the only way to solve this problem is to unblock the sea ports. ""If we don't give farmers the opportunity to export their goods, for them there won't be any sense in going to the next growing season,"" she continued. Another item on the agenda, was how to make use of assets affected by international sanctions, Ms Svyrydenko said. Ukraine made clear in March that it believed the assets belonging to Russian oligarchs and Russian central bank funds that have been frozen should be used to finance the rebuilding of Ukraine. ""We should take them and [use] them for the reconstruction of Ukraine,"" she said. ""Otherwise what was the sense in freezing those assets, if no Ukrainian [would] receive them?"" ""We just need to find a clear procedure for how to get these funds,"" Ms Svyrydenko said. Everything from railways stations to factories would need to be rebuilt, she said. Ukraine has estimated the amount of money needed to rebuild the country at around $600bn. Last week, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the EU was examining how the frozen assets of Russian oligarchs could be used to pay for the reconstruction of Ukraine after the war.

Captured soldier Sgt Vadim Shishimarin was convicted of killing Oleksandr Shelipov, 62, in the north-eastern village of Chupakhivka on 28 February. He admitted shooting Mr Shelipov but said he had been acting on orders and asked forgiveness of the man's widow. Many other alleged war crimes are being investigated by Ukraine. And in a conflict where the deliberate targeting of civilians has become one of the defining features, Monday's outcome sets a significant legal precedent. Moscow has always denied its troops have targeted civilians, despite a wealth of evidence to the contrary, while Ukraine says more than 11,000 crimes may have occurred. Ukraine, however, is likely to bring more cases like this to unpick Moscow's blanket denials. This sentencing is unlikely to lead to an immediate change in tactics from the invading forces, but it does bring Oleksandr Shelipov's widow Kateryna Shelipova justice. Imposing the life sentence, Judge Serhiy Agafonov said Shishimarin, 21, had carried out a ""criminal order"" by a soldier of higher rank. ""Given that the crime committed is a crime against peace, security, humanity and the international legal order... the court does not see the possibility of imposing a [shorter] sentence of imprisonment,"" he said. Shishimarin, wearing a blue and grey hooded sweatshirt, watched proceedings silently from a reinforced glass box in the courtroom and showed no emotion as the verdict was read out. His lawyer said an appeal would be lodged against the verdict. The Kremlin's response is already in motion, with laws being drafted and courts being set up in Russia to try some Ukrainian prisoners as war criminals. This suggests both countries could soon find themselves in a legal tit-for-tat while the conflict rages on. Shishimarin served in Russia's Kantemirovskaya tank division. At the time of the killing, he and other soldiers were travelling in a car they had seized after their convoy came under attack and they became separated from their unit. When they spotted Mr Shelipov he was speaking on his phone, Shishimarin told the court. He said he was told to shoot him with an assault rifle. His defence lawyer told the court on Friday that Shishimarin had only fired after twice refusing to carry out the order to shoot and that only one out of three to four rounds had hit the man. He said Shishimarin fired the rounds out of fear for his own safety and he questioned whether the defendant had intended to kill. In one dramatic moment, the victim's widow Kateryna Shelipova confronted Shishimarin. ""Tell me please, why did you [Russians] come here? To protect us?"" she asked, citing Russian President Vladimir Putin's justification for the invasion of Ukraine. ""Protect us from whom? Did you protect me from my husband, whom you killed?"" The soldier had no answer to that. Asking forgiveness of the widow earlier, he said: ""But I understand you won't be able to forgive me."" Ms Shelipova told the BBC: ""I feel very sorry for him but for a crime like that - I can't forgive him."" Since President Putin sent Russian troops into Ukraine on 24 February, at least 3,838 civilians have been killed and 4,351 injured, according to the UN. Among the dead are numerous suspected victims of war crimes in occupied towns such as Bucha. Earlier this month, the BBC obtained CCTV footage of the killing of two civilians in cold blood allegedly by Russian soldiers, a case now being investigated by prosecutors as a suspected war crime. BBC Panorama investigates alleged war crimes in Ukraine in Hunting Putin's War Criminals, which airs on Monday 23 May at 20:30 in the UK. You can watch the programme after it airs here. "

Ukraine says it has identified more than 10,000 possible war crimes, However, the Russian government denies it has been targeting civilians. The International Criminal Court has also sent a team of investigators and forensics experts to the country. It may not seem like it, but ""even war has rules"", as the International Committee of the Red Cross puts it. These are contained in treaties called the Geneva Conventions and a string of other international laws and agreements. Civilians cannot be deliberately attacked - nor can the infrastructure that is vital to their survival. Some weapons are banned because of the indiscriminate or appalling suffering they cause - such as anti-personnel landmines and chemical or biological weapons. The sick and wounded must be cared for - including injured soldiers, who have rights as prisoners of war. Serious offences such as murder, rape or mass persecution of a group are known as ""crimes against humanity"" or, in some circumstances, ""genocide"". The 21-year-old Russian tank commander Vadim Shishimarin admitted shooting 62-year-old Oleksandr Shelipov in the head, a few days after the invasion began. Sentencing Shishimarin, the judge said he had committed ""a crime against peace, security, humanity and the international legal order"" and that only a life sentence was appropriate. Ukraine is preparing cases against 41 Russian soldiers for offences including killing civilians, rape, bombing civilian infrastructure and looting. US President Joe Biden and UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson have both accused Russia of carrying out war crimes in Ukraine. Investigators and journalists found what appeared to be evidence of the deliberate killing of civilians in Bucha, a town on the outskirts of Kyiv, and other nearby areas. Ukrainian forces said they found mass graves and evidence that civilians had been killed after their feet and hands were bound. In March, a Russian strike on a theatre in Mariupol appeared to be the first confirmed location of a mass killing. The word ""children"" was written in giant letters outside the building. Ukraine previously called Russia's air strike on Mariupol's hospital a war crime. Many experts argue the invasion itself is a crime under the concept of ""aggressive warfare"". There have been a series of one-off courts since World War Two - including the tribunal investigating war crimes during the 1990s break-up of Yugoslavia. A body was also set up to prosecute those responsible for the 1994 Rwanda genocide. Today, the International Criminal Court (ICC) and the International Court of Justice (ICJ) both have roles upholding the rules of war. The International Court of Justice (ICJ) rules on disputes between states, but cannot prosecute individuals. Ukraine has begun a case against Russia. If the ICJ ruled against Russia, the UN Security Council (UNSC) would be responsible for enforcing that. But Russia - one of council's five permanent members - could veto any proposal to sanction it. The International Criminal Court (ICC) investigates and prosecutes individual war criminals who are not before the courts of individual states. It's the permanent modern successor to Nuremberg, which prosecuted key Nazi leaders in 1945. Nuremberg cemented the principle that nations could set up special courts to uphold international law. The ICC's chief prosecutor, British lawyer Karim Khan QC, believes there is a reasonable basis to believe war crimes have been carried out in Ukraine. Investigators will look at past and present allegations - going back as far as 2013, before Russia's annexation of Crimea from Ukraine. If there's evidence, the prosecutor will ask ICC judges to issue arrest warrants to bring individuals to trial in The Hague. However the court doesn't have its own police force so relies on individual states to arrest suspects - and since Russia is not a member of the court it is unlikely to extradite any suspects. It's far easier to pin a war crime on the soldier who commits it, than the leader who ordered it. Hugh Williamson of Human Rights Watch - an organisation with expertise in gathering evidence of war crimes in conflicts - agrees there is evidence of summary executions and other grave abuses by Russian forces. He says establishing the ""chain of command"" is very important for any future trials - including whether a leader authorised an atrocity - or turned a blind eye to it. The ICC can also prosecute the offence of ""waging aggressive war"". This is the crime of an unjustified invasion or conflict, beyond justifiable military action in self-defence. It originated at Nuremberg, after the judge sent by Moscow convinced the Allies that Nazi leaders should face justice for ""crimes against peace"". However, Professor Philippe Sands QC, an expert on international law at University College London, says the ICC couldn't prosecute Russia's leaders for this because the country isn't a signatory to the court. In theory, the UN Security Council could ask the ICC to investigate this offence. But again, Russia could veto this. Prof Sands wants world leaders to set up a one-off tribunal to prosecute the crime of aggression in Ukraine. "

Speaking in Japan, he appeared to contradict long-standing US policy in the region, although the White House insisted there had been no departure. Mr Biden drew a parallel between Taiwan and Russia's invasion of Ukraine, prompting an angry rebuke from Beijing. He is on his first tour of Asia as US president, visiting regional allies. Mr Biden prefaced his remarks saying US policy toward Taiwan ""has not changed"". But his comments in Tokyo are the second time in recent months he has unequivocally stated the US would defend Taiwan if China attacked, in what has been seen as a change in tone. The US has previously been vague on what it would do in such a situation. China regards Taiwan as a breakaway province that must be re-unified with the mainland. Beijing's foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin insisted: ""Taiwan is an inalienable part of China's territory... there's no room for compromise or concession. ""The Taiwan question and the Ukraine issue are fundamentally different. To compare those two is absurd. We once again urge the US to abide by the One China principle."" The US has no official diplomatic ties with Taiwan, but sells arms to it as part of its Taiwan Relations Act, which states that the US must provide the island with the means to defend itself. At the same time, it maintains formal ties with China and also diplomatically acknowledges China's position that there is only one Chinese government. Mr Biden was answering questions in Tokyo during a press conference with Japanese PM Fumio Kishida, when a journalist asked them about the defence of Taiwan. The US president began by directly linking the China-Taiwan situation to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. If there was a rapprochement eventually between Ukraine and Russia, and sanctions were not sustained, ""then what does this signal to China about the cost of attempting to take Taiwan by force?"" he asked. ""They are already flirting with danger right now by flying so close and all the manoeuvres that they are undertaking,"" Mr Biden said, referring to increasing reports of Chinese warplane incursions into Taiwan's self-declared air defence zone. He added that while ""my expectation is that it [a Chinese invasion] will not happen, it will not be attempted"", at the same time it depended on ""how strong the world makes clear that that kind of action is going to result in long term disapprobation"". He was then asked directly if the US would defend Taiwan militarily if China invaded, when it has not done so in the invasion of Ukraine, and he responded: ""Yes... that's the commitment we made. ""The idea that it [Taiwan] can be taken by force... is just not appropriate. It will dislocate the entire region and be another action similar to what happened in Ukraine."" It took the US State Department only minutes to start walking back Joe Biden's comments. This is not the first time he has said he would defend Taiwan. It could be an expression of his deep personal disquiet about the Ukraine invasion, and the prospect of something similar happening in Taiwan. In March, he did something very similar when he said ""Vladmir Putin cannot stay in power"", forcing US officials to swiftly deny America was calling for regime change in Moscow. But when asked about it later, Mr Biden did not back down. He was, he said, expressing his ""moral outrage"" at what Putin was doing. Today he seemed to be saying ""I won't let that happen to Taiwan"". The official position of the US government on Taiwan is ""strategic ambiguity"" - the US doesn't commit to defend Taiwan, but it doesn't say it wouldn't either. This is supposed to keep China guessing. But as China has got stronger, and its threats to Taiwan more real, there have been voices calling for an end to this fudge. Former Japanese PM Shinzo Abe recently said it was time for America to be clear to Beijing - and say it would defend Taiwan. Others think this is a really bad idea and could provoke Beijing in to accelerating its plans to retake the island. Privately, many senior officials in Washington and Tokyo are extremely worried about Taiwan, about Beijing's growing military advantage, and they are fumbling for a new strategy to deal with the threat. In the meantime, Mr Biden seems to be speaking his own truth. "

Severodonetsk, the largest city under Ukrainian control in Luhansk province, has come under intense artillery and missile fire from Moscow's forces. On Sunday, local officials said Russian troops were repelled after trying to enter the city from four directions. It comes as Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky urged world leaders to end all trade with Russia. Speaking via video link at the annual World Economic Forum in Davos, Mr Zelensky called for ""maximum sanctions"" to be imposed on Moscow, saying frozen Russian funds should be used to rebuild Ukrainian cities destroyed by the war. ""There has to be a precedent for punishing the aggressor,"" Mr Zelensky said. ""If the aggressor loses everything then it definitely deprives him of any motivation to start a war."" Meanwhile, Luhansk Governor Serhiy Gaidai accused Moscow of adopting a ""scorched-earth approach"" in its efforts to capture the city of Severodonetsk. ""Every day they are trying to break the line of defence,"" Mr Gaidai said. ""They are simply systematically destroying the city. Everywhere is being shelled constantly."" The city of 100,000 people sits on a strategic position on the Donets River, with UK defence officials saying it has likely become one of Russia's ""immediate tactical priorities"". Mr Gaidai warned that Russian forces have destroyed all but one bridge across the Donets river and said that the city is at risk of being cut off. He also accused Russian tanks of firing on residential buildings during fighting in the city and of seeking to erase Severodonetsk ""from the face of the earth"". Ukraine's human right's ombudsman, Lyudmyla Denisova, said the city risks suffering the same fate as Mariupol - being surrounded and pounded into submission. ""The enemy threw all his forces to storm Severodonetsk, on the outskirts of which there are constant battles,"" Ms Denisova wrote on Telegram. by Jeremy Bowen in Donbas We visited the Ukrainian front line yesterday and the main thrust of the Russian activities at the moment is at Severodonetsk. Kyiv's soldiers have told us it is largely surrounded and they are undoubtedly under pressure. They've taken serious casualties and a Ukrainian military source said one unit that went into combat with 240 men returned with just 135 - the others killed, wounded or taken prisoner. The Russians have taken some territory - villages and little towns - but it's a very heavily defended area. They've been fighting around there since 2014 and there are concrete Ukrainian positions that are hard to overcome. A couple of days ago in Moscow, the ministry of defence said they would take the whole of the Luhansk region. If Vladimir Putin can seize the whole of Luhansk and then do something similar in Donetsk, he could then say to Russians: ""This is a victory guys."" It would be nothing like the victory he sought when all this started in February, but one he could declare anyway. The Ukrainian authorities are very anxious that doesn't happen. Elsewhere, at least seven civilians were killed and eight others were wounded in Sunday's bombardment of the Donetsk region, according to the Ukrainian army's Facebook page. Shelling and missile strikes have targeted Kharkiv in the north, as well as Mykolaiv and Zaporizhzhia in the south, officials said. The UK's Ministry of Defence has said that Russia has likely suffered a similar number of casualties in Ukraine as it did during the entirety of the Soviet war in Afghanistan. It said ""a combination of poor low-level tactics, limited air cover, a lack of flexibility, and a command approach which is prepared to reinforce failure and repeat mistakes officials"" had contributed to the high figures. It is unclear exactly how many casualties Russia has suffered in its invasion. Moscow, which says it launched a ""special operation"" to demilitarise its neighbour, has not updated its official figures since March, when defence officials said some 1,351 troops had been killed. Meanwhile, the United Nations has said the global number of forcibly displaced people has risen above 100 million for the first time. Officials said Russia's invasion of Ukraine has contributed to the grim milestone. More than 14 million people are thought to have fled their homes since the war began on 24 February. The UN's High Commissioner for Refugees, Filippo Grandi, said the announcement should serve as a wake up call for world leaders. ""The international response to people fleeing war in Ukraine has been overwhelmingly positive,"" Mr Grandi said. ""But ultimately humanitarian aid is a palliative, not a cure. ""To reverse this trend the only answer is peace and stability so that innocent people are not forced to gamble between acute danger at home or precarious flight or exile."" "

West Northamptonshire Council said more than 250 sponsors had come forward but it needed ""additional help"". The authority said a £350-a-month ""thank you payment"" was available for sponsors who were ""successfully matched to Ukrainian guests"". Conservative councillor David Smith said welcoming people into your home could be ""exceedingly rewarding"". He said the authority was making the plea as ""there might well be people who were not in a position to offer accommodation who might now be able to help"". The council said it also wanted to hear from anyone whose initial sponsorship request did not work out. Mr Smith, cabinet member for community safety and engagement and regulatory services, said: ""We'd like to hear from any who would still like to do their bit. ""We're extremely grateful for all of the help so far from the more than 250 sponsors who have come forward, yet we could do with some additional help. ""This is certainly not something to go into lightly; welcoming people you don't know into your home can be challenging, though it can also be exceedingly rewarding."" Hosts are offered a tax-free payment of £350-a-month for up to 12 months, regardless of how many individuals they support. The government website said hosts were not expected to cover their guests' living expenses, although they could if they wish. Those who are granted visas can live and work in the UK for up to three years, and access healthcare, welfare and schools. Find BBC News: East of England on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

Under Welsh rules, many animals brought over have to be in quarantine centres for up to four months. Elsewhere in the UK they can quarantine in homes after health checks. The Welsh government said it wants to reduce the risk of rabies and has ""concerns about how the current home isolation process can be monitored and enforced effectively"". Marianna Koniushenko, 18, who fled to Cardiff with her family, said her two dogs would help the trauma and anxiety she suffers after escaping Bucha in Ukraine. Along with brother Roman, 14, and mother Larysa Martseva, she managed to escape, despite people in cars in front and behind them being killed by Russian troops. But they had to leave their Rhodesian Ridgebacks Trisha and Vinchi in Dover when they arrived the UK on 26 April. They are now in kennels in Poulton-le-Fylde, south of Blackpool and they do not know when they will be reunited. Ms Koniushenko said she is suffering from trauma following their experiences, adding: ""I think the dogs could help me. I can hug them and tell them all about my problems. ""I feel really upset. It's like a part of me. The dogs are a part of our family."" Her mum said: ""My children have lost a huge part of their emotional support. Their lives - their happy lives in their country - changed just like that. ""They had a nice life and it's very important for all of us to be all together."" The family has been sent photos of the dogs by staff at the kennels, but Ms Martseva added: ""I was crying when I saw the photos because it's like giving children to an orphanage. ""We love Wales and our host family but half of our family isn't here."" The family pleaded ""please let the dogs be with us"", with Ms Martseva saying: ""They are a five hour drive away. At least it would be great if the kennels were in Wales we're ready to drive to see them every day but we can't."" In Montgomery, Powys, on the border with England, three generations of the Komrokova family now live with a host family. Their three cats Senia, Charly and Flora are in a cattery, and they are trying to secure a temporary home for them nearby, in England, so they can visit them. Rita, eight, who has additional learning needs, finds comfort from spending time with the cats. Mark Michaels, who is hosting the family, said: ""We're a stone's throw from England here. You look out of the window and England is there it just seems desperately unfair. They would have chosen to be in England if they'd known they couldn't be with their animals."" Vladyslav Sdarikov, 24, who lives in Conwy, said he and his girlfriend, Darya Holodiak would have thought of different options if they had known their one-year-old pug Taylor had to quarantine in a kennel. Mr Sdarikov said: ""We cannot have him because of this invisible border for animals."" Rural Affairs Minister Lesley Griffiths said she worked closely with the chief veterinary officer when considering the rules. ""We haven't had rabies in this country for 100 years,"" she said. ""This is about protecting the animal that arrives from Ukraine. It's about protecting animals here in Wales and of course it's about public health as well. ""England and Scotland have chosen home confinement as a form of quarantine - how do you enforce that? How do you ensure that it absolutely takes place? It's impossible in my view."" A Welsh government spokesman said: ""We understand how important people's pets are to them and we want to do everything we can to ensure people seeking refuge in Wales are reunited with their pets safely and as quickly as possible. ""We also need to take steps to protect the health and welfare of all animals in Wales by reducing the risk of exposing them to diseases such as rabies. ""We have concerns about how the current home isolation process can be monitored and enforced effectively."" He said this is why the decision was taken, adding: ""We fully recognise the distress this can cause pet owners, particularly those who have come to Wales after fleeing the atrocities in Ukraine. ""We will continue to assess different options to keep the time their pets are in quarantine to a minimum."" The spokesman added there are quarantine places in Wales currently in use and efforts are being made to create more spaces. The UK government's Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said it had increased resources and streamlined processes to make sure those fleeing Ukraine with pets are not delayed. ""We have introduced a new rapid rabies blood test to cut quarantine times, and lower risk animals are being moved into isolation,"" he added. ""We are continuing to review processes and increase quarantine capacity - whilst maintaining our biosecurity standards."" "

Bristol City Council has asked Aid Box Community to prepare essentials for school-aged children arriving under the government's refugee scheme. The charity has also launched a crowdfunding campaign because of the ""huge demand"" for its services from refugees from Afghanistan and Ukraine. Free shop manager Clare Chislett said: ""We've had crisis after crisis"". ""We had hundreds of Afghan families arriving, now we've got the Ukrainian families arriving and we just have a huge increase in our demand,"" she added. Aid Box Community is asking for packs containing school uniforms and other school essentials. Ms Chislett said - ideally - the items should be in a rucksack that is ""age appropriate for that child"". She added: ""A little welcome note, some stationery if you feel like putting it in would be absolutely lovely"". They will not collect uniform with school logos on. The charity, which also provides a befriending scheme and activity groups, has already extended its free shop opening hours to five days a week. ""We've had 300 people arriving (locally) under the government scheme and many more Ukrainian refugees arriving via their own means,"" said Ms Chislett. ""So there's been a huge demand on our services and one of the things is we are seeing a lot of children. ""We just need to keep our services going and expand them."" Ms Chislett said, apart from uniforms for children, the charity desperately needed trainers for all ages. ""Our shelves are bare,"" she added. People can drop clearly-labelled rucksacks containing uniforms, along with any other donations, to Aid Box Community, on Cheltenham Road, Bristol, between 11:00 and 15:00 BST on weekdays.

190,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-61542365,2022-05-23T05:00:49,Ukraine war: The defiant Russians speaking out about the war," To Ukrainians it was clear from the very start of Russia's invasion that this was no ""special operation"" to liberate the Donbas region, as Vladimir Putin had declared. It was all-out war. But in Russia it's a crime to call it that. Dozens of people have already been prosecuted under the ""fake news"" law, as it's known. They face up to 15 years behind bars for challenging the official line on Russia's invasion or criticising the military. It's a dramatic increase in censorship in Russia, where Vladimir Putin has spent his two decades in power removing opponents, stifling free speech and silencing the independent media: a dismantling of democracy that is having devastating consequences here in Ukraine. Vladimir Kara-Murza tried to warn of the danger. In a speech in the US in March, the Russian opposition activist lambasted Western leaders for seeking constant ""resets"" in relations with Mr Putin, allowing their countries to act as havens for tainted money and looking the other way even as Russia became ever less free. ""The whole world now sees what the Putin regime is doing to Ukraine,"" Mr Kara-Murza told the Arizona House of Representatives, a fortnight into the war. ""The bombing of maternity wards and hospitals and schools. The war crimes. These are war crimes."" But in Russia uttering such words is also a crime now. A month after his speech, Mr Kara-Murza was picked up by police in Moscow and later charged with ""spreading false information"" about Russia's military. He's still in custody. The law he is accused of breaking was passed in March, soon after the invasion. And yet Ukrainian prosecutors have already registered more than 11,000 alleged war crimes. A Russian soldier has admitted in court to shooting a civilian. And the BBC has gathered its own evidence, including CCTV footage of the shooting of two civilians by Russian forces. Those returning to salvage what they can from the wreckage of Andriivka have more, powerful testimony. When Russia invaded Ukraine, many families fled Kyiv for nearby villages like this, thinking they would be safer away from the capital. Instead they spent weeks cowering in cold cellars as occupying soldiers drove tanks into their yards and dug trenches in their vegetable plots. After the Russians withdrew, in April, the village elder says the bodies of 13 residents were found here. ""They had their hands tied behind their backs and had been shot in the head,"" says Anatoliy Kibukevych. He then names every one of the victims. The main road - the route taken by Russian tanks ordered to seize Kyiv - is lined with the rubble of homes: heaps of singed bricks with metal bedframes or pots and pans oddly marooned in the middle of them. Painted pleas that read ""Children!"" or ""People!"" on garden gates have been pierced by shrapnel. ""Truth is the regime's main enemy,"" says Evgenia Kara-Murza, Vladimir's wife, from Washington DC, where she lives for safety reasons. ""That's why I believe this regime is using this law to crush all dissent in Russia and to scare people into silence,"" ""I'm sure Vladimir realised the risks were high. They have never been low for him,"" she says, with a reminder that her activist husband was poisoned twice in the past and nearly died. But he kept returning to Russia and speaking out. ""He believes there comes a moment where you can't be afraid anymore and need to show to other people that they shouldn't be either."" When the war in Ukraine started, Lilia Yapparova felt compelled to cover it. ""I couldn't sleep, because people started to die… and I needed to be there,"" she told me in Kyiv, where for a while she was the only Russian reporter on the ground in Ukrainian-controlled areas. There are only three even now - all women from independent media outlets. It's a tiny contingent compared with the Russian state TV correspondents who stride through eastern Ukraine in military clothing, ""Z"" patches on their arms in support of Russian soldiers, talking about ""denazification"" and the ""liberation"" of cities like Mariupol. Ms Yapparova wanted to at least dent that solid wall of propaganda. ""The only thing that matters for me right now is for the war to stop and for people from Russia to see what's really going on,"" she says. But that's a battle of its own, on top of the danger of working on Ukraine's frontlines. Meduza, the news site Ms Yapparova writes for, has been banned in Russia, like almost all independent outlets. Journalists and media have been labelled as ""foreign agents"" while Facebook and other social media are blocked. Meanwhile, state TV channels have all switched to wall-to-wall coverage of Russia's ""special operation"". ""For now we lost the war with propaganda,"" Ms Yapparova concedes, describing how even people she knows personally are absorbing the official line. She feels a sense of responsibility for that, although the odds were stacked impossibly against her. And now she knows that every word she writes from Ukraine - true stories about the shooting of civilians, mass graves, terrible destruction - is putting her at risk of prosecution for ""fake news"". ""I am ready for that. I am not covering my eyes. I see the law for what it is,"" the journalist says. ""But I couldn't allow myself not to be here."" It doesn't stop her worrying, though. ""Constantly. It hurts sometimes to write because I can't hide facts, but am I going to jail for that? Anything can happen."" For Michael Nacke the danger is already real. The young journalist left Russia before the war, escaping an environment that became increasingly repressive. He is now a wanted man for telling the truth. ""I used the word 'war' instead of 'special operation',"" he says of his ""crime"" as set-out by Russian investigators in a 91-page statement. ""It doesn't matter which law they use against you, it's just to make you shut up."" The prosecution is based on an episode on his YouTube channel in which he discusses how Russian tanks fired on a nuclear power plant in Zaporizhzhia. The incident was widely condemned, including at an emergency session of the UN Security Council. But Moscow claims Ukrainian forces set the fire themselves so in Russia that makes reporting anything else illegal. ""The one thing that I understand after this is that the work I do really matters,"" Mr Nacke says of the criminal case against him. ""I used to ask myself: 'Is my work effective to stop the war?' Now I see that it makes sense."" The risks and consequences of this war are far more severe for Ukrainians, as every shattered inch of Andriivka shows. ""We've been through so much. Fear and horror,"" Alina Petrovna tells me, as her son nails tarpaulin over the holes left in their roof by the shockwaves of heavy shelling. The elderly lady lived in the family vegetable cellar for 29 days after Russian troops took over her village. She was terrified. There are bullet holes in the front door where soldiers shot their way through to loot from them. The only thing they left untouched were her icons. ""Let the Russian people come and see what they did to us!"" Her eyes fill with angry tears. ""Fear and horror,"" she repeats. But most in Russia will never even hear about such suffering. Because Vladimir Putin has not only launched a war on Russia's neighbour, he has declared a war on truth.

Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus was speaking in Geneva, where the UN health agency's experts were discussing the monkeypox outbreak in 15 nations outside Africa. More than 80 cases have been confirmed in Europe, the US, Canada, Australia and Israel. However, the risk to the wider public is said to be low. Monkeypox - the virus that is most common in remote parts of Central and West Africa - does not tend to spread easily between people and the illness is usually mild. Most people who catch the virus recover within a few weeks, according to the UK's National Health Service. The outbreak has taken scientists by surprise, and UK health officials have issued new advice, saying high-risk contacts of cases should self-isolate for three weeks. Belgium became the first country to announce a three-week quarantine for infected persons on Friday. More confirmed cases are expected to be announced in the UK on Monday, the Guardian newspaper reports. Speaking at Sunday's opening of his agency's World Health Assembly, Dr Tedros said: ""Of course the [Covid] pandemic is not the only crisis in our world. ""As we speak our colleagues around the world are responding to outbreaks of Ebola in the Democratic Republic of Congo, monkeypox and hepatitis of unknown cause and complex humanitarian crises in Afghanistan, Ethiopia, Somalia, South Sudan, the Syrian Arab Republic, Ukraine and Yemen. ""We face a formidable convergence of disease, drought, famine and war, fuelled by climate change, inequity and geopolitical rivalry,"" the WHO head added. The WHO earlier said that a number of other suspected monkeypox cases were being investigated - without naming the countries involved - and warned that more infections were likely to be confirmed. After the outbreak was first identified in the UK, the virus began to be detected across Europe - with public health agencies in Spain, Portugal, Germany, Belgium, France, the Netherlands, Italy and Sweden all confirming cases. Further cases were confirmed in Austria and Switzerland on Sunday. The UK Health Security Agency has identified 20 cases so far and its chief medical adviser Dr Susan Hopkins told the BBC's Sunday Morning programme: ""We are detecting more cases on a daily basis."" She said the virus was now spreading in the community - with cases detected which have had no contact with anyone who has visited West Africa, where the disease is endemic. But the risk to the general population remains ""extremely low"", with cases so far mostly found in some urban areas and among gay or bisexual men, Dr Hopkins said. Although there is no specific vaccine for monkeypox, several countries have said they are stocking smallpox vaccines, which are about 85% effective in preventing infection because the two viruses are quite similar. It is not yet clear why this unexpected outbreak is happening now. One possibility is that the virus has changed in some way, although currently there is little evidence to suggest this is a new variant. Another explanation is that the virus has found itself in the right place at the right time to thrive. Monkeypox may also spread more easily than it did in the past, when the smallpox vaccine was widely used. "

The apparent hardening of Ukraine's position comes a day after President Volodymyr Zelensky said the war could be resolved only through diplomacy. Presidential adviser Mykhaylo Podolyak said concessions would lead to an even larger and bloodier Russian offensive. His comments come as Russia continues attempts to encircle Ukrainian forces defending Severodonetsk in the east. In another development, Polish President Andrzej Duda has become the first foreign leader to address the parliament in Kyiv in person. He received a standing ovation as he declared that only Ukrainians themselves could decide their future. He added that Poland would do everything it could to help Ukraine join the EU. However, France's Europe Minister, Clément Beaune, said in a radio interview on Sunday that it would probably take ""15 or 20 years"" for Ukraine to be accepted as an EU member. As fighting continued, the General Staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces said in its daily update that Russian forces were trying to break through Ukrainian defences to reach the administrative borders of the country's easternmost Luhansk region. Luhansk regional governor, Serhiy Haidai, said Russia had attempted to break into Severodonetsk from four separate directions. Writing on the Telegram messaging app, he said the attempts had been unsuccessful, but shelling of residential areas was continuing. He added that a bridge connecting the city to nearby Lysychansk had been destroyed. It was not possible for the BBC to verify the claims independently. There have been calls in some Western nations for a ceasefire that could involve Russian forces remaining in some of the territory they have occupied in the south and east of Ukraine since Moscow invaded the country on 24 February. Most recently, Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi told his country's Senate on Thursday that a ceasefire ""must be achieved as soon as possible"". But Mr Podolyak said that any such moves would backfire. ""The war will not stop. It will just be put on pause for some time,"" he said. ""They'll start a new offensive, even more bloody and large-scale."" The BBC's Joe Inwood in Kyiv says there is currently no middle ground between what the Russians want and what the Ukrainians would accept.

Then imagine doing that in a war zone. ""It's scary, but what can you do? We don't have many other options,"" said Ukrainian nurse Ira Yusko, 30, smiling grimly, as she switched on her headlamp at the Toretsk coal mine in the eastern Donbas region. Around her, more than a dozen miners - their faces already smeared with grime - shuffled forwards in the dark towards a rattling iron elevator that stood waiting to take the group 800 metres underground for a six-hour shift. ""We try to be positive. But it's hard on the soul. Depressing. These are terrible times. It's sad at home too - my wife is gone,"" said Vitaly Vahorder. He's spent half his life working at the Toretsk mine. His family recently joined the exodus heading west to safer locations. Outside, the occasional boom and crunch of artillery fire echoed across the wheat fields from the front lines 4km to the east and south, where Russian troops are struggling to gain ground against fierce Ukrainian resistance in Donbas. ""People go down the mine knowing they may not come back up. And when you do come back up, anything can happen - the town is constantly being bombed,"" said Anatoly Sholokhov, deputy head of Toretsk's coal miners' association, as he watched the elevator door slide shut. The 69-year-old miner was born in the town and was once its mayor. The coal mines, their steep-sided slag heaps dotting the horizon like dark pyramids, have been a defining feature of eastern Ukraine for well over a century. They provided the Russian Empire, and then the Soviet Union, with much of its raw energy. But the collapse of the USSR in 1991, the past eight years of separatist conflict with pro-Russian militias, and the Kremlin's new offensive have combined to force most of the mines to close. One of many concerns today is that the latest mine closures are happening abruptly, and without proper safety measures, causing old shafts to flood with highly toxic water that threatens to poison local rivers. ""The danger comes when you stop several mines at once,"" said Anatoly. ""You can't control where the ground water goes. It would be a disaster if it comes to the surface. This whole area would become uninhabitable. So, an ecological crisis looms over our town. May God prevent these mines from stopping. If the work stops and water begins to flood the mines, it could cause a catastrophe,"" Only two mines are still working here in Toretsk - formerly called Dzerzhynsk in honour of the founder of the Communist secret police. Driving in from the west, past Ukrainian army checkpoints and roadblocks and into the near-empty town with its Soviet-era architecture and monuments, is like stepping back into the past. A Soviet red star still clings to the top of one of the oldest towers at the Toretsk mine, which first began producing coal in the 1930s, and was badly damaged during World War Two. The mine appears to have experienced few improvements, or even licks of paint, since it was refurbished in 1955. One sunny morning last week, staff showed visitors around the site. Giant pieces of rusting machinery sat beside doodle-like swirls of rail track, where a lone female worker was busy pushing mine carts into a wooden shed by hand. Two giant slag heaps behind the mine were partially covered with trees and undergrowth. A huge tree grew through one ancient winding wheel. Overhead, floorboards creaked ominously as staff walked along a footbridge from the shaft back to the communal shower block - currently without water, like the rest of the town, due to blockages on a nearby canal which locals blamed on the war. ""There's no water anywhere in this town. You go to the toilet - but how do you flush? When it rains, everyone in our apartment block goes out to collect rainwater,"" said Vitaly. Only a third of the mine's staff have stayed on in the town since the Russian offensive began earlier this year - some out of loyalty to the mine itself, but mostly for financial reasons. ""I've been working here for twenty years. I went straight to the mines after school. We don't have any other professions here. No factories. We earn 8,000 to 10,000 hryvnias a month (£220 - £275, $275 - $343) and with the current prices that's nothing, tiny, no better than a student's stipend,"" said Yuri Podlutsky. As a group, the miners appeared reluctant to pass judgement on the war or President Putin directly. Many of them are Russian-speaking and appeared keen to avoid territory that could cause frictions within a tight-knit community. But several men acknowledged a strong nostalgia for the Soviet era and the times when Ukrainians and Russians worked side by side in the mines. ""Whether you want Putin or not, we still need to live and work. There are a lot of 'Soviets' here,"" said Vitaly. ""I consider myself simply a local. Some of us speak Russian as our first language. But we all share the same sky."" "
194,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-61523624,2022-05-22T00:27:05,"Governments should subsidise food and energy, says IMF boss"," Governments need to subsidise the cost of food and energy for the poorest members of society, the head of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has told the BBC. People around the world are struggling with the rising cost of living. Kristalina Georgieva said support needs to be provided ""in a very targeted manner, preferably by providing subsidies directly to people"". Many governments are providing some help but critics argue it's not enough. When it comes to the cost of living crisis, Ms Georgieva said: ""There are two priorities, one the very poor people, segments of society that are now struggling with high food and energy prices"". The second, she added, is to support those businesses that have been ""most damaged"" by the war in Ukraine. The IMF's role is to work with governments to stabilise the global economy and enhance prosperity. However, that's proving challenging because food prices have hit record highs this year, whilst oil and gas prices have also risen sharply. This is largely because of the twin shocks of the coronavirus pandemic and the war in Ukraine. Between them Russia and Ukraine are major exporters of crops and hydrocarbons. The importance of these commodities to the global economy has led the annualised inflation rate to reach its highest point in decades in many countries: 9% in the UK, 8.3% in the US and 7.4% in the Eurozone. Central banks are lifting interest rates to try and slow the increase in prices, which has led some influential figures such as Goldman Sachs' Lloyd Blankfein to warn of the risk of recession. Ms Georgieva is concerned about the impact those higher borrowing costs will have on governments who have to repay huge debts they took on to get through the pandemic. She said governments needed to be ""very careful"" about how much money they spent and what they spent it on. The problems of falling living standards was at the top of the agenda at this week's meeting of G7 finance ministers in Germany. The meeting of seven wealthy countries ended with a pledge to ""continue to work together to minimise the impact of the war globally as well as on our own economies and population by providing well-targeted support, where necessary"". Over the last few months governments have made a range of interventions to try and lower the cost of living. In the US President Biden has released oil from reserves to try and bring prices down, Spain and Portugal have capped gas bills and it's a leading issue in Australia's election. In the UK Chancellor Rishi Sunak has made some tax changes and is considering a windfall tax on the soaring profits of energy companies. Ms Georgieva is concerned that without the correct government support the protests seen in Sri Lanka could be repeated in other countries. Sri Lanka's economic crisis, exacerbated by rising prices, has led to deadly riots, a new prime minister and a first ever default on its debts. The IMF boss said such similar unrest before the pandemic, from France to Chile, was caused by ""a sense of inequality growing"" and decisions being made without the support of the people. ""If we are to learn any lessons from 2019 if is to be much more humble about policy decisions, and engage in multiple ways with people, because policies must be for people, not the paper we write them on,"" she said. A group of international development bodies including the IMF and World Bank this week launched a major plan to try and tackle food insecurity around the world. It was spearheaded by US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, who said it was necessary because: ""There's a very real risk that soaring global market prices of food and fertiliser will result in more people going hungry."" Ms Georgieva said that while there is plenty of food, it is not evenly distributed. The solutions, she said, are growing more crops where possible but also a greater focus on agricultural productivity, ""not only because of the war, but because of climate change"". She added: ""Trade needs to be retained open, we should not have a situation in which countries hold on to food more than they need and create all kinds of barriers for moving it from one place to another."" India is the world's second biggest wheat producer but has banned exports, just as other countries were looking for it to make up some of the shortfall from Ukraine's inability to ship its produce. Narendra Modi's government says that ban could be revised at some point. ""I would really beg them to reconsider, that is such a difficult moment for the world,"" Ms Georgieva said. ""I understand they need to feed their people. They have 1.4 billion of them, but let's all act in a collaborative manner because only if you do [that, do] we have a chance to overcome this crisis.""

Speaking on Ukrainian television, he suggested his country could be victorious on the battlefield - but that the war could only come to a conclusive halt ""at the negotiating table"". But he indicated this would not be easy, as neither side wanted to give anything up - and negotiations between the two sides have stalled. Meanwhile, on the ground, Russia's military said Mariupol's Azovstal steelworks had been ""completely liberated"", with the last Ukrainian defenders surrendering. However, the exact number of fighters who are now in Russian hands is still not clear. Russia claims more than 2,000 have surrendered, a number that hasn't been confirmed by Ukraine. But the end of fighting in Mariupol has freed up Russian troops for redeployment elsewhere - with fierce fighting reported around the city of Severodonetsk as Russia steps up its attempt to capture the whole eastern region of Luhansk. Ukraine's First Lady Olena Zelenska has given a rare interview with her husband. This is only the second time the couple have been seen together since the beginning of the war in Ukraine. She said that even though she hadn't seen her husband for two and a half months, not even the war could take him away from her. Kherson was the first city in Ukraine to be occupied by Russia. But in the past few weeks, more people have been seeking to leave the city as Russia tightens its grip on occupied territory. Escapees tell stories of intimidation by Russian police, soaring food prices and fear of kidnap by the authorities. Despite the risks, they say, many still want to make the journey out. The BBC spoke to Alexander, one of a number of volunteer drivers crossing the front line to evacuate civilians from Kherson and other Russian-controlled areas in eastern Ukraine. Quietly spoken, in his early twenties, he used to work in advocacy before the war. ""We can go along one road on the way in, but by the time we go back there's a crater from an explosion,"" he says. ""Then we know that the enemy shells have arrived. Then we pray, you can shell a little to the left, a little to the right. Just leave us a corridor in the middle so we can get people out.""

Speaking on national TV, he suggested his country could be victorious against Russia on the battlefield. However, he added that the war could only come to a conclusive halt ""at the negotiating table"". Meanwhile, heavy fighting is taking place in and around Severodonetsk, as Russian forces step up efforts to seize the whole of the Luhansk region. The end of fighting in the southern port city of Mariupol has freed up Russian troops for redeployment elsewhere and allowed them to intensify their onslaught in the east. Local governor Serhiy Haidai said the Russians were ""destroying"" Severodonetsk as they gradually surrounded it. Writing on the messaging app Telegram, he said Ukrainian troops had repelled 11 attacks on the frontline - with eight tanks among the Russian vehicles destroyed. There was no independent confirmation of the claims. BBC correspondent James Waterhouse said Russia had increased its artillery and air strikes as well as missile attacks - gaining ground mile by mile in Luhansk while the Ukrainians are forced to retreat. In his TV address, Mr Zelensky said the conflict ""will be bloody, there will be fighting, but it will only definitively end through diplomacy"". But he indicated this would not be easy, as neither side wanted to give anything up. On Tuesday, Kyiv's lead negotiator, Mykhaylo Podolyak, said talks were on hold. The following day, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov accused Kyiv authorities of not wanting to continue talks to end hostilities. Russian news agencies say the last meeting happened nearly a month ago, on 22 April. With no end in sight to the fighting, the US is sending more military, economic and humanitarian aid. On Saturday, President Joe Biden signed a bill to provide a package for Ukraine worth nearly $40bn (£32bn), the White House said. The money represents the largest programme of American assistance since Russia launched its invasion in February. The bill, which will funnel support to Ukraine for about the next five months, includes some $6bn budgeted for armoured vehicles and air defences. President Zelensky tweeted his gratitude, saying military aid was ""needed more than ever"". It also emerged on Saturday that President Biden is one of over 900 US citizens who have been indefinitely banned from entering Russia. The list also includes Secretary of State Antony Blinken, CIA chief William Burns and hundreds of members of Congress. In another development, Russia has switched off its gas supply to Finland after it refused Moscow's demand to pay for fuel in Russian roubles. "

Lilia Onopa, 43, and her children received an official welcome in Chepstow, Monmouthshire, on Friday. She tearfully described seeing her hometown destroyed, people killed, and wanting to save her sons. Having fled their home north of Dnipro, where military strikes began in early March, Ms Onopa and her boys travelled to Bucharest, Romania. This was after attacks on the port city of Odesa made other methods of travel impossible. They arrived in the Monmouthshire town last week after waiting five weeks for the British Embassy to approve their online application. At the gathering, they were given the keys to a bungalow, a former caretaker's property which has been refurbished by volunteers from St Mary's RC Primary School and church with donations from across the area. Speaking of the horrors she and her children had encountered after the war began, Ms Onopa thanked everyone who had helped them get to a place of safety, including the UK government who she said came to her aid when there were issues with their applications. Ms Onopa said: ""The horrible situation happening to our country is because one person, one regime decided my country should not exist, that my nation should not exist. ""Imagine living next to a neighbour, he might have completely different opinions but you do live together. ""And one day your neighbour decides to invade your house, destroy your house, kill your kids, just because they think you're going to invade them."" She said every mother would probably be able to understand how she was not scared for her own life, but those of her children. ""We saw our cities being destroyed, rockets falling on our houses and people dying, and the worst thing was we could do nothing to stop it,"" she added. ""All we could think about is what are we going to do next."" Ms Onopa said she posted an appeal for help on social media and a group in the UK said they would help her. She said travelling to the border she had seen thousands of displaced families, desperate for a route out of the war-torn areas. ""I was terrified I would lose my children so I wrote the addresses and contact details of my family in their rucksacks and clothes in the hope that should I die someone would know where to take them to safety,"" she said. Since arriving in the UK, Ms Onopa said she has felt ""overwhelmed"" with support. ""I don't have enough words to describe how grateful I am to everyone who helped,"" she said. ""I'm overwhelmed with the feeling that my kids can finally feel safe."" Ms Onopa said she was keen to learn English and has already enrolled in classes. Having been a keen cook and baker in Ukraine, she said she would like to start her own pastry business, and wants to volunteer to help other Ukrainian refugees settle. She said her sons, aged between five and 15, were looking forward to beginning school. But the devastation continuing in her own country where many of her family members and friends are still remains a source of fear and turmoil, she said. ""As a nation we haven't stopped fighting but its very difficult,"" she said. ""Just a couple of days ago I saw a 23-year-old boy from my village had been buried after being killed by the invaders."" Presenting Ms Onopa with the keys, Archbishop of Cardiff George Stack said: ""This is an opportunity to say to our new family croesi i Gymru, welcome to Wales. The land of sanctuary. ""And we hope and pray that you will be happy and fulfilled and content as you begin to understand what wonderful people live and work in Wales."" Chair of governors, Phil Cotterell said: ""Lilia and her family will not be alone, there is an incredible network of support here in Chepstow."" "

Ms Truss told the Telegraph that talks were under way with allies about how to help smaller nations defend themselves. She said it was clear that, despite limited success in Ukraine, President Vladimir Putin retained ""ambitions to create a greater Russia"". Moldova, once a Soviet republic, sits on Ukraine's south-western border. It does not share a border with Russia, but is close to some of the regions currently occupied by Russian forces in Ukraine's south. Moldova is not a member of Nato, although it did apply to join the European Union less than two weeks after the invasion of Ukraine. Ms Truss said that discussions about upgrading Ukrainian defences to deter future aggression would also cover ""other vulnerable states such as Moldova"". ""I would want to see Moldova equipped to Nato standard,"" she said. ""This is a discussion we're having with our allies."" Asked whether that was because Russia was thought to pose a security threat to Moldova, she said: ""Absolutely. I mean, Putin has been clear about his ambitions to create a greater Russia. ""And just because his attempts to take Kyiv weren't successful, doesn't mean he's abandoned those ambitions."" Moldova, one of Europe's poorest countries, is home to many ethnic Ukrainians and has taken in more than 437,000 refugees from the war. In a country of 2.6 million people that is higher than any other for the size of its population. Moldova's President Maia Sandu is strongly pro-EU, but her predecessor Igor Dodon - who still has many supporters - was pro-Russian. Russia supports separatists who control a breakaway region called Transnistria and has around 1,500 troops there. In late April, the Transnistrian authorities said that explosions had targeted their state security HQ in the main city of Tiraspol, Soviet-era radio masts used to broadcast Russian news, and a military unit in a village outsider Tiraspol. Separatist authorities blamed Ukrainian ""infiltrators"" but Kyiv said Russian special services were responsible. Dr Jack Watling, senior research fellow at defence and security think tank the Royal United Services Institute, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""There isn't an immediate threat against Moldova from the Russian military but there is definitely a significant threat from Russian subversive activity and destabilisation actions."" He said it was ""sensible"" to build up ""appropriate capabilities"" so Moldova ""can stand on its own two feet"" given that Russia has publicly indicated that it has designs on that country. ""It is worth doing that while you have the time to do it properly rather than coming to the problem when the threat is very acute"", he added. Ms Truss' comments come just weeks after she said the West ""must be prepared for the long haul and double down on our support"" for Ukraine. Speaking in London, she said: ""If Putin succeeds there will be untold further misery across Europe and terrible consequences across the globe. We would never feel safe again."" She also called for an increase in the UK's defence spending and said that the Nato target of 2% of GDP should be a ""floor, not a ceiling"". In April, Prime Minister Boris Johnson promised that the UK would provide Ukraine with more military equipment. In a phone conversation with President Volodymyr Zelensky, he pledged that more armoured vehicles, drones and anti-tank weapons would be sent. On Friday, the PM also held a call with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan in which they discussed recent applications for Nato membership by Sweden and Finland. Turkey has signalled an intention to veto the applications, accusing the countries of not taking a ""clear stance"" against Kurdish groups it considers to be terrorists. A Downing Street spokesperson said Mr Johnson had told Mr Erdoğan that Finland and Sweden would be valuable additions to the Nato alliance, and had encouraged him to work with counterparts in both countries to address any concerns ahead of a summit of the military alliance in Madrid in June.

Russia's gas giant Gazprom confirmed it had completely halted exports to Finland at 04:00 GMT on Saturday. Finland said all the deliveries had stopped, but added there would be no disruption to customers. Helsinki has been refusing to pay for its supplies in roubles. But the cut-off also follows an announcement that Finland will apply for Nato membership. Despite its invasion of Ukraine on 24 February, Russia continues to supply gas to many European countries. After Western powers sanctioned Russia over the war, Russia said ""unfriendly"" countries must pay for gas using the Russian currency, a move the EU considers blackmail. Reliance on Russian energy is a contributing factor in the cost-of-living crisis faced by many consumers. Finland imports most of its gas from Russia but gas accounts for less than a tenth of the country's energy consumption. On Saturday, the Finnish state-owned company Gasgrid Finland said in a statement that gas supplies through the Imatra entry point were stopped on 21 May. ""The amount of gas needed by the Finnish gas market is imported into the Finnish gas system through Balticconnector entry point in accordance with the nominations made by the market parties. Gasgrid Finland has directed gas imports in Balticconnector and the gas system is currently in balance,"" it said. Earlier, the Finnish state-owned energy firm Gasum described the Russian move as ""highly regrettable"". ""However, we have been carefully preparing for this situation and provided that there will be no disruptions in the gas transmission network, we will be able to supply all our customers with gas in the coming months,"" Gasum CEO Mika Wiljanen said in a statement. Asked about the matter, a Kremlin spokesman said ""it is obvious that nobody is going to deliver anything for free"". Last Sunday, Russia also cut electricity supplies to Finland. It had threatened retaliation should Finland apply to join Nato. In a separate development, Russia's state-owned oil company Rosneft said on Friday that former German Chancellor Gerhard Schröder had informed them he would no longer serve on their board. Mr Schröder has faced increasing public outrage over the lucrative role. He has refused to criticise Russia's President Vladimir Putin, who he counts as a personal friend, over his decision to invade Ukraine. "

Knuckles white, he holds the steering wheel tightly as the van jolts down mud tracks and through undergrowth. These paths were once used by tractors or for scenic bike trips. Now any inch of them or the open fields could be mined, hit by shells or surrounded by military. Alexander is just one of the volunteer drivers crossing the front line to evacuate civilians from Kherson and other Russian-controlled areas in eastern Ukraine. Quietly spoken, in his early twenties, he used to work in advocacy before the war. ""We can go along one road on the way in, but by the time we go back there's a crater from an explosion,"" he tells me. ""Then we know that the enemy shells have arrived. Then we pray, you can shell a little to the left, a little to the right. Just leave us a corridor in the middle so we can get people out."" In the last few weeks the volunteers say they have seen more demand from people wanting to leave Kherson as Russia tightens its grip on occupied territory. Arrivals tell stories of intimidation by Russian police, soaring food prices and fear of kidnap by the authorities. Despite the risks, they say, many still want to make the journey out. Evacuating the city has been difficult. The UN and the Red Cross told us they have not run any evacuation routes as they've been unable to get safety guarantees from both sides. Instead, volunteer drivers like Alexander negotiate the checkpoints and routes without any formal agreements. We are using false names for both drivers travelling into Kherson to protect their identities. ""You must have a cold mind and a firm heart,"" says Oleg. ""Otherwise, you won't get to the final destination."" Oleg used to be a builder. He greets us with a broad smile and a piece of salted fish, a gift from Kherson that he carried in the glove compartment. He returned last night. It was a tough journey. ""Every new ride gets harder and harder. The old routes are closed and we must look for new ones."" Oleg explains the process he follows, checking all the passengers' passports and documents, carrying a first aid kit. But following a plan is nearly impossible. For the last two days they arrived at the checkpoint at 05:00, only to wait until evening along with what he estimates to be around 2,000 other vehicles. No one, he says, was let through. ""We decided to go the way that is not yet open, because there are active battles there. It's a very fast route and because the women and children were so exhausted, we had to take risks. It was agreed by all passengers."" The team was lucky. Two other vans are still in Kherson, trying to make the journey out. One is driven by Alexander. They haven't been heard from since last night. The drivers are part of a volunteer organisation that sprung up from a Telegram channel called Odessa As It Is. In the group's evacuation hub, volunteers pile vegetables, fruit, bread, cereals and nappies into rescue packs for new arrivals. Julia Pogrebnaya, one of the key co-ordinators here, flicks anxiously through her phone as she shows us around. Normally the first to smile and laugh, today she is tense. ""I don't sleep,"" she says. ""I feel like I can't breathe out until the drivers are back. I worry about everything. We have a lot of responsibility."" Does she worry that they are encouraging people to take big risks? ""We have to do it. As we speak now we have about 5,500 people on the list that want to be evacuated from Kherson, not even counting from the surrounding villages."" Julia tells us she will let us know about the drivers. As we leave, I spot her sitting at her desk, one hand holding her phone, the other brushing away tears. It was the first day of the war when Puryshev Mykhailo made the decision to go to Mariupol. He arrived with humanitarian products and left with evacuees. That was the first of his seven trips. ""If I had waited for a safe corridor, I probably would have waited until now,"" he tells me. ""After I spent six days in a bomb shelter watching what children in the city were going through, something broke in me. At that moment I decided I would continue to do these trips. ""I just do it because I feel like it needs to be done. And to be honest, I would never have imagined that I was capable of such a thing."" Puryshev has filmed much of the last few weeks, from the smiling faces of the children he's evacuated to sheltering from shelling during a pick-up. ""Driving through the road, it can be difficult to distinguish what is dirt and what is a corpse,"" he says quietly. ""Sometimes it is both mixed together. I saw bodies wrapped in carpets, others buried right next to the entrance of the house. You try not to dwell on it because you have a goal, to take people out alive."" In Odessa, there is news of the drivers. After frantic calls to the military, the hub have heard that both drivers were hit. Following the same path Oleg had taken a few hours before, one driver was in Russian territory, they tell us, when he was shelled. He is in hospital in Ukrainian-held territory with a severe head injury, his skull fractured and part of his ear severed. One passenger died, another is also in hospital. A few hours later, Alexander left Kherson travelling in convoy with a car, only to come across a tank that turned them back. The driver of the car, Alexander's friend, was shot in the head by a sniper. Alexander survived, rescuing a passenger from the car to his van before escaping through shelling. When I speak to Julia, the team is shaken, but say they will continue. ""We had calls from people, crying for us to come,"" she tells me. ""We have no choice, but to help them."" "

The last fighters defending the city's Azovstal steel plant have now surrendered, Moscow officials said. For months the troops had been holed up in the huge complex, preventing Russia from establishing complete control over the city. Friday's evacuation marks the end of the most destructive siege of the war, with Mariupol now in complete ruins. The city and its steel plant are now ""completely liberated"" after 531 Ukrainian troops left the site, the Russian defence ministry said. ""The underground facilities of the enterprise, where the militants were hiding, came under the full control of the Russian armed forces,"" it added in a statement. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said the site's last remaining defenders had been given permission to leave. ""Today the boys received a clear signal from the military command that they can get out and save their lives,"" he told a Ukrainian television channel earlier on Friday. For weeks the Azovstal site had been completely encircled. Russian forces blocked all humanitarian aid from entering, bombarded the site from the air and demanded its remaining defenders put down their weapons. Many of those trapped inside were civilians, including women, children and elderly people. Earlier this month they were completely evacuated following painstaking negotiations coordinated by the UN and Red Cross that lasted for weeks. But the continued refusal of the site's Ukrainian defenders to surrender meant Russia was unable to command complete control over the strategic port city. For many Ukrainians, it also turned the Azovstal defenders into national heroes who symbolised the country's stubborn resistance. The hundreds of soldiers holed up inside included marines, the National Guard (including the Azov regiment), border guards, police and territorial defence units. Camped out with diminishing food supplies and no water, they lived for weeks in underground bunkers and tunnels without seeing daylight. The sprawling four-square-mile complex is a maze of tunnels designed to survive a nuclear war. Their commander said all wounded troops had now been taken away by Russian buses and ambulances. According to Moscow officials, Friday's evacuation means a total of 2,439 Ukrainian fighters have now surrendered from the steel works in recent days. Moscow has released no information about where the soldiers who left on Friday are being evacuated to, but previous buses have been sent to Russian-controlled territories. A video released by the Russian defence ministry, which the BBC has been unable to verify, appears to show a line of unarmed men approaching Russian soldiers outside the plant and giving their names. The Russians then carefully search each man and their possessions. Ukrainian officials hope they can be released as part of a prisoner exchange but that has not been confirmed by Moscow. Russian President Vladimir Putin said the soldiers would be treated ""in line with the relevant international laws"", but there is concern over what will happen to them if they remain in Russian custody. However, on Tuesday Russian lawmakers put forward plans to declare Azov regiment fighters ""Nazi criminals"" who must not be part of any prisoner swap with Ukraine. The Azov regiment, set up as a volunteer militia in 2014 but now a National Guard unit, once had links to the far right. Meanwhile, the office of Russia's prosecutor general has asked the country's Supreme Court to declare the unit a ""terrorist organisation"" in an apparent attempt to prevent its fighters being treated as conventional prisoners of war.

It is worth remembering that many people, including perhaps Russian President Vladimir Putin, did not expect it to last this long. But instead of swiftly taking the capital Kyiv, Russia faced strong resistance and last month switched focus to trying to capture the eastern region known as the Donbas. A US foreign policy adviser, Derek Chollet, says Russia has already suffered a ""strategic defeat"". ""Ukraine is stronger today and closer to the West,"" Mr Chollet says. ""And Nato is stronger as well."" Despite this, fighting continues and shows no sign of ending, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has said the Donbas region has been ""completely destroyed"". You can see the latest mapping of the war here. Mr Zelensky has also condemned a missile strike against a cultural centre in the Kharkiv region that reportedly injured seven people including an 11-year-old child, describing it as ""absolute evil, absolute stupidity"". ""What is in the heads of people who choose such targets?"" he said. Central to Russian ambitions in Ukraine has been the city of Mariupol, which connects its eastern regions to the annexed Crimea. Soldiers at the Azovstal steelworks - the last part of the city still in Ukrainian hands - say they have finally ended their defence. They had vowed to fight until the end, but eventually were told they could get out and save their lives. Since Monday, hundreds have left the site and taken to Russian-controlled towns. The exact number is not yet clear, though Russia claims almost 2,000 have surrendered. What will happen next is still not clear.

Both claim to have made recent gains. But they've also suffered setbacks. That pattern of costly gains and losses is now being repeated in the east of the country. Russia has been making small but steady advances in the Donbas - the renewed focus of its offensive.

Russia's deputy prime minister has vowed to sell power from the sprawling Zaporizhzhia plant in the south of the country back to Ukraine - and if it won't pay, he said, then the electricity could be sent to Russia instead. But a spokesman for Ukraine's state nuclear agency Energoatom told the BBC it would take years to link the plant to Russia. The BBC's Laurence Peter has more on this Russia still exports large amounts of gas to Europe, despite being under unprecedented sanctions.

206,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-61524175,2022-05-20T19:44:12,Ukraine war: What might tip the balance?," Russia's war in Ukraine has become an increasingly grinding and bloody affair, with each side wearing the other down. Both claim to have made recent gains. But they've also suffered setbacks. Overall, Russia is still the dominant force and has significant military might - but there has been no swift victory as planned. Here, we take a closer look at some of the things which could tilt the outcome in favour of either party. In the north, a Ukrainian counter-offensive has successfully pushed back Russian forces from the city of Kharkiv. In the south, Russia has all but cleared out the final pockets of resistance in the port city of Mariupol. Both have been costly in terms of military and civilian casualties, but neither is likely to prove decisive. What's happened in Mariupol and Kharkiv highlights the ebb and flow of this conflict. That pattern of costly gains and losses is now being repeated in the east of the country. Russia has been making small but steady advances in the Donbas - the renewed focus of its offensive. But it's also suffered setbacks - as highlighted by the destruction earlier this month of dozens of Russian armoured vehicles trying to cross the Siversky Donets river. In the east, each side is exchanging heavy, grinding blows using artillery. Ben Barry, a former British Army brigadier who is now with the International Institute for Strategic Studies, says that will continue to be the case in the battle of the Donbas. He predicts artillery will be the main cause of casualties on both sides for weeks and months to come. Western officials have highlighted significant Russian losses, but they have been less willing to give estimates of Ukrainian casualties. Ukraine is now receiving Western-supplied heavy weapons - including US M777 howitzers. It has also been sent counter-artillery radar systems - to help find and target Russia's artillery lines. But Ukraine is still outgunned. Russia has been using its artillery and rocket launchers to tie down Ukrainian forces who are dug in - along well prepared defensive lines. Russia has been pressing from two main directions - from Izyum in the north and from the west around the city of Severedonetsk. They have made limited advances in both directions. Brig Barry says it appears that Russia is ""trying to bleed Ukraine dry"" by forcing it to concentrate its forces at key points, which can then be targeted by its artillery. Military analysts believe Ukraine is likely to have suffered significant casualties as a result. However, he says Ukraine will still be able to use urban areas in the Donbas to slow down Russia's advances. Fighting in town and cities, as has been shown throughout this war, favours the defender. Once again, as in Mariupol, Russia is likely to try to grind resistance down - with the now familiar pattern of using mass artillery strikes until there remains little to defend. Ukraine's President Zelensky has already said Ukraine's eastern Donbas region has been ""completely destroyed"" and has described life there as ""hell"". It's going to get worse. Military experts though still believe that Russia lacks the number of troops it needs to make significant advances in the east. Redeploying forces from the fight in Kharkiv and Mariupol is unlikely to make a difference. Jack Watling, of the Royal United Services Institute, says Russia is still short of manpower and in particular infantry. Russia has tried to reconstruct and combine some of its already battered units - dubbed ""Frankenstein's Forces"". Unit cohesion and morale of tired and depleted units is likely to be poor. A recent UK Ministry of Defence intelligence assessment concluded that Russian commanders were facing pressure to achieve results quickly and as a result were likely to redistribute forces without adequate preparation. The ministry said that risked ""further attrition"". It is already claimed that Russia has already lost around a third of its original invasion force - an estimate that includes killed and wounded troops as well as equipment destroyed or damaged. Mr Watling says Russia is trying to address these shortages - including mobilising reserves who are over 40 years old and offering short-term contracts to fill its ranks. But training and rebuilding an army takes time. Russia has also proved vulnerable to Ukrainian attacks on its supply lines. But Ukraine's capacity to do this is likely to be limited with the bulk of its forces tied down in defensive positions. No one thinks this war will be over quickly. It's not yet a stalemate. Russia is making advances - but very slowly. But the outcome of this war is unlikely to depend on military might alone. Mr Watling says Russia is also pursuing economic and political levers to inflict as much damage on Ukraine as possible. While Russia's economy is taking a hit from Western sanctions, Ukraine's is likely to suffer even more. Russia's GDP is expected to shrink by 12% over the next year, but Ukraine's GDP could fall by 50%. Russia's blockade of the Black Sea is causing significant damage. Mr Watling says continuing Western economic, as well as military, support could prove crucial. Will the public's interest in the war wane the longer it goes on - just as it did after 2014 when Russia annexed Crimea and Russian-backed separatists first seized parts of the Donbas? Western governments now also have to worry about their own domestic challenges, including rising inflation, gas and oil prices and a cost of living crisis - caused in part by the war. When winter approaches it will be harder for armies to fight. It may also prove more difficult for the world to weather an economic storm. "

The nationwide shortage is due to a lack of mustard seeds needed to produce the condiment. Severe drought in Canada, poor harvests in France and the war in Ukraine have combined to reduce the supplies of mustard seeds available to producers. The price of mustard has shot up by 10% in France as a result, and some shops are struggling to restock jars. Canada, where France imports many of its mustard seeds from, was hit by drought last year that collapsed crop yields in the country's agricultural west. Not all droughts are due to climate change, but excess heat in the atmosphere is drawing more moisture out of the earth and making droughts worse. The world has already warmed by about 1.2C since since the industrial era began and temperatures will keep rising unless governments around the world make steep cuts to emissions. Meanwhile in France domestic mustard seed harvests have fallen short of expectations for three years in a row, most recently due to a wet winter and cold spring. Luc Vondermaeson, who is managing director of France's third-largest mustard manufacturer La Reine de Dijon, told the BBC that production was running at 20-25% below normal. Seeds could still be found in January and February, he said, but availability had dwindled since then. ""The market is totally empty. Everything has been booked and we have difficulty obtaining seeds."" French producers had originally hoped to import additional mustard seeds from Russia or Ukraine to make up for the shortfall, but since the invasion this has no longer been possible. The war has disrupted global supply chains for many agricultural products. Russia's attacks on and blockade of Ukraine's Black Sea ports and Western sanctions on Moscow have combined to severely limit the amount of food either country is exporting to the rest of the world. Earlier this week the United Nations warned that the invasion could cause a global food crisis lasting for years.. And in the UK, disruption of supplies of sunflower oil from Ukraine last month led to supermarkets limiting how many bottles of cooking oil customers could buy. "
208,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-61521540,2022-05-20T17:51:29,"Northern Ireland: UK and EU's row risks Western unity, top US official warns"," The UK's dispute with the European Union over Northern Ireland trade risks undermining Western unity during the Ukraine war, a senior US official says. Derek Chollet told the BBC the US hoped the row over Northern Ireland's post-Brexit trade deal could be resolved. He said ""a big fight between the UK and the EU"" was ""the last thing"" Washington wanted. Vladimir Putin would ""use any opportunity he can to show that our alliance is fraying"", he added. Mr Chollet, the most senior adviser to US Secretary of State, Anthony Blinken, said: ""We want to see this issue resolved and we want to see the temperature lowered and no unilateral acts. ""And it's particularly important right now where we need to send a message of unity to the world and not undermine all the things that we've been so successful in working on together over the last several months and showing unity in Ukraine."" Mr Chollet's intervention is significant. It is rare for senior US officials to comment on the UK's domestic affairs given the historically close relationship between the two nations. But his comments build on recent concerns expressed by senior US politicians, including President Joe Biden and US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, about the UK government threatening to override the Northern Ireland Protocol. These concerns have so far largely focused on what the US sees as the possible risks to peace in Northern Ireland. But the senior State Department official is making a new argument, that now is not the time for the UK and the EU to be having a fight. There are bigger fish to fry over Ukraine. The US wants its allies united, not scrapping over legacy Brexit issues. Read more: Guide to the Brexit border problem On Thursday Ms Pelosi said she was ""deeply concerned"" that the UK was seeking to ""unilaterally discard"" Northern Ireland's post-Brexit trade arrangements, set out in the protocol. She said the US Congress would not support a trade agreement with the UK if its actions jeopardised the peace process in Northern Ireland. The UK government has argued that changes to the way goods are shipped from Great Britain to Northern Ireland are needed to restore its devolved government. A power-sharing administration cannot be formed without the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), which has refused to join one until significant changes are made to the protocol. The DUP says the protocol, which was agreed by the UK and the EU in December 2020, has created economic barriers between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. On Tuesday Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said the UK government would introduce a law to change the protocol unilaterally should negotiations with the EU fail. Ms Pelosi warned against any action that might endanger the Good Friday Agreement, the peace deal that ended decades of conflict in Northern Ireland. In the first of several tweets, she wrote: ""Ensuring there is no physical border between the Irish Republic and Northern Ireland is necessary for upholding this landmark agreement, which transformed Northern Ireland."" But the UK's former Brexit minister, Lord Frost, has criticised Ms Pelosi for making what he called an ""ignorant"" statement about the situation in Northern Ireland. Lord Frost, who negotiated the protocol with the EU, said there was no plan to put a physical border in place on the island of Ireland. ""Nobody's ever suggested that. So I don't know why she's suggesting that in her statement,"" Lord Frost told the Week in Westminster on BBC Radio 4. He also denied that making changes to the arrangements would undermine the Good Friday Agreement. ""It is the protocol itself that's undermining [the Good Friday Agreement] and people who can't see that really shouldn't be commenting on the situation in Northern Ireland,"" said the former minister. On Friday afternoon DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said he thought Ms Pelosi's contributions were ""entirely unhelpful, offer no solution, offer no help and merely repeat a mantra that frankly is hopelessly out of date."" He spoke as the Irish Taoiseach Micheál Martin met Northern Ireland's main parties to discuss the protocol and the political crisis. Meanwhile, a US Congress delegation flew to Brussels for a meeting with European Commission vice-president Maros Sefcovic, who has been leading negotiations with the UK. ""We're equally committed to protecting the Good Friday (Belfast) Agreement,"" he tweeted. ""Joint solutions implementing the Protocol are the only way to do so."" "

Russian troops are occupying the sprawling Zaporizhzhia plant by the Dnieper River in southern Ukraine. It is Europe's biggest nuclear plant. The Ukrainian staff are still operating it, but Russia has sent its own nuclear experts to monitor their work. Russia's deputy prime minister has vowed to sell power from it to Ukraine. Marat Khusnullin said Russia would integrate the Zaporizhzhia plant with Russia's energy system if Kyiv refused to pay for the plant's electricity. Visiting Russian-occupied southern Ukraine on Wednesday he said ""if the Ukrainian energy system is ready to receive [electricity] and pay for it, then we'll work, but if not - then the plant will work for Russia"". However a spokesman for Ukraine's state nuclear agency Energoatom said it would take years to link the plant to Russia. ""The plant only works in Ukraine's energy grid,"" Leonid Oliynyk told the BBC. ""The Russians can build a power line theoretically, but it will take a long time, like their Crimean bridge - several years,"" he said, referring to the bridge connecting Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014, to Russian territory. ""Now the power station is working at a minimum level, but Kyiv remains in charge, all the power lines are controlled by Ukraine. The Russian statement is wishful thinking,"" Mr Oliynyk added. Normally the plant generates more than half of Ukraine's nuclear power and 20% of the country's total electricity supply. But now just two of its six reactors are operating. Ukrainian forces still control the city of Zaporizhzhia, on the opposite bank of the Dnieper. The nuclear power plant is in Enerhodar, a town of nearly 53,000 built in Soviet times to house the nuclear workers. There have been several protest rallies in Enerhodar against the Russian occupation, violently broken up by Russian security forces with tear gas and stun grenades. During his visit Mr Khusnullin said ""I think this region's future is to work in our friendly Russian family"". On 3 March Russian forces shelled the Zaporizhzhia plant, and later took control of it. Buildings around one of its reactors were damaged, according to Energoatom. The UN nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), said radiation levels and reactor safety were not affected. World leaders condemned Russia for the attack and Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky accused Russia of ""nuclear terror"". The IAEA says the situation at the plant now remains ""fragile"" and ""unsustainable"", as Russian troops keep the staff under tight surveillance, along with a team of experts from Rosatom - Russia's state nuclear agency. The IAEA says it is trying to negotiate an inspection visit to the site. Mr Oliynyk said ""the staff feel bad, because there's a lot of technical pressure on them, the Russians are behaving as occupiers"". He said Russia was keeping about 500 troops and 50 armoured vehicles at the site. ""They're checking documents, they don't let people speak freely and break up meetings in Enerhodar."" He insisted that Ukraine ""will liberate the whole territory - no deals with the occupiers"". Russia's temporary occupation of Chernobyl in northern Ukraine - site of the world's worst nuclear disaster in 1986 - also alarmed world leaders. The radiation level at the decommissioned plant is reported to be stable and within safe limits, but there are hotspots in places nearby where Russian soldiers dug trenches. There have been some forest fires in the exclusion zone around the plant - not directly threatening it, Mr Oliynyk said. But he added: ""Firefighters cannot go there as so many mines were laid, it's too dangerous."" After Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea and parts of the Donbas region, he said, Ukraine stockpiled nuclear fuel, so now it has enough to last two years. Ukraine now has a deal with US power company Westinghouse to provide nuclear fuel, with the goal of replacing the 40% of nuclear fuel that Kyiv still gets from Moscow. "

Emma Foot grows rapeseed on her 500-acre farm at Bere Regis in Dorset. She said fewer farmers were growing the crop since a ban on a key pesticide in 2013 but said she was willing to take the risk of the crop failing. The war in Ukraine has seen exports of sunflower oil plummet in recent months, leading to a world-wide shortage. That has seen consumers turn to alternative cooking oils, but in recent years UK farmers have planted less oilseed rape following the pesticide ban brought in to protect bees. The chemicals were outlawed by the EU after research suggested they were damaging bees' brains but it led to a surge in flea beetles and major crop losses. The subsequent collapse in rapeseed farming in the UK has led to a reliance on imported oils from other countries. Ms Foot said while growing oilseed rape was ""challenging"" it would reduce the UK's dependency on foreign imports. Ms Foot, who devotes 130 acres to growing rapeseed, said: ""I do find it a little bit backwards that we're importing from countries such as Australia which are using seed dressings that we aren't allowed to use."" But the Bere Regis farmer was committed to growing the crop here, even though it ""does come at a risk"" after her crop was decimated by the flea beetle two years ago. The government said all agri-food products imported into the UK had to comply with import requirements. The Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) said: ""The amounts of pesticide residues that are permitted in food must be safe for consumers and must be as low as possible. ""Imported produce which has been treated with pesticides, including neonicotinoids, is permitted as long as the residues are within the maximum residue levels allowed."" DEFRA added there was ""ongoing monitoring"" of pesticide residues. Recent figures by Data by NielsenIQ Scantrack showed the cost of sunflower oil had risen to £1.34 per litre. Exports from Russia and Ukraine account for 55% of the global supply, according to the United Nations food agency but the war has had a major impact on exports. Ms Foot said farmers here had suffered from increased costs just as the general public had: ""Fuel being 40p previously is now about £1 for red diesel, fertiliser was £270 a tonne, now it's about £1000. ""So, it is quite a hit really because you're just dealing with more money, you're not getting any more."" The farmer said if local businesses would buy the homegrown rapeseed it would be a ""really good USP for them"". Follow BBC South on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram.

The firm has several company homes and a former hotel in Uttoxeter, Staffordshire, which it has prepared for women and children fleeing the conflict. The first refugees, Nataliia Stepanenko and her two children, arrived in May. But JCB chairman Lord Bamford said the government needs to act more swiftly. ""There is a crisis going on and it needs to be seen as a crisis and can we help,"" he said. ""We are saying publicly and politicians are saying they will help but then you come to the regulations and regulations don't allow it to be treated in a hurry."" Ms Stepanenko and her children Diana, 21, and Denis, 16, fled their apartment in the city of Boryspil, near the Ukrainian capital Kyiv, in February. Her husband, Serhii, works for JCB in Ukraine but has been conscripted into his country's army. The construction firm said Ms Stepanenko and her children took up their offer of a home near their headquarters in Staffordshire. Ms Stepanenko said she was surprised by the proposal from another country but ""it is OK, as people in Uttoxeter are real friendly"". JCB also owns a former Travelodge in Uttoxeter which it said is being prepared for a large number of families. A Ukrainian employee who works in their Rocester plant in Staffordshire, Viktor Melnykevic, said he would help welcome the refugees. He still has family in Ukraine, including his 68-year-old mother, and said: """"When I go to bed I can't sleep properly. My missus said don't watch too many news about Ukraine because after that I think more, I worry."" Responding to Lord Bamford's frustrations, a government spokesman said it was grateful for all offers of support and would work with groups as ""we expand the scheme in a phased way"".

Both countries submitted their applications to be part of the Western defence alliance this week, marking a major shift in European geopolitics. To join the alliance, the two nations need the support of all 30 Nato member states. But the move by the Nordic nations has been opposed by Turkey. Speaking alongside Swedish Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson and Finnish President Sauli Niinisto at the White House on Thursday, Mr Biden called Sweden and Finland's applications ""a watershed moment in European security"". ""New members joining Nato is not a threat to any nation,"" he said. The president added that having two new members in the ""high north"" would ""enhance the security of our allies and deepen our security co-operation across the board"". Russia has repeatedly said it sees Nato as a threat and has warned of ""consequences"" if the block proceeds with its expansion plans. Turkey has accused both Sweden and Finland of hosting suspected militants from the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), a group it views as a terrorist organisation. However, both Nato Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg and British Defence Minister Ben Wallace have expressed confidence that these concerns will eventually be addressed. Mr Biden's comments came as the US Senate voted to approve a new $40bn (£32bn) bill to provide military and humanitarian aid to Ukraine. It is the biggest emergency aid package so far for Ukraine. The bill - which was passed by the House of Representatives with broad bipartisan support on 10 May - was expected to be passed earlier this week, but was blocked by Kentucky Republican Rand Paul over a dispute about spending oversight. But the Republican's Senate leader Mitch McConnell dismissed these concerns and told reporters that Congress had a ""moral responsibility"" to support ""a sovereign democracy's self-defence"". ""Anyone concerned about the cost of supporting a Ukrainian victory should consider the much larger cost should Ukraine lose,"" Mr McConnell said. Last week, Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin and Secretary of State Antony Blinken urged Congress to approve the package and warned that the US military only had enough funds to send weapons to Kyiv until 19 May. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky praised the aid package as ""a significant US contribution to the restoration of peace and security in Ukraine, Europe and the world"". The package brings the total US aid delivered to Ukraine to more than $50bn, including $6bn for security assistance such as training, equipment, weapons and support. Another $8.7bn will be allocated to replenish stocks of US equipment already sent to Ukraine. "

There is not a great deal to see here, apart from the chicken farm and the church that was reduced to rubble in World War Two. But there is one thing in this town that is particularly eye-catching: the local shopping centre. Dmitry Skurikhin owns the building - and you should see what he's done to the front of it. In giant letters he's painted ""Peace to Ukraine, Freedom to Russia!"" In bright-red paint he's listed the names of Ukrainian towns that have been attacked by the Russian army. Mariupol, Bucha, Kherson, Chernihiv, and many more. ""I thought this would be a good way of getting information out,"" Dmitry tells me. ""Because for the first few weeks of the war our people didn't know what was happening. They thought that some kind of special operation was being conducted to remove drug addicts from the Ukrainian government. They didn't know that Russia was shelling Ukrainian towns."" Dmitry has even turned the roof of his shop into a giant yellow and blue Ukrainian flag. Suddenly, out comes a paint pot and brush and Dmitry adds more names. Borodyanka, Odesa, Irpin… The excess paint drips down the wall, blood red, making this statement all the more powerful. Dmitry knows that what he's doing is not without risk. In Russia public protest often ends in prosecution or threats. Or both. Someone has already graffitied ""traitor"" on his door. And the police have been round to visit. He was later fined for discrediting the Russian armed forces. Dmitry is unrepentant. ""I couldn't just sit doing nothing. It would have torn me apart inside. But what I am doing is an act of desperation. Now Russians are outcasts. We deserve to be. This offensive will cast a shadow over us for a long time."" The Kremlin likes to portray President Vladimir Putin as a leader who is supported by his people. The authorities insist that Russians back him on Ukraine. Dmitry claims it is an illusion. ""If you ask people here, are they in favour of war between Russia and Ukraine, with the shelling of towns, plus all the consequences like poverty and hunger, they would say: 'Are you mad?!'"" Dmitry tells me. ""Russians are being exposed to disinformation. They support the special military operation that they're being told about on TV. But people are starting to realise that what's really happening is a calamity."" Outside the shopping centre, I ask passers-by what they think of Dmitry's paint protest. ""He's an idiot. An idiot! Covering the wall with that dog's dinner!"" exclaims one shopper. ""He'd have been better off painting a picture on the wall!"" The next person I ask happens to be Dmitry's 87-year-old former biology teacher from school. ""No one wants war, I still remember World War Two,"" says Maria Nikolaevena. ""But it's all very well saying we don't want war. Perhaps our government knows better."" ""He has the right to express his opinion,"" says a young man called Anton. ""And I'm worried, too, about Ukraine, because attacking, bombing a neighbouring country is a strange thing to do."" Dmitry Skurikhin knows that paint will not bring peace. But if his protest makes people in the town stop, think, even question, then it will - he believes - have been worthwhile. "

On the ground in Ukraine, Russia said nearly 800 more fighters from the besieged steelworks in Mariupol had surrendered in the past 24 hours. It is unclear how many fighters remain at the site. The fall of the port city represents a strategic victory for Moscow, which is pressing on with its main offensive in the eastern Donbas region. Former US President George W Bush has accidentally condemned Vladimir Putin's invasion of ""Iraq"", before correcting himself by saying he was talking about Ukraine. Mr Bush made the gaffe during a speech at an event in Dallas, Texas, where he was talking about the importance of fair elections. He made a reference to the Russian leader's ""wholly unjustified and brutal invasion of Iraq... I mean of Ukraine"". Mr Bush was the president during the US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003, which was justified due to weapons of mass destruction that were never found. Russia has claimed to be using laser weapons in Ukraine - one of which burned up a Ukrainian drone within five seconds, at a distance of 5km (three miles). But the US said it had not seen anything to corroborate this.

215,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-61511640,2022-05-19T17:38:11,Ukrainian widow confronts Russian soldier accused of killing her husband," In the very first days of this invasion a 62-year-old unarmed civilian was shot dead on a village street outside his Ukrainian home. His name was Oleksandr Shelipov. Three months later and the captured Russian soldier accused of killing him is in Kyiv being tried for a war crime. Standing up in court to confront the 21-year-old defendant on Thursday was Kateryna Shelipova, the widow of the man killed. Did he repent his crime, she asked? The Russian tank commander, Vadim Shishimarin, replied that he admitted his guilt and asked for her forgiveness. ""But I understand you won't be able to forgive me,"" he added. Kateryna Shelipova hadn't finished. ""Tell me please, why did you [Russians] come here? To protect us?"" she asked, citing Vladimir Putin's justification for the invasion of Ukraine. ""Protect us from whom? Did you protect me from my husband, whom you killed?"" The soldier had no answer to that. This landmark trial marks the first time a Russian serviceman has been put on the stand for war crimes since the invasion of Ukraine was launched in February. And perhaps such raw encounters are what such trials are about, at least in part. Forcing a soldier - who ignored all the rules of war - to face up to exactly what he has done and the suffering he has caused. Sgt Shishimarin has pleaded guilty and Ukrainian prosecutors are asking for him to be sentenced to life imprisonment. On Wednesday, Ms Shelipova told me she actually felt sorry for the soldier, but she could not forgive him for this crime. She heard the shots that killed her husband, then saw Sgt Shishimarin through her gate - holding his weapon. Five minutes later she says she saw her husband's body: ""He was dead with a shot in his head. I started screaming very loudly."" ""The loss of my husband is everything for me,"" Ms Shelipova said, adding: ""He was my protector."" Recalling the events of 28 February, Vadim Shishimarin said he and a small group of other Russian soldiers had become separated from their unit and hijacked a car in order to return to it. ""As we were driving, we saw a man. He was talking on the phone,"" the defendant said. He claimed that he hadn't wanted to fire the fatal shots, that he was following orders - threatened by another soldier if he refused to do as he was told. ""He said I would be putting us in danger if I didn't. I shot him at short range. It killed him,"" the 21-year-old tank commander told the court. Interestingly, his defence lawyer - appointed by the state - told me that no Russian official has been in touch with him, including from its defence ministry. There is no Russian embassy in Kyiv these days, so no contact from there either. President Vladimir Putin's spokesman yesterday told the BBC that the Kremlin has ""no information"" about this case. All in all, it feels rather like the young soldier has been abandoned to his fate by the commanders who sent him to war and continue to deny that their forces commit crimes here. We also heard from a second Russian soldier who witnessed the killing in February and later surrendered to Ukrainian forces. Ivan Maltysev, another slight and young-looking 21-year-old, told the court how the Russian soldiers spotted Oleksandr Shelipov while they were driving the stolen car. Mr Maltysev claimed that Vadim Shishimarin was then ordered to shoot the victim because he was on the phone. ""Vadim didn't do it. So the soldier, whose name I don't know, turned round in the car and shouted that Vadim had to carry out the order, or we would be informed on. ""At this point, we were almost alongside the civilian and, under pressure, Vadim fired. He fired three or four rounds."" Ukraine has so far identified more than 11,000 possible war crimes committed by Russia. Moscow has denied its troops have targeted civilians, but investigators have been collecting evidence of possible war crimes to bring before the International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague. This trial is Ukraine's chance to prove, beyond doubt, that a Russian soldier killed a civilian with no regard for the rules of war. Its prosecutors know they are in the spotlight, proceeding so quickly, and in the middle of a war. That is why they are keen to be as transparent and thorough as possible - so that this is not seen as a show trial, but part of a vital quest for justice. "
216,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-61508922,2022-05-19T16:37:06,Russia's laser weapon claim derided as propaganda," Russia claims to have used laser weapons on the battlefield in Ukraine, although the US says it has seen no evidence of this and Ukraine has derided it as propaganda. What are laser weapons and how effective could they be in the conflict? Yury Borisov, the deputy prime minister in charge of military development, told Russian TV that a laser prototype called Zadira was being deployed in Ukraine and had burned up a Ukrainian drone within five seconds at a distance of 5km (three miles). This was in addition to a previous laser system called Peresvet - named after a medieval Orthodox warrior monk - which could be used to dazzle satellites orbiting high above Earth and prevent them from gathering information. ""If Peresvet blinds, then the new generation of laser weapons lead to the physical destruction of the target - thermal destruction, they burn up,"" Mr Borisov said. However, an official with the US Department of Defense said he had not seen ""anything to corroborate reports of lasers being used"" in Ukraine. Meanwhile, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky mocked the Russian claim, comparing it to the so-called ""wonder weapons"" that Nazi Germany claimed to be developing during World War Two. ""The clearer it became that they had no chance in the war, the more propaganda there was about an amazing weapon that would be so powerful as to ensure a turning point,"" he said in a video address. ""And so we see that in the third month of a full-scale war, Russia is trying to find its 'wonder weapon'... this all clearly shows the complete failure of the mission."" Little is known about the Zadira laser programme, but in 2017 Russian media said state nuclear corporation Rosatom had helped develop it as part of a programme to create weapons based on new physical principles, news agency Reuters reported. But there is at least one country which has developed a laser weapon. Last month Israel released video showing a laser system shooting down rockets and drones. Prime Minister Naftali Bennett said it could shoot down drones, mortars and rockets for just $3.50 (£2.80) a shot. ""It may sound like science fiction, but it's real,"" he said. But missile defence expert Dr Uzi Rubin from the Jerusalem Institute for Strategy and Security (JISS) said laser weapon technology would not alter the balance of power on the battlefield in Ukraine. ""Zelensky is right - it's no wonder weapon,"" he told the BBC. ""It took them several seconds to shoot the UAV down. There are much better ways to do it, to use a Stinger or any anti-aircraft missile would have been cheaper, faster and longer range."" Lasers work by sending out a beam of infrared light that heats up its target until it combusts. Dr Rubin said the power of even advanced laser weapons was still too weak to make a significant difference on the battlefield, and such weapons had a low ""kill rate"". ""It's not like in Star Wars where they point a laser gun at the bad guys and quickly push a button and the bad guy explodes. In reality, it's more like a mere microwave oven. If you want to make a cup of water boil it takes some time. The laser is the same. You need to put it on the target and wait until it heats up and destroys it,"" he said. The laser can only focus on one target at a time, Dr Rubin said, while missile defence systems can engage multiple incoming targets simultaneously. Additionally, lasers are neutralised by bad weather because they don't work in rain or snow and cannot penetrate cloud. However Israel's ""Iron Beam"" does have a rationale, he said, but mainly as a way of saving money. Israel's expensive Iron Dome interceptor missiles are designed to protect major cities from incoming missiles, rather than mortar rounds or drones. ""Missile warfare is a war of resources. It's cheaper to make the rockets than to defend against them. So whatever you can do to reduce the costs of defending is useful,"" he said. ""Energy weapons can be useful in reducing costs - but it's not going to make a revolution."" Additionally, Russia could use lasers on the battlefield to blind Ukrainian soldiers, retired Australian army major general Mick Ryan told the Washington Post, although this is banned under a 1995 protocol added to the UN treaty that prohibits weapons causing excessive injury or having indiscriminate impact. Russia, the US, UK and others are signatories to the protocol. Mr Zelensky's reference to ""wonder weapons"" - Wunderwaffen - is about Nazi German propaganda disseminated at a time when the war was going badly for them. The propaganda ministry, run by Joseph Goebbels, tried to boost morale and keep Germans believing in victory by hinting that special new weapons were coming that would turn the war decisively in their favour. When the Nazis began firing their V-1 flying bomb at Britain, the Nazi propaganda machine began saying that it would force Britain to drop out of the war, according to Michael Neufeld, a senior curator at the Smithsonian Museum in Washington. ""The propaganda said we're going to get our revenge and turn this around. I'm not surprised at all that Zelensky might refer to this WW2 background,"" he told the BBC. There was disillusionment when that did not happen - but the idea that these new weapons could have proved decisive lives on even today, says Mr Neufeld, who says he has spent a career fighting it. However, he cautioned against drawing too direct a parallel with Russia heralding its laser weapon, saying that Moscow has consistently talked its weaponry up with its references to nuclear and hypersonic arms. ""It may be premature to see this as a case of being reactive because the war is going badly,"" he said. ""At the beginning of the war, they assumed that talking about these new weapons would intimidate and force Ukraine to quit. And now they may be turning it around and saying they are still superior."" "

Alexander Govor, who currently operates 25 McDonald's restaurants in Siberia, will take on the firm's restaurants and staff, operating them under a new brand, the fast food giant said. It did not disclose the sale price, but has warned investors it would take a more than $1bn hit from the exit. McDonald's had operated in Russia for more than 30 years. The opening of its first restaurant in Moscow in 1990 came to symbolise a thaw in Cold War tensions. A year later, the Soviet Union collapsed and Russia opened up its economy to companies from the West. More than three decades later, however, it is one of a growing number of corporations pulling out as the war in Ukraine and Western sanctions make it difficult to operate. McDonald's, which had nearly 850 restaurants in the country, most of them directly owned, said it expected the deal, which is subject to regulatory approval, to close in coming weeks. Mr Govor has been a licensee of McDonald's since 2015. He is also co-founder of Neftekhimservice, a refining company, and a board member of another firm that owns the Park Inn hotel and private clinics in Siberia. Russia's Industry and Trade Minister Denis Manturov said the deal was the result of a ""long and difficult"" negotiation process and the government would provide Mr Govor with all the necessary assistance to set up operations. The terms provide for McDonald's 62,000 staff in Russia to be retained for at least two years, with their existing pay and Mr Govor will pay the salaries of corporate staff in Russia until the deal is completed. McDonald's will retain its trademark in the country, it said, while the restaurants will be stripped of their menu, logo and other branding. Announcing plans for the sale earlier this week, chief executive Chris Kempczinski called the decision ""extremely difficult"". ""However, we have a commitment to our global community and must remain steadfast in our values. And our commitment to our values means that we can no longer keep the arches shining there,"" he said. McDonald's suspended operations at the restaurants it owned in Russia in March, citing the ""humanitarian crisis"" and ""unpredictable operating environment"" caused by the Ukraine war. The move drew outrage among Russian politicians and prompted threats the business would be seized. A patent application for an ""Uncle Vanya"" restaurant chain was filed with Russian authorities shortly after. The name, the same as the famous work by Russian playwright Anton Chekhov, was one of several brand knock-offs of Western companies to surface. Last year, Russia and Ukraine accounted for about 9% of McDonald's revenue. The move by McDonald's came after French carmaker Renault sold its majority stake in carmaker Aftovaz to a state research institute for a symbolic sum, while its Renault Russia business was taken over by the city of Moscow. Manufacturing at the Renault plant is expected to resume under a Soviet-era brand. "

Work led by by Rea Valley Methodist Churches group has started to convert Stiperstones' Methodist chapel into a family home for six. The site will hold an open day in June to encourage the community to support in any way they can. The Reverend Richard Hall said people wanted to offer ""practical help"". ""We have all been shocked and saddened by events in Ukraine,"" the superintendent minister added. The churches group, who also run chapels in Minsterley and Pontesbury, said they hoped to create ""a support network"". That support network has already begun within the community, as an anonymous donor gave £500 towards renovations. And local carpenter Ken Jones has been working for free by putting up partitions to create three bedrooms, said church treasurer Ed Mitton. The Methodist chapel stopped running services so it could become a retreat centre for visitors and hold occasional services and meetings. The group decided because it is the most modern out of the chapels that they run, it should be used to help a family from Ukraine. June Claire, a member of Minsterley chapel, said it had been a ""difficult and complicated process"", but added ""we are united in our determination to rescue a traumatised family and look after them here in safety"". Mr Hall hopes the chapel will be liveable within a matter of weeks, once some extra paper work has been finalised. Follow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

Vadim Shishimarin was asked by widow Kateryna Shalipov if he repented for the crime he committed. The 21-year-old soldier replied, ""Yes, I admit guilt... I apologise for everything I have done."" Prosecutors for the trial say Shishimarin was commanding a unit in a tank division when his convoy came under attack. He and four other soldiers stole a car, and as they travelled near Chupakhivka, they encountered the 62-year-old on a bicycle, they said. According to prosecutors, Shishimarin was ordered to kill the civilian and used a Kalashnikov assault rifle to do so. © 2022 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.

Kristina Korniiuk, 34, of Kyiv, arrived in Cambridge earlier this month and is being hosted by her best friend Rend Platings. Ms Platings' house has also been painted in the colours of the Ukraine flag. Vyshyvanka Day is held annually on the third Thursday of May. It aims to preserve the folk traditions of wearing ""vyshyvanka"" - or embroidered Ukrainian national dress. Patterns on the garments can represent a person's family background and regional heritage. Ms Korniiuk said she wanted to mark the day to ""show the world how beautiful we are and how proud we are and that in spite of the fear we believe in our victory"". She made the giant vyshyvanka shirt from a white flat bed sheet, painting on the patterns, and hopes seven people will fit inside it. Ms Korniiuk, who works as a Spanish teacher, said Vyshyvanka Day is a ""very important day in Ukraine"". ""Usually it's a very beautiful day because everybody there wears their vyshyvanka in the office, at school, everywhere,"" she said. She said the war meant many people fled Ukraine when Russia invaded and would not have been thinking about vyshyvankas, but that it was important to celebrate the day. ""We feel very proud of who we are and we want to show the world how beautiful we are and how proud we are and that in spite of the fear we believe in our victory."" She has invited people from different countries to gather outside King's College in Cambridge from 16:30 BST on Thursday - wearing vyshyvanka. She said people do not need to be from Ukraine to join in, adding: ""If you are helping, you are Ukrainian - not in your passport but in your state of your mind. In your heart, you are Ukrainian."" Ms Korniiuk was granted a visa under the Ukraine Sponsorship Scheme. She and Ms Platings have been friends for three years after meeting in a restaurant.

The small group of children arrived in Glasgow on Monday and were whisked to join their orphanage families who are being cared for in Edinburgh. The children had stayed behind in the war-torn country while others were evacuated following the Russian invasion in February. They remained to complete medical recuperation in the city of Odesa. However, like the operation to evacuate the original group, the journey to get them to the UK was long, frustrating and hampered by red tape. Dnipro Kids charity spokesman, Steven Carr, told BBC Scotland that in the end, the children's orphanage mothers - their official guardians - had to leave Edinburgh and travel back to Poland and across the Ukraine border to bring the children out of the country. Mr Carr said three youngsters from one orphanage and one from another in Dnipro had been receiving medical care in Odesa, in the south-west of Ukraine. ""A decision was made for the children to stay there until the end of their recovery. Then the children were transferred back to Dnipro while they organised visas etc to get to the UK,"" he said. ""The biggest problem was leaving Ukraine because their legal guardians were not with them. They were already in Scotland."" The charity spent a long time pulling new paperwork together, but after having documents signed by the Ukrainian consulate in Edinburgh the children were turned away at the border because their legal guardians were not there in person. Mr Carr said: ""We thought we had everything in place but had to send them back to Lviv. It ended up our only option was to get two of the orphanage mums back to Poland, then a bus back into Ukraine to bring the children over the border."" The delay cost them weeks, with Lviv subject to missile attacks by the Russians. The group of 52 children and their guardians made headlines when the Dnipro Kids charity fought red tape to bring them to safety in Scotland. After a month in Callander, near Stirling, they moved to Edinburgh where they have started school and settled into their new, temporary lives. The new children will shortly be enrolled in school with their orphanage brothers and sisters. The Dnipro refugees have settled well, but frustration remains over government bureaucracy. The charity has been waiting for two months to receive biometric residence permits for about half of the Ukrainians it brought to Scotland. Mr Carr said: ""We have received little contact from the Home Office. For two months they have been waiting for these residence permits. ""They need these to be able to open a bank account and apply for benefits or assistance with housing - all the things we are entitled to as residents."" When asked about the issue with the permits, a UK government spokeswoman said: ""We're delighted that the children have safely arrived in the UK and we are making sure they have everything they need to welcome them during their stay.""

They are staying with their host Serena Last in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, and are in the same class as her five-year-old daughter Quinn. Dalia said ""nobody knows"" how long they will be the UK for. She said ""every morning I wake up and check the news"" in the hope the war would be ending. Her husband is being trained in the Black Sea city of Odessa to fight on the front line against Russia, and Dalia said she messaged him every day.

Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said the war had worsened food insecurity in poorer nations due to rising prices. Some countries could face long-term famines if Ukraine's exports are not restored to pre-war levels, he added. The conflict has cut off supplies from Ukraine's ports, which once exported vast amounts of cooking oil as well as cereals such as maize and wheat. This has reduced the global supply and caused the price of alternatives to soar. Global food prices are almost 30% higher than the same time last year, according to the UN. Speaking in New York on Wednesday, Mr Guterres said the conflict - combined with the effects of climate change and the pandemic - ""threatens to tip tens of millions of people over the edge into food insecurity followed by malnutrition, mass hunger and famine"". ""There is enough food in our world now if we act together. But unless we solve this problem today, we face the spectre of global food shortage in the coming months,"" he added. He warned that the only effective solution to the crisis was reintegrating Ukraine's food production, as well as fertiliser produced by both Russia and Belarus, back into the global market. Mr Guterres also said he was in ""intense contact"" with Russia and Ukraine, as well as the US and the EU, in an effort to restore food exports to normal levels. ""The complex security, economic and financial implications require goodwill on all sides,"" he said. His comments came on the same day the World Bank announced extra funding worth $12bn (£9.7bn) for projects addressing food insecurity. The move will bring the total amount available for such projects to more than $30bn over the next 15 months. Russia and Ukraine produce 30% of the world's wheat supply and - prior to the war - Ukraine was seen as the world's bread basket, exporting 4.5 million tonnes of agricultural produce per month through its ports. But since Russia launched its invasion in February, exports have collapsed and prices have skyrocketed. They climbed even further after India banned wheat exports on Saturday. The UN says around 20 million tonnes of grain are currently stuck in Ukraine from the previous harvest which, if released, could ease pressure on global markets. While the number of people facing food insecurity had been growing even before the invasion, German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock, accused Moscow of making a difficult situation even worse on Wednesday. ""Russia has launched a grain war, stoking a global food crisis,"" Berlin's top diplomat said. ""It is doing so at a time when millions are already being threatened by hunger, particularly in the Middle East and Africa."" Meanwhile, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the world faced the ""greatest global food security crisis of our time"" which had been exacerbated by what he called Russian President Vladimir Putin's ""war of choice"".

The prisoner was brought into the tiny Kyiv courtroom in handcuffs, flanked by heavily armed guards. He looked nervous, and kept his head bowed. The widow of the man killed was sitting just a couple of metres from him. She wiped tears from her eyes as the soldier entered court, then sat with hands clasped as the prosecutor set out his case, describing the moment Kateryna's husband, Oleksandr Shelipov, was shot in the head. ""Do you accept your guilt?"" the judge asked. ""Yes,"" Shishimarin replied. ""Totally?"" ""Yes,"" he replied quietly from behind the glass of his grey metal-and-glass cage. Prosecutors say Shishimarin was commanding a unit in a tank division when his convoy came under attack. He and four other soldiers stole a car, and as they travelled near Chupakhivka, they encountered the 62-year-old on a bicycle, they said. According to prosecutors, Shishimarin was ordered to kill the civilian and used a Kalashnikov assault rifle to do so. The Kremlin said earlier it was not informed about the case. Shishimarin's trial was adjourned shortly after the civilian's widow heard for the first time the Russian soldier admit to the murder. This high profile hearing will restart on Thursday in a larger courtroom. Oleksandr's widow told the BBC how she was coping, before she left the court for the day. ""I feel very sorry for him [Shishimarin],"" she said. ""But for a crime like that - I can't forgive him."" Ukraine has so far identified more than 10,000 possible war crimes committed by Russia. The country's chief prosecutor Iryna Venediktova tweeted: ""By this first trial, we are sending a clear signal that every perpetrator, every person who ordered or assisted in the commission of crimes in Ukraine shall not avoid responsibility,"" Moscow has denied its troops have targeted civilians, but investigators have been collecting evidence of possible war crimes to bring before the International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague. The ICC is sending a team of 42 investigators, forensics experts and support staff to Ukraine. Meanwhile, Ukraine has also set up a team to preserve evidence to enable future prosecutions.

Russia supplies 40% of the EU's natural gas and 27% of its imported oil. The EU sends the country roughly €400 billion a year in return. Now the EU plans to speed up its shift to green energy but says it must also invest in pipelines in other countries. It has been accused of helping fund the war in Ukraine through its use of Russian energy. The REPowerEU strategy was first announced in March with the stated aim of reducing Russian gas imports by two thirds in 2022. Rising energy costs have also put financial pressure on consumers and businesses in Europe now facing higher bills. The updated proposals outline not just how the EU plans to negotiate both the immediate gas crisis, but also deliver on promises to completely wean itself off Russian energy by 2030. The strategy focuses on three key topic areas. Improving energy efficiency, expanding the use of renewable energy and securing non-Russian suppliers of oil and gas. ""We are taking our ambition to yet another level,"" European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said as she presented the update at a briefing in Brussels, Belgium. The REPowerEU plan is estimated to cost €210 billion (£178 billion) over the next five years. The Commission report highlights energy saving as the ""cheapest, safest and cleanest"" way to reduce dependence on Russian fuel. It wants to improve how buildings of insulated, as well as encourage consumers to be more aware of energy use. It also plans to speed up the transition from fossil fuel burning boilers to electric heat pumps (a device that absorbs heat from the air, ground or water around a building) Plans to reduce energy consumption in the EU have also made more ambitious, from the original plan of a 9% cut to 13% cut by 2030. The bloc has earmarked €113 billion for a ""massive scale up in renewables"" and new hydrogen infrastructure. New EU legislation is being proposed to make it easier to build solar and wind farms. ""Whenever we talk about rapid deployment of renewables, there is an elephant in the room- getting a permit,"" said Frans Timmermans, vice president of the European Commission. ""It might take as long as nine years for wind and up to four years for solar projects, so this is time that we do not have and we have to speed things up,"" he added. The Commission has proposed specially designated ""go-to"" areas where permission can be given in just one year. Certain new buildings could also be required to have solar panels installed on the roof. The EU target for renewable energy has also been more raised. The goal is for green energy to provide 45% of energy needs by 2030, up from 40%. Even if they are fast-tracked in special zones, new wind and solar plants will still take time. To quickly diversify from Russian fossil fuels, the EU is investing up to €12 billion in pipelines and Liquified Natural Gas (LNG) terminals to improve access to gas and oil from other countries including Egypt, Israel and Nigeria. Some environmental groups have criticised the news. Instead they want to see a decisive break with fossil fuels. ""The European Commission's latest strategy gives with one hand and takes with the other,"" said Eilidh Robb, an anti-fossil fuels campaigner at Friends of the Earth. ""So-called REPowerEU contains useful and necessary strides towards renewable solutions but it simultaneously enables almost 50 fossil fuel infrastructure projects and expansions,"" she added. "

Dogbus Rescue, based in Coventry, provides safe transport for animals in need across the UK and Europe. The organisation is asking for supplies such as wooden pallets, pet food and animal medicines to take to Ukraine. Kris Adams, the founder of Dogbus Rescue, said ""Animals don't have a voice and are severely suffering from the war."" She added: ""They don't have a choice to get out of their cages or feed themselves."" The charity is working with other organisations such as War Paws and Breaking the Chain to rescue the animals in Ukraine. Dogbus Rescue said more than 1,000 animals had already been rescued and placed in shelters. It is still receiving donations, but has recently been gathering ""one donation every other day"" as the war continues. Kris Adams said some people were giving ""their last pound away"" to the charity due to the cost of living crisis. ""We had a first aid kit from the 1960s donated to us when someone went through their cupboards,"" said Ms Adams. Coventry Lord Mayor, Councillor John McNicholas, said: ""This appeal is one more way that we can offer our help and I know the people of Coventry will once again show their generosity.""

The evacuation marks the likely end of the battle for the southern Ukrainian port city of Mariupol, which lies in ruins after weeks of relentless Russian bombardment. What happens next to the evacuated Azovstal fighters is unclear, with Ukraine calling for a prisoner swap but some in Russia suggesting they should be put on trial. ""Ukraine needs Ukrainian heroes alive,"" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said in his nightly address after the evacuation of the steelworks began, adding that ""work continues to bring our lads home"". But when and if that will happen is uncertain and details of the agreement brokered between the two sides, as well as the UN and the Red Cross, are unknown. Ukraine says negotiations are ongoing to exchange the fighters for Russian prisoners of war, but Russia has not confirmed that a swap will take place. Russian President Vladimir Putin said the soldiers would be treated ""in line with the relevant international laws"", but there is concern over what will happen to them if they remain in Russian custody. Ukrainian MP Lesia Vasylenko told the BBC that if they are not returned to Ukraine, ""the fate of these very brave men will be absolutely unknown and will be in Russian hands, which is far from an ideal situation"". The signals coming from Russia are concerning for Ukraine. ""Nazi criminals should not be exchanged,"" the speaker of Russia's lower house of parliament, Vyacheslav Volodin, said on Tuesday. ""We should do everything to ensure they are put on trial."" Another senior politician, Leonid Slutsky, went further, calling the evacuated combatants ""animals in human form"" and saying they should be executed. And the Donetsk separatist leader, Denis Pushilin, suggested that Ukrainians who are found to be ""neo-Nazi war criminals"" should face an international tribunal. But Ukrainian Deputy Defence Minister Hanna Maliar told the BBC that such statements ""were most likely made for domestic propaganda in Russia"". Russia claims, without any evidence, that Ukraine is a Nazi hotbed, and one of the key aims of Russia's military operation in Ukraine is to ""denazify"" the country. The Azov regiment, whose members are amongst those evacuated from Azovstal, is the most frequent target for Russia's claim that it is fighting against Nazis in Ukraine. The regiment, which was set up as a volunteer militia in 2014 but is now a National Guard unit, once had links to the far right. Ultimately, it is likely to be Vladimir Putin who makes the final decision over what happens to the Azovstal fighters. I think there was a sharp intake of breath right across this country when the news was announced that some of the last soldiers bunkered in the Azovstal steelworks were not just leaving, but leaving to territory occupied by Russia. It was an impossible choice - if they stayed in the steelworks they would face certain death, but what they face now is, at best, a very, very uncertain fate. President Zelensky for weeks and weeks had been telling the fighters ""please give up if you feel you must, please don't feel you must give your lives in this fight"". Again and again the fighters of the Azov battalion said ""no, we must continue to fight"". Last night President Zelensky said this mission to evacuate the remaining soldiers - and to take care of the ones who have already left - involved, in his words, the most influential international mediators. Because the only thing which has reassured many here, and most of all the families of the fighters, is that there is international involvement, that behind the scenes there is the Red Cross and the United Nations, and they are hoping against hope this can help to persuade Russia. Mariupol is a strategic prize for the Russians but members of the Azov battalion, a group which has origins in the far right, are a prize for President Putin, who it is feared may parade them to say ""see, I told you there were Nazis in Ukraine"".

The group from Kyiv had to wait a month in Ireland while their visas were processed. Finally arriving in Reading on Tuesday evening, they were welcomed by their host families from Tilehurst at the town's Ukrainian community centre. They were greeted with food and drink, and given toiletries, toys and school supplies. The father of one of the women was allowed to travel to the UK with the group after he suffered a heart attack. Another women, Galina, who arrived with her son said: ""If I didn't have a child maybe I would have stayed in Ukraine, but that's why we made the right decision to come to England.

Sylvain Distin, who played for Bournemouth and Portsmouth, will lead a team of nine cyclists 807 miles (1,300km) from Sandbanks in Dorset to St Tropez in the south of France.

She'd been calm and composed until now. She too spent more than two months in one of the bunkers under the vast industrial facility with her two sons where the bombardment felt like it would never end. ""The missiles were so heavy it felt like the bunker walls were moving and the rooms themselves became smaller,"" she told me. ""Sometimes there was a one-hour break and we hoped maybe that's it. Maybe that's the end of it. But no. They carried on."" Behind us, her two boys, aged 6 and 11, were playing with guns made from paper and duct tape. ""They are adapting to being outside again,"" said Katerina. ""Seeing them running around in the sun again is the best feeling in the world."" She remembers all three of them being ""blinded by light"" as they finally emerged after two months in their dark refuge under the steel plant. As the two boys duck and dive behind the trees in the park, they pretend they're fighting Russians. At one point they drop to the ground and shout 'cover your ears'. One gives the shout of 'all clear' and they stand up and get going again. It's haunting to watch. Even the games with the guns feel realistic as they practice putting in a fresh magazine of bullets. They have obviously seen this up close. Katerina believes their father is still at the plant. She heard from him earlier this week and he was his usual upbeat self. ""He is a very strong man, strong in spirit. He has been supporting me all my life."" It was love at first sight, she told me with a smile. Their hometown of Mariupol has now been hollowed out by Russian bombs. Katerina first took her two boys to the Azovstal steel plant in early March, just after the first strikes on the port city. She thought they would use it as a shelter for maybe one or two days - a week at most. But as the bombing intensified, they had to stay below ground for more than 60 days. Supplies dwindled. Food and water became scarce - along with information. As Russian forces encircled the city, she and around 30 others in their bunker were cut off. Occasionally she would get a visit from her husband as he and around 1,000 other Ukrainian fighters continued to defend the steel plant - their last holdout. ""Whenever he visited us there, he would always tell us to hang in there, boosting everyone's morale, joking, laughing, cheering, telling us that we should not worry and that everything is fine. ""It was frightening because they were coming and leaving under shelling. It was weird to see them that cheerful, but I don't think there was any other way. In terms of morale and spirit, I think he is one of the strongest there."" Katerina was finally brought above ground during an operation to free civilians organised by the Red Cross and the United Nations. I first met her at the evacuation centre in Zaporizhzhia. When she stepped off the bus she had everything she owned stuffed in a rucksack on her back. ""There were several times when we were losing hope that we would ever get out,"" she told me back then. Now, two weeks on, she is trying to plan a future for her family. Her home has been destroyed, she has spent two months in a cold and fetid bunker beneath a steel plant and now she is watching and waiting for news for her husband. And yet she remains upbeat - resilient. ""I am confident that it will be fine for us. I'm confident that Ukraine is going to win and stay and independent state."" "

236,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-61480024,2022-05-18T05:04:20,Ukraine war: Refugees say they receive worrying messages," When Alina started checking Beth's Instagram, there was far more at stake than seeing what she was wearing, or which restaurants she'd visited. For the student fleeing Odesa in Ukraine it presented vital information on whether she could trust a stranger. After registering with websites linking Ukrainians with UK hosts, the 21-year-old noticed ""a lot of people"" looking to ""take advantage of refugees"". More than 87,000 people from Ukraine have applied to the sponsorship scheme. It requires the support of a host in the UK. Along with plenty of presumably genuine messages from well-meaning families, Alina, a linguistics student, also began to receive ""worrying"" messages sent directly to her email and WhatsApp. ""I was faced with a lot of people who wanted to take advantage of me,"" explained Alina, who woke to the sound of bombing near her university halls on the first day of the Russian invasion. ""I got a couple of messages that made me feel not very comfortable and I got a couple of messages saying 'we can hire you as a babysitter or to walk the dogs'. It made me really suspicious. ""I'm a refugee, I need a safe place to stay - I'm not looking for money or for a job."" Hundreds of miles away in Cardiff, prospective host Beth was having similar concerns. The 33-year-old hoped the spare room in her flat in the Welsh capital could offer safety to someone who needed it, but worried that refugees and hosts were expected to help match themselves under the UK government scheme. ""I didn't feel comfortable choosing someone to live with me through Facebook,"" she explained. ""It felt like a meat market. There were loads of other families advertising themselves. It was like open season for traffickers, I wanted to keep myself and whoever I was hosting safe. ""I heard there were a lot of people, girls, who were being offered room with basically sex as payment. ""It meant that when I was offering a room it felt like it was on me to prove I would provide a safe space."" When Beth, a biomedical scientist and Brownie leader, matched with Alina, she immediately sent her a link to her Instagram. She said it was one of the easiest ways she could think of to help Alina trust her. Beth's first message also included her Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) check from Brownies - and explicit confirmation that she was offering the room ""for free"". In other words, nothing would be expected of Alina. ""It was a huge letter through WhatsApp,"" remembers Alina. ""The thing that I liked was that she described all her safety checks. Her letter made me feel really comfortable. She was a real person. I thought, 'I feel safe with this girl'."" Home Office data suggests more than 46,000 Ukrainian refugees have already travelled to the UK under family and sponsorship schemes. There have been more than 45,000 applications for visas under the Ukraine Family Scheme and almost 90,000 applications for visas under the sponsorship scheme which Alina travelled on. The Ukraine Sponsorship Scheme allows Ukrainians and their family members to come to the UK if they can find a named host who will be providing accommodation for them. Data from the Office for National Statistics has suggested only 2% of the UK's Ukrainian refugees are living in Wales, despite an offer from the Welsh government to act as a host itself - and supply up to 1,000 people with accommodation. Figures suggest there are more than 1,100 Ukrainian refugees staying in Wales, but just 184 of them have come under Welsh government sponsorship. A Welsh government spokesman said UK-wide delays processing visas had meant a ""significant lag"" in the recorded data. After spending some time Googling each other, messages between Alina and Beth ""started flying"". ""I was very insistent on her mum being there for the first video call,"" said Beth. ""I knew that my mum would be absolutely terrified if things were the other way around - so I wanted to provide that reassurance. ""I was showing views out my window, this is Cardiff, this is where I live, this is somewhere safe."" Alina's mum also travelled to the UK, but her host family are in Yorkshire. When their flight arrived at Heathrow Airport earlier this month, it was Beth who went to pick them up, complete with a selection of biscuits and crisps in case they were hungry. ""I was so nervous, but when we met Beth she was so nice, she was worrying about us and all my anxiety just went,"" said Alina, who still thinks more should be done to help refugees know potential hosts are ""safe"". ""The main thing is to choose your host carefully and to listen to your heart and your brain,"" she said. ""I need to build a new life, my previous life was stolen. I still have hopes I will be able to come back to Ukraine. ""But life is still going on and I have a lot of plans, I want to finish university and then I want to find work - and meet new people and just live."" Beth meanwhile - who used episodes of BBC comedy Gavin and Stacey to help Alina settle into Welsh life during her first night - has promised that she can stay rent-free for a year. ""If she wants to stay on after a year, I'm fully supportive but we'd have to have the rent conversation, I can't see me charging her too much though,"" she smiled. ""If she wants to move out before or after a year, I'm fully behind that too. She'll have my support no matter what."" A UK government spokesman said: ""The Homes for Ukraine scheme has stringent safeguarding measures in place, and the Home Office conducts security and background checks on all sponsors before visas are issued. Councils also conduct checks and must make at least one in-person visit to a sponsor's property. ""We have published a list of recognised providers and new guidance for voluntary and community sector organisations interested in developing a matching service to help more people from Ukraine find safe and sustainable matches with sponsors in the UK.""

Medic David Anderson, from Rutland, said the tank still had its gun pointing directly at the hospital in Trostianets. Mr Anderson is a volunteer with front line aid charity UK-Med. The charity has received £600,000 of government funding to provide support in Ukraine. Mr Anderson, 53, said: ""I find it unbelievable and depressing that a hospital would be deliberately attacked. ""The tank is being guarded as evidence of a war crime and I could not believe what I was seeing. ""It had been blown up in the end and its gun turret is still pointing at the hospital it was attacking."" Mr Anderson, a humanitarian health advisor with the charity - who has been in Ukraine since 14 March - said he was shown around the wards of the hospital. ""There was just devastation everywhere where the tank shells had hit. It's rendered a 170-bed hospital completely inoperable,"" he said. The charity has received funding from the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) to help train Ukrainian doctors, nurses and paramedics on how to deal with mass casualties. It has also set up mobile health clinics that are supporting the most vulnerable civilians remaining in Ukraine, including the elderly and young children. The UK is donating a further £300,000 worth of medicine and pharmaceutical supplies. Mr Anderson has previously worked on humanitarian missions in countries including South Sudan and Myanmar. He said: ""I've been in a couple of war zones before - but not on this scale. ""We walked into one hospital, and they said there were 200 people, but it felt like more. ""There were people with traumatic amputations, flesh burns, blast injuries, just horrific injuries. It's the volume that is genuinely astounding."" The government said there had been more than 130 attacks on healthcare facilities since the Russian invasion began. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said: ""The Kremlin continues to lie about deliberate attacks on Ukraine's hospitals and the indiscriminate targeting of civilians.

238,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-61480988,2022-05-17T22:59:12,Mariupol: The 80 days that left a flourishing city in ruins," After almost three months of relentless assault, Mariupol has fallen. Ukraine's military says its combat mission in the besieged port is over. More than any other Ukrainian city, Mariupol has come to symbolise the ferocious brutality of Russia's assault and the stubbornness of Ukraine's resistance. On Wednesday 23 February, Ivan Stanislavsky left his camera bag at the office. He was on his way to see the layout of his new book on Mariupol's Soviet-era murals at a colleague's house, and didn't want to lug the gear around. He could always pick it up the next day. But on Thursday, as he stood in the street outside his locked and deserted office, he could hear thunderous sounds rolling in from the east. The city was under fire. As the conflict intensified, and gunfire became audible to the west too, Ivan moved his mattress into the hall. He piled up his large collection of art books - including the Encyclopaedia of Ukrainian Rock Music - against the windows of his flat in the district of Primorsky. ""Let's say it was not a waste of a library,"" says the 36-year-old photographer, who is also a press officer at Ukrainian premier league football club FC Mariupol. Across town in the neighbourhood of Kalmiusky, businessman Yevhen was also taking precautions. The 47-year-old had told his family to pack so they could escape the city. But when he returned from the office, he found no packing had been done. His family refused to leave. In an apartment in the same block, metallurgists from the nearby steelworks, Nataliia, 43, and Andrii, 41, were already slicing the last two loaves they had been able to buy, leaving them to dry out so they could eat them piece by piece over the weeks ahead. Volodymyr, a 52-year-old paramedic in Kalmiusky, was also in his kitchen, trying to absorb the news. When reports came in of Russians marching through the village of Chonhar - on a strategic road out of Crimea to the west - he choked. This was a coordinated attack, he realised. The ambulance dispatcher was on the phone. She instructed Volodymyr to ignore routine calls. ""Find the wounded"", he was told. Twenty-two-year-old engineering graduate Mariia thought the first explosion she heard was simply a storm. Then she heard a second. ""We didn't know what to do,"" says Mariia, who like Ivan, lived in Primorsky. ""I didn't have time to think about my future, my plans. I had to think about what I'd eat and drink... [And] what to do with the cats."" It suddenly dawned on her why, in the past few days, soldiers had appeared in the paint shop where she worked, asking to buy blue and yellow tape. They needed it to mark their uniforms. Four days into the war, with the fighting closing in, Ivan and his wife sought shelter in a basement underneath his local supermarket. It offered good protection, and Ivan found that the muffling of sound dulled his sense of mounting anxiety. Daily life was being stripped down to bare essentials. ""We lived like primitive people,"" he told the BBC from Lviv, where he has now fled. ""We broke trees, made fires, cooked food on fires. I even heard of people eating pigeons."" He watched as order gradually broke down all around him. He kept a vivid diary, later published online. ""The Stone Age has arrived,"" he says in his 6 March entry. He writes of watching his fellow Ukrainian citizens raiding abandoned shops, making off with everything from computers and freezers to swimsuits and underwear. One evening a drunk woman interrupts a session of evening gossip in the basement. ""Treat yourself,"" she says, as a flashlight revealed a bottle of Californian Merlot, taken from Wines of the World on nearby Italiiska Street. But aware that even medical supplies and cash tills were being taken, Ivan says he felt disgust. ""We are our own worst enemies,"" he writes. But is this, he wonders, how the fittest survive? After a while, each day became a ""combat mission"". Over a few short weeks, Mariupol fell apart. The Russian military laid siege to the city, attacking power and water supplies. A Russian airstrike hit the maternity hospital on 9 March, and a plane bombed its theatre - clearly marked as a civilian shelter - a week later. Ivan was stunned at how quickly it all happened. ""The whole city, all its infrastructure, supply system, logistics, energy supply were destroyed in a matter of days,"" he says. Sitting underground at night, he sensed people becoming passive. ""You can only wait in the shelter,"" he writes in his diary. ""Some are waiting for spring, some - for the morning to come, some - for the end of the war. And someone is waiting for the bomb to come and kill everyone."" And all this just as Mariupol had seemed destined to turn a corner. Money began to pour in, adding lustre to a city previously associated mainly with heavy industry - and war. ""It was a city aspiring to something,"" Ivan says. It hadn't always been this way. Long before this year's invasion, Mariupol had a ringside seat to Ukraine's simmering conflict with Russian-backed separatists in Donetsk and Luhansk, the two regions that make up the neighbouring area known as Donbas. When fighting first broke out there in 2014, the government briefly lost control of Mariupol after clashes with pro-Russian protesters. In January 2015, a devastating rocket attack by the rebels on the eastern edge of the city killed almost 30 civilians. Even though the war gradually receded, the sound of artillery booming in the distance was part of Mariupol's daily soundscape. But the city moved on. The Ukrainian government briefly made Mariupol the administrative capital of the Donetsk Oblast. People migrated from rebel-held areas and the city started attracting investment. ""It started receiving all of the resources and all of the attention,"" Ivan says. Public buildings were renovated, cafés opened, and new parks created. In a podcast last October, the city's mayor Vadym Boychenko boasted of creating the best municipal services in the country, opening an IT school, and promoting contemporary art and sports. Plans were afoot, he said, for the largest water park in Ukraine and a version of Disneyland ""which will probably be called Mariland"". In fact, Mariupol was declared Ukraine's ""Big Capital of Culture"" in 2021. But while Mariupol flourished, rebel-held Donetsk mouldered. When the rebels returned to Mariupol, Volodymyr, the paramedic, believed they were driven by revenge to destroy the city. ""'If we live in shit, then you will live in shit as well,'"" Volodymyr says they told him at a checkpoint as he finally escaped the city. ""They just looked at us and envied how we lived."" Yevhen, the businessman, describes life in Mariupol in the past five years as ""a fairytale"". ""The city was being reconstructed,"" he says, ""all roads were renovated, public transport was improved."" His buildings restoration firm was responsible, among other projects, for the reconstruction of Mariupol's iconic water tower in time for the city's 240th birthday. ""This is a city of hard workers… It was hard for me to explain that my workers should finish at 6pm - they wanted to work longer."" Like many others, weekends would be spent with family in the city's revived parks or on the seafront. ""For me, this is a [key] question - if you want to capture the city, why destroy it? [The Russians] don't need thinking people, they need territory,"" he says. And, he adds, he is now getting calls from the Russians to return to Mariupol to help rebuild it. ""But if Mariupol is occupied by Russia, there will be no future there… there will be nothing to live for. To live in unrecognised territory is to bury your children's future."" About 150,000 people remain in the city, from a population of almost half a million. Most of those left there, he says, are also trying to escape. ""I left Mariupol but my soul is there,"" he says, tears in his eyes. Nataliia and her husband Andrii worked at the Illich plant, one of two iron and steel works which tower over the city's skyline and loom large in Ivan Stanilavsky's photographs. They spent long days at work, and leisure time was precious. ""The city authorities laid out marble tiles, made piers [so that] it was possible to sit on a bench right in the sea,"" Andrii says. ""It was a wonderful warm city with parks, concerts, fountains,"" his wife says. ""A European city."" This recent blossoming was captured by Ivan, but as a photographer with a passion for his city's past, his pet project was documenting Mariupol's remarkable collection of Soviet murals, one of the most extensive in Ukraine. The cultural importance of preserving such remarkable works seems undeniable, but in Mariupol nostalgia for the Soviet Union jostled uneasily with Ukraine's modern, increasingly European identity, Ivan says. ""Politics was already preventing this cultural heritage from being integrated into Ukraine's artistic context,"" he says. So inevitably, when the war came, culture found itself fought over too. On 28 April, Mariupol's city council denounced the alleged theft by Russia of more than 2,000 exhibits from the city's museums, including ancient icons, a handwritten Torah scroll and more than 200 medals. The director of Mariupol's Local History Museum, Natalia Kapustnikova, later told Russian newspaper Izvestia that she had personally handed over paintings to the Russians by Ivan Aivazovsky and Arkhip Kuindzhi, and claimed that Ukrainian ""nationalists"" had burned 95% of the museum's exhibits. She wasn't the only local official harbouring pro-Russian sentiments. On 9 April, Ukraine's prosecutor general charged a member of Mariupol's city council, Kostyantyn Ivashchenko, with treason after he was declared mayor by pro-Russian separatists in Donetsk. Ivashchenko's pro-Russian party had been well supported in the city's last elections, coming second, while President Volodymyr Zelensky's party came a distant fifth place. In a poll conducted just before the elections by the Kyiv-based Centre for Social Indicators, almost half the city's population identified themselves as ""Russian"", though 80% also described themselves as ""Ukrainian"". More tellingly, perhaps, fewer than 20% self-identified as ""European"", while more than 50% said they were ""Soviet"". Nataliia, whose father is Russian, says she asked her husband for forgiveness when the bombing started. ""I was ashamed that I was Russian."" Mariia, the engineer, says that before the war her first language was Russian, but when the bombing began ""I started to hate all things Russian - language, movies, objects"". Mariupol's complex identity is hardly unique in today's Ukraine, a country which formed an integral part of the Soviet Union until the collapse of communism at the end of the 1980s. And it's doubtful that any of those who described themselves as ""Russian"" or ""Soviet"" wanted to see their city destroyed in a violent effort to pull it back into Moscow's orbit. Ironically, when the moment arrived to defend the city from Russian invaders, it was another part of Mariupol's Soviet-era legacy that came to play an almost iconic role. This legacy, buried deep underground, is the maze of bunkers beneath Mariupol's other steel works, Azovstal, built by the Soviet authorities during the Cold War. The 36 bomb shelters provided room for more than 12,000 people. After independence in 1991, no-one thought that much about them. But then the fighting in 2014 began. ""We started thinking about what we would do if fighting spread further into the city,"" Enver Tskitishvili, Azovstal's director general, says. Training on the use of the bunkers and their connecting tunnels went on every day for years. In early February, as the fear of renewed conflict loomed larger, preparations swung into high gear. Food and water were brought in the week before Russia's invasion. Officials at the plant knew the bomb shelters would soon be occupied, but had little idea that Azovstal, surrounded by water on three sides, would become the scene of Mariupol's last stand. As the days went by, the war got closer and closer to Ivan Stanislavsky's apartment. Excursions in search of food, even to the nearby Dzerkalnyy store, just 400m up the road, were increasingly perilous. Sometimes, a Ukrainian mortar team would arrive by truck, fire off a few rounds, and leave before the inevitable Russian reply. There was little communication between civilians and soldiers. One day, a tank from the Azov Regiment arrived near Dzerkalnyy, sending locals running, fearful of an impending battle. The regiment emerged in 2014 as a highly effective volunteer militia with far right and, in some cases, neo-Nazi affiliations, before being folded into Ukraine's National Guard. Vladimir Putin has made extensive use of the Azov's controversial origins, in an effort to bolster his argument that he is trying to ""de-Nazify"" Ukraine. Ukrainian authorities say the regiment's origins are a thing of the past and points out that far-right parties have had very little electoral success. In his diary Ivan describes the members he knows as a motley assortment of Mariupol natives - bikers, lawyers, football hooligans, and an amateur actor - driven not by ideology, but by a fierce hatred of those who were trying to ruin their lives. ""Together they formed a 'Nazi' battalion and intimidated the entire Russian army,"" he writes. Intimidating and effective, but not enough, eventually, to stem the Russian tide. While the city's defenders fought their losing battle, Ivan heard voices in his basement starting to curse President Zelensky for leaving Mariupol to its own devices. For all the praise heaped on the city's defenders, it was clear from the start that Mariupol was not the government's main priority. Faced with Russian threats on a number of fronts, the Zelensky government chose to secure the capital, thwarting what was arguably Vladimir Putin's top priority. Ultimately, that meant letting Russian forces achieve another of their pre-war goals: the establishment of a land corridor between Crimea - annexed by Moscow in 2014 - and the separatists in the Donbas. But for those trapped in the city, fighting or just trying to survive, it was a bitter pill. ""Some say Mariupol was given the status of a hero city,"" Ivan wrote in his diary on 13 March. ""It looks like the award will be posthumous."" By now, Ivan couldn't stand any more. Outside Dzerkalnyy supermarket, he saw corpses neatly stacked under a wall. People who once queued for food were now in ""the queue of the dead"", waiting to be buried. So on 15 March Ivan bundled four family members and his cat into his miraculously unscathed Skoda Fabia and joined a convoy for the tortuous journey north-west to government-held Zaporizhzhia. At an observation point on Markelova St looking towards the port and the beach, Ivan allowed himself a brief moment of reflection. ""In my head I'm saying goodbye to this place,"" he writes in his diary. ""I have a feeling we will never return here."" A day later, Mariia and five relatives also left by car, carrying just personal belongings and the family's dog. As they made their way out of Mariupol, their convoy came under attack and the cars had to accelerate out of danger, headed first to Zaporizhzhia, then to Dnipro. The following day, Nataliia and Andreii left, after a neighbour offered them a space in his car. The couple eventually reached the city of Khmelnytskyi where they have been selling the family's coin collection in order to survive. In that same convoy, Yevhen travelled with his wife and two other relatives. He's now in Dnipro, helping other residents who escaped Mariupol, and trying to reach those who remain. Volodymyr, the paramedic, stayed in Mariupol as long as he could, to look after his elderly mother. But deprived of food and special medicine, she died. He then left the city on 21 April, and is volunteering at a hospital in Dnipro. ""There are thousands and thousands of families like mine,"" he says. ""How many people have died? How many families have been lost?"" Two months after escaping, Ivan is still watching the death throes of Mariupol from the relative safety of Lviv. In his diary's poignant epilogue, he writes of flashbacks, text messages about deaths or lucky escapes, and phone calls that go unanswered. ""The subscriber is out of range.""

More than 260 fighters were on Monday taken to hospitals held by Russian-backed rebels in eastern Ukraine - but a number of soldiers, the city's last defenders, are still trapped in underground bunkers. On Tuesday, Ukraine's Deputy Defence Minister Hanna Maliar said Kyiv was doing ""everything possible and impossible"" to save the remaining fighters with the hope of exchanging them for captured Russian soldiers. However, Russian lawmakers already plan to declare some of the evacuated fighters ""Nazi criminals"" who must not be part of any prisoner swap with Ukraine. On the battlefield, Russian troops continued their offensive in the eastern Donbas region - but Ukraine said Moscow had no success. Read more about the evacuations here. Away from Mariupol, both Ukraine and Russia admitted that peace talks aimed at ending the war that Russian President Vladimir Putin launched on 24 February were currently on hold, blaming each other for this impasse. After more than 80 days of fierce fighting, the strategic port is almost entirely in Russian hands - with only the Azovstal industrial complex still under Ukrainian control. Capturing Mariupol would give Russia a strategic advantage: a land bridge to Crimea and full control of the Sea of Azov, cutting off Ukraine's maritime trade. It would also deliver a propaganda coup for President Putin. But this has come at an enormous cost to the city. From the start of Russia's invasion, Mariupol has been shelled relentlessly, leaving the city almost totally levelled, despite fierce resistance. We've divided it down move-by-move to see how Russian forces secured victory in a military campaign that shocked the world. Read our full piece with photos and maps here Almost 13 million people are believed to have fled their homes in Ukraine since the conflict began, according to the UN. More than six million have left for neighbouring countries and at least another 6.5 million people are thought to be displaced inside the war-torn country itself. So, where are Ukraine's refugees going and what help are they getting abroad? Here's our handy explainer A photo of a heavily pregnant woman fleeing a bombed maternity hospital in Mariupol has become one of the most iconic images of the war. But after surviving the attack, Marianna Vyshemirsky, 29, was then targeted by a Russian disinformation campaign, receiving hate from both sides. A beauty blogger before the war, Ms Vyshemirsky was falsely accused of ""acting"" and using make-up to fake the blood on her face - falsehoods which were repeated and amplified by senior Russian officials and state media. She told the BBC's specialist disinformation reporter, Marianna Spring, what happened next. 'My picture was used to spread lies about the war' Russia's mainstream media outlets offer a view of the Ukraine war that is unlike anything seen from outside of the country. For a start, they don't even call it a war. But on Monday night, viewers witnessed an extraordinary piece of television. The programme was 60 Minutes, the flagship twice-daily talk show on Russian state TV: studio discussion that promotes the Kremlin line on absolutely everything, including on President Putin's so-called ""special military operation"" in Ukraine. The Kremlin still maintains that the Russian offensive is going according to plan. But studio guest Mikhail Khodarenok, a military analyst and retired colonel, painted a very different picture. He warned that ""the situation [for Russia] will clearly get worse"" as Ukraine receives additional military assistance from the West and that ""the Ukrainian army can arm a million people"". Read the full story here, as told by our Russia editor Steve Rosenberg. Hundreds of packets of sweets are to be driven from Somerset, south-west England, to the Ukrainian border, and given to refugees who have fled the war. Paul and Dawn Cotterell, from Wembdon near Bridgwater, said they want to put a smile back on children's faces. The couple, who own a confectionary business, will take a car-load of sweets to the Polish-Ukrainian border. Each package has a handwritten ""With Love"" label, and the name of the person who donated it. ""We decided we wanted to do our little bit."" said Mr Cotterell. ""To bring a smile to the children's faces after what they've been through - even if it's just for a few minutes - that would make all the difference. "
240,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-61179093,2022-05-17T18:25:00,Mariupol: Key moments in the siege of the city," The evacuation of Ukrainian troops from Mariupol's Azovstal steelworks, after two months inside, is the latest setback in Ukraine's efforts to defend the port city. Mariupol, in south-east Ukraine, has been encircled since the start of March and is now mostly under the control of Kremlin forces. Control of Mariupol would give Russia a land bridge to Crimea and full control of the Sea of Azov, cutting off Ukraine's maritime trade. It would also deliver a propaganda coup for Vladimir Putin. However, the process of capturing the city has been slow and bloody. Just days after Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Mariupol, a port city of some 430,000 people, found itself surrounded. From the start of Russia's invasion on 24 February, Mariupol had come under relentless shelling. By 2 March, Russian troops were several kilometres from the city on all sides, deputy mayor Serhiy Orlov told the BBC. After 15 hours of continuous bombardment, Mariupol was already ""near to a humanitarian catastrophe"", he said. Strikes to infrastructure had cut water and power supplies to parts of the city, he added, and there were also food shortages. Satellite photos showed civilian homes and buildings had been destroyed. One densely populated residential district had been ""nearly totally destroyed"", the deputy mayor said. Sieges - an ancient tactic of warfare - were now a consistent feature of this 21st Century conflict. By this point the Russian military had also surrounded the country's second-largest city, Kharkiv, and the city of Kherson. And in the weeks ahead, the invading forces would encircle Mariupol ever closer. It was a sight that shocked the world - a maternity and children's hospital, hit by a Russian air strike. Initial reports said three people - including a child - had been killed. Later, a woman photographed in the wake of the attack on a stretcher died along with her baby. At least 16 others, including both staff and patients, were injured, according to local officials. There was widespread revulsion in the wake of the attack. President Volodymyr Zelensky described it as a war crime: ""What kind of a country is Russia, that it is afraid of hospitals and maternity wards and destroys them?"" he asked. The image of heavily-pregnant Marianna Vyshemirsky, her face smeared with blood, as she stepped over rubble down a flight of stairs was also widely shared. The Russian embassy in the UK tweeted a conspiracy theory that Ms Vyshemirsky was an actress and the aftermath of the attack had been staged. But the BBC's disinformation team found evidence contradicting these unfounded claims and eventually spoke to Ms Vyshemirsky herself, after she had given birth to a daughter. By mid-March, Mariupol's civilian death toll exceeded 2,100, according to the city council. But heavy Russian shelling had stood in the way of any mass evacuation. On 14 March a humanitarian corridor was agreed with Russia and a convoy of at least 160 private cars managed to leave Mariupol. By mid-afternoon on 15 March, 2,000 cars had left. But many more had not yet managed to leave. And so the BBC reported that improvised burial sites were now being dug in the city. The deputy mayor was unable to quantify the number of bodies buried in this way. But he told the BBC there were 67 at one site alone. ""We can't bury [the victims] in private graves, as those are outside the city and the perimeter is controlled by Russian troops,"" Serhiy Orlov said. ""Some we can't identify but some had documents."" With municipal services having collapsed, street cleaners and road repair teams were collecting bodies in the streets, Mr Orlov said, adding: ""We've had no electricity, or heating, sanitation, water, food for 11 days."" Mariupol was not alone. There were reports of mass graves, too, in the town of Bucha, and the city of Chernihiv, both in the north of Ukraine. Later, a US satellite firm said it had identified a mass burial site containing about 200 graves near a village called Manhush, about 20km (12 miles) west of Mariupol. For Ukrainians all this evoked memories of World War Two, when Jews and Soviet partisans were murdered by Nazis, and the Holodomor in the early 1930s, after Stalin forced Ukraine's peasants into collective farms and seized all their grain and livestock. For days the Donetsk Regional Theatre of Drama had been a place of safety for civilians sheltering from Russia's aerial assault. Then came an attack that, according to officials, killed 300 people - thought to be the worst known loss of life in a single strike since the invasion began. The vast Soviet-era building in the middle of a square in the city centre had been clearly marked as a civilian shelter. According to an adviser to the mayor, some 600 people had been inside when it was hit. At the time of the strike, the word ""children"" had been written in giant letters on the ground outside the theatre building in the centre of the city. The BBC spoke to survivors who told of mothers searching for their children under the rubble and a five-year-old child screaming: ""I don't want to die."" Russia denied that it had any role in attacking the theatre. But there was widespread international condemnation of Moscow's actions. Russian Col-Gen Mikhail Mizintsev, who the British government described as the ""Butcher of Mariupol"" for his role in the bombardment of the city, was later sanctioned by the UK. Russia said its forces had entered the centre of Mariupol. Mayor Vadym Boichenko said fighting in the city was ""really active"". Then came the allegation that Russia had been forcibly relocating hundreds of civilians from Mariupol. On March 24, Mariupol authorities updated the figure to 15,000. By 27 March, Russia was housing an estimated 5,000 at a temporary camp in Bezimenne, east of Mariupol, seen in satellite images. In parts of Mariupol now under Russian control, reports suggested that civilians - without access to food, water and medicine - had little choice but to leave for Russian-controlled areas and Russia itself. Some Ukrainian officials described Russia's actions as ""deportations"" to so-called filtration camps. A warring party deporting civilians to its territory is an internationally-recognised abuse of human rights. Over time, accounts emerged of conditions inside these facilities. One couple described how they were driven to a refugee hub that was ""like a true concentration camp"", in which their phones were searched and elderly people slept in corridors without mattresses or blankets. The office of Mayor Boichenko, who had by this point left the city, estimated that nearly 5,000 people had been killed in Mariupol since the start of the siege. It also said 90% of buildings had been damaged and 40% destroyed. The estimated number of people who were thought to still be trapped numbered about 170,000. By late March, weeks of relentless Russian shelling had reduced Mariupol to ruins. But attempts to establish a ceasefire in the city to allow evacuations had collapsed amid accusations of bad faith on both sides of the conflict. Ukraine claimed that Russian troops had carried on shelling the evacuation routes. Russia was then accused by Ukraine of blocking a bus convoy on its way to evacuate Mariupol. Meanwhile, French officials said Vladimir Putin had agreed to consider plans to evacuate civilians from the city during an hour-long phone call with France's President Emmanuel Macron. But the Kremlin said the Russian leader had insisted that shelling of the city would only cease when Ukraine surrendered. Russia's defence ministry said 1,026 soldiers of Ukraine's 36th Marine Brigade, including 162 officers, had surrendered in Mariupol. Two days later, the mayor told the Associated Press that an estimated 120,000 people still remained in the city. As Russian forces overwhelmed Mariupol, the Azovstal Iron and Steel Works - a massive, four sq-mile (10 sq km) plant in the south-east of the city - became its last centre of the Ukrainian resistance. On 18 April the city's council said there were still 1,000 civilians hiding at the site - a mass of tunnels and workshops. As Russian forces advanced slowly into the heart of Mariupol, the sprawling complex also became a home to thousands of Ukrainian soldiers, including fighters from the Azov battalion - a national guard unit with former links to the far-right. A Russian deadline for the surrender of Ukrainian forces in Mariupol passed with no sign that the troops had complied. But then in a televised meeting on 21 April, Vladimir Putin ordered his forces to hold back from storming the complex. Instead, he instructed troops to block off the industrial area, so that ""not even a fly can escape"". Subsequently the Azov regiment posted a video showing women and children purportedly sheltering underground at the plant, saying they were running out of food and water, and pleading to be evacuated. On 2 May, the long-awaited evacuation of civilians from the steel plant got under way. More than 100 evacuees from Mariupol made it to relative safety in Zaporizhzhia, after a journey which took several days. Among them were 69 people who had sheltered in bunkers beneath the massive Azovstal steelworks for month. Three days later it was reported another 300 civilians had been evacuated. In a a remarkable news conference on 5 May, broadcast live from a bunker in the steelworks, a Ukrainian fighter said his country's government had ""failed"" in the defence of Mariupol but insisted surrender was ""unacceptable"". By 7 May it was announced that all remaining women, children and elderly people had left the plant. Fighting continued until 17 May, when it was announced that more than 260 fighters - some of badly wounded - had been evacuated, marking the end of the Ukrainian military operation to defend the site. The soldiers were taken to Russian-controlled territory late on 16 May. It was suggested they could be exchanged for Russian prisoners of war, but this is unconfirmed. People remain trapped in the Azovstal plant and efforts to rescue them are said to be ongoing. Hanna Maliar, Ukraine's deputy defence minister, said Ukraine's military, intelligence, National Guard and Border Service were ""carrying out joint efforts to save"" those left behind. She also hailed the actions of the plant's defenders, who she said had ""fully accomplished all missions assigned by the command"". But she noted that their position had become untenable after it became ""impossible to unblock Azovstal by military means"". In a message posted to Facebook on Monday night, Ukraine's General Staff called the troops ""heroes of our time"" and said their efforts had helped Kyiv organise the defence of its southern flank. "

The programme was 60 Minutes, the flagship twice-daily talk show on Russian state TV: studio discussion that promotes the Kremlin line on absolutely everything, including on President Putin's so-called ""special military operation"" in Ukraine. The Kremlin still maintains that the Russian offensive is going according to plan. But on Monday night, studio guest Mikhail Khodarenok, a military analyst and retired colonel, painted a very different picture. He warned that ""the situation [for Russia] will clearly get worse"" as Ukraine receives additional military assistance from the West and that ""the Ukrainian army can arm a million people"". Referring to Ukrainian soldiers, he noted: ""The desire to defend their motherland very much exists. Ultimate victory on the battlefield is determined by the high morale of troops who are spilling blood for the ideas they are ready to fight for. ""The biggest problem with [Russia's] military and political situation,"" he continued, ""is that we are in total political isolation and the whole world is against us, even if we don't want to admit it. We need to resolve this situation. ""The situation cannot be considered normal when against us, there is a coalition of 42 countries and when our resources, military-political and military-technical, are limited."" The other guests in the studio were silent. Even the host, Olga Skabeyeva, normally fierce and vocal in her defence of the Kremlin, appeared oddly subdued. In many ways, it's a case of ""I told you so"" from Mr Khodarenok. Writing in Russia's Independent Military Review back in February, before Moscow attacked Ukraine, the defence analyst had criticised ""enthusiastic hawks and hasty cuckoos"" for claiming that Russia would easily win a war against Ukraine. His conclusion back then: ""An armed conflict with Ukraine is not in Russia's national interests."" Criticism in print is one thing. But on TV - to an audience of millions - that is another level completely. The Kremlin has gone out of its way to control the informational landscape here: shutting down independent Russian news sources and ensuring that television - the principal tool in Russia for shaping public opinion - is on message. It is rare to hear such realistic analysis of events on Russian TV. Rare. But not unique. In recent weeks, critical views have appeared on television here. In March, on another popular TV talk show, a Russian filmmaker told the presenter: ""The war in Ukraine paints a frightening picture, it has a very oppressive influence on our society."" So what happened on 60 Minutes? Was this a spontaneous, unprompted and unexpected wake-up call on Ukraine that slipped through the net? Or was it a pre-planned burst of reality in order to prepare the Russian public for negative news on the progress of the ""special military operation""? It's difficult to say. But as they say on the telly, stay tuned to Russian TV for further signals. "

243,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-61472025,2022-05-17T11:03:14,Mariupol: Hundreds of besieged Ukrainian soldiers evacuated," Ukraine has confirmed that hundreds of its fighters trapped for more than two months in Mariupol's Azovstal steelworks have been evacuated. Deputy Defence Minister Hanna Maliar said 53 badly wounded soldiers were taken to the town of Novoazovsk, held by Russian-backed rebels. She said another 211 were evacuated using a humanitarian corridor to Olenivka - also a rebel-held town. Russia earlier said a deal had been reached to evacuate the injured troops. About a dozen buses carrying Ukrainian fighters who were holed up beneath the besieged plant were seen leaving the huge industrial site in the southern port city on Monday evening, Reuters news agency reported. Russian state-run media outlets also posted footage of what they say were injured Ukrainian soldiers being evacuated from Azovstal. Ms Maliar said the troops would be exchanged for captured Russian soldiers. In his video address after midnight local time on Tuesday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said that Ukrainian military, intelligence and negotiating teams, as well as the Red Cross and the UN were involved in the evacuation operation. ""Ukraine needs its heroes alive,"" he said. However, he cautioned that the Ukrainian troops may not be freed immediately and warned that negotiations over their release will require ""delicacy and time"". Ukrainian MP Lesia Vasylenko told the BBC it is essential that the deal struck with Russia, with the help of the Red Cross and the UN, goes through and the soldiers are exchanged. Otherwise, she said, ""the fate of these very brave men will be absolutely unknown and will be in Russian hands, which is far far from an ideal situation"". On Tuesday, Russian President Vladimir Putin said Ukrainian soldiers evacuated from the steel plant will be treated ""in line with the relevant international laws"". Hundreds of Ukrainian soldiers - Marines, the National Guard - including the Azov regiment - border guards, police and territorial defence units - as well as a number of civilians with young children have been holed up at the site since advancing Russian troops encircled the southern city in early March. The sprawling four-square mile complex is a maze of tunnels designed to survive a nuclear war. Last month Mr Putin called off a planned assault on the site, citing fears of high Russian casualties. But heavy bombardment continued virtually non-stop, Ukrainian commanders have said. Earlier this month, dozens of civilians were evacuated from Mariupol to both Russia-controlled and Ukraine-controlled territory after weeks under siege. It was not immediately clear how many people still remain in underground bunkers. Ms Maliar, Ukraine's deputy defence minister, said Ukraine's military, intelligence, National Guard and Border Service were ""carrying out joint efforts to save"" those left behind. She also hailed the actions of the plant's defenders, who she said had ""fully accomplished all missions assigned by the command"". But she noted that their position had become untenable after it became ""impossible to unblock Azovstal by military means"". In a message posted to Facebook on Monday night, Ukraine's General Staff called the troops ""heroes of our time"" and said their efforts had helped Kyiv organise the defence of its southern flank. ""Maintaining their positions at Azovstal, they did not allow the opponent to shift the grouping of up to 17 battalion tactical groups (about 20,000 personnel) to other directions. Thereby hindered the implementation of the plan for the rapid capture of Zaporizhzhia,"" military chiefs said in the post. Meanwhile, the Azov regiment, a National Guard unit which once had links to the far right, appeared to confirm that its fighters had agreed in a social media post to lay down their arms. The group's commander, Lt Col Denys Prokopenko said his priority was saving ""as many lives of personnel as possible"". "

Recep Tayyip Erdogan said the two Nordic nations should not bother sending delegations to convince Turkey, a key Nato member, of their bids. He is angered by what he sees as their willingness to host Kurdish militants. Without the support of all Nato members, Sweden and Finland cannot join the military alliance. On Monday, Sweden said Europe was living in a dangerous new reality, referring to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Russian President Vladimir Putin said the move by Finland and Sweden to join the 30-member military alliance did not threaten Moscow directly - but stressed that any expansion of military infrastructure would trigger a response from the Kremlin. At a news conference on Monday, Mr Erdogan said Turkey opposed the Finnish and the Swedish bids to join Nato, describing Sweden as a ""hatchery"" for terrorist organisations. ""Neither of these countries have a clear, open attitude towards terrorist organisation. How can we trust them?"" the Turkish president said. Turkey accuses the two Nordic nations of harbouring members of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), a group it views as a terrorist organisation, and followers of Fethullah Gulen, who Ankara accuses of orchestrating a 2016 coup attempt. All member states must agree that a new country can join Nato, therefore Sweden and Finland require Turkey's support in their bid to join the military alliance. Mr Erdogan said Swedish and Finnish delegations should not bother going to Ankara, Turkey's capital, to convince it to approve their Nato bid. His government has also pledged to block applications from countries that have imposed sanctions on it. In 2019, both Nordic nations slapped an arms embargo on Ankara after its incursion into Syria. Speaking in parliament in Helsinki on Monday, Finnish Foreign Minister Pekka Haavisto said he was surprised by Turkey's stance, but added that his government was not interested in ""bargaining"" with Mr Erdogan. Finland formally announced its bid to join Nato last week. It was joined by neighbour Sweden on Saturday in a move that will end the Scandinavian country's centuries-long military non-alignment. ""Nato will strengthen Sweden, Sweden will strengthen Nato,"" Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson said at a briefing on Monday. She said Europe was now living in a dangerous new reality, referring to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. ""We are leaving one era behind us and entering a new one,"" Ms Andersson told lawmakers during a debate in Stockholm, also on Monday. She said a formal application could be handed in within several days and would be synchronised with Finland. Nato has signalled its willingness to admit the two new members. However, Ms Andersson stressed that Sweden did not want permanent Nato bases or nuclear weapons on its territory. Norway, Denmark and Iceland - all Nato members - immediately said they were ready to support Sweden and Finland by all means necessary if they came under attack. The UK, also a Nato member, has already given security guarantees to Sweden and Finland to cover the transition period. Monday's announcement by Sweden came as Nato began one of its biggest exercises in the Baltic region, involving some 15,000 troops. Named ""Hedgehog"", the drills in Estonia involve 10 countries, including Finland and Sweden. For Finland and Sweden to join Nato, all 30 existing members must say yes. But for now, one is saying no. President Erdogan says he won't agree to admit countries which apply sanctions on Turkey. Sweden suspended arms sales to Turkey three years ago, following Ankara's military intervention in Syria. And according to the official Turkish news agency, both Finland and Sweden have rejected dozens of requests to extradite Kurdish militants who Turkey describes as terrorists. Both countries are sending delegations to Ankara to try and solve the problem, but President Erdogan says they shouldn't bother. He seems determined to extract a price for his precious vote. On Sunday, the US Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, said he was confident that Finland and Sweden would both join, despite Turkish objections. The issue is likely to dominate discussions between Mr Blinken and his Turkish opposite number in Washington on Wednesday. Having encouraged the two Nordic countries to apply, Washington won't want to let them down at the 11th hour. Do you live in Finland or Sweden? What are your thoughts about possible Nato expansion?

The move comes after it temporarily closed its 850 outlets in March. The fast food giant said it made the decision because of the ""humanitarian crisis"" and ""unpredictable operating environment"" caused by the Ukraine war. The opening of McDonald's first restaurant in Moscow in 1990 came to symbolise a thaw in Cold War tensions. A year later, the Soviet Union collapsed and Russia opened up its economy to companies from the West. More than three decades later, however, it is one of a growing number of corporations pulling out. ""This is a complicated issue that's without precedent and with profound consequences,"" said McDonald's chief executive Chris Kempczinski in a message to staff and suppliers. ""Some might argue that providing access to food and continuing to employ tens of thousands of ordinary citizens, is surely the right thing to do,"" he added. ""But it is impossible to ignore the humanitarian crisis caused by the war in Ukraine. And it is impossible to imagine the Golden Arches representing the same hope and promise that led us to enter the Russian market 32 years ago."" McDonald's said it would sell all its sites to a local buyer and would begin the process of ""de-arching"" the restaurants which involves removing its name, branding and menu. It will retain its trademarks in Russia. The chain said its priorities included seeking to ensure its 62,000 employees in Russia continued to be paid until any sale was completed and that they had ""future employment with any potential buyer"". McDonald's said it would write off a charge of up to $1.4bn (£1.1bn) to cover the exit from its investment. It really is the end of an era. I was in the queue when the first Russian McDonald's opened on Moscow's Pushkin Square in January 1990 - way back in the USSR. There were so many people outside the restaurant, it took three hours to get inside. But what a sense of excitement. Those American burgers, fries and pies were a symbol of Moscow embracing the West. Hot food to help end a Cold War. These are very different times. Russia and the West have lost their appetite for one another. Russia's attack on Ukraine has sparked international condemnation and sanctions, turning Moscow into a pariah. Meanwhile, the Kremlin - as it always does - points the finger back, accusing the West of plotting Russia's downfall. Back in March lots of international companies announced they were pausing operations in Russia, hoping the situation would resolve itself and they could then reopen. But McDonald's decision to sell up and pull out shows the fast food giant recognises things will not return to normal and that what the Kremlin calls its ""special military operation"" in Ukraine has changed things long term. Big Macs are only the beginning. I predict we're going to see a lot more global brands leaving Russia. The move comes after Renault announced it was selling its business in the country. The French firm said its 68% stake in carmaker Avtovaz would be sold to a Russian science institute, while its shares in Renault Russia will go to the city of Moscow. Moscow said Renault's Russian assets had now become state property - marking the first nationalisation of a major foreign business since the invasion of Ukraine. Last year, Russia and Ukraine accounted for about 9% of McDonald's global sales. The chain's 108 restaurants in Ukraine remain closed due to the conflict but the company is continuing to pay full salaries to all its employees there. McDonald's initially faced criticism for being slow to halt its business in Russia, with some calling for a boycott of the company before it suspended operations in March. Hundreds of international brands, including Starbucks, Coca Cola, Levi's and Apple, have left Russia or suspended sales there since the country invaded Ukraine in February. Other firms, including Burger King and Marks and Spencer, say they are unable to close stores due to complex franchise deals. "

The members of one family who have just arrived in the East Yorkshire town of Hessle say the language barrier is perhaps the biggest daily struggle as they try to rebuild their lives from scratch in a whole new country. Andrey Dranyi, 43, his wife Ninel, 40, and their 13-year-old daughter Mira were welcomed by their sponsors in Hessle in April after escaping the central Ukraine city of Krivyy Rih - also the home of president Volodymyr Zelensky - as Russian missiles rained down. Andrey says: ""It's very difficult not being able to speak the language. But we are making efforts to learn English."" The BBC, joined by a translator, accompanied the family to shops in Hessle town centre and saw a snapshot of the difficulties and frustrations faced by refugees unable to speak English - as well as random acts of kindness from local people. ""The biggest obstacle that stops us being able to move on is the language,"" admits Ninel, speaking through the translator. ""I need a lot of medication and just explaining my condition to the doctor is difficult. ""We can't understand the names of things in shops. We wanted to buy tomato paste, but we got pure tomatoes. We just see the picture of tomatoes."" The family's sponsors interact with them using a combination of flash cards and Google Translate, but it's during their time out and about in the town that the language barrier proves most problematic. The family calls in to The Crescent, a greengrocers in Prestongate, where owner Mark Wilson welcomes them with a smile but struggles to understand them. Mark says: ""I really feel for them. They've found themselves in an awful situation. They must really be feeling out of their comfort zone and frustrated."" In the past, Mark has used Google Translate and ""facial expressions"" to communicate with non-English speaking customers and, he adds: ""A smile definitely helps."" Once outside again, Kim Jackson, from Villa Natura coffee shop, introduces herself and offers the family hot drinks. She will not accept payment. Neither party understands the other's language, but the offer is made using hand signals - and is sealed with hugs. Kim says: ""It must be so hard for them arriving here and not being able to speak our language. It must have been horrendous what they've been through."" Mira, who will begin studying at secondary school in June, says she is ""longing to be able to communicate"". ""I am doing my best to improve,"" she adds. The language problem is perhaps doubly frustrating because the Dranyis are so keen to tell their story of the war to as wide an audience as possible. Andrey tells us he was working away, assembling cars in Poland, when the Russians attacked. His wife was informed of the invasion by her daughter's head teacher. Ninel says: ""We live on the 12th floor. I looked down and saw people loading up their cars and leaving. Then I heard explosions."" The explosions were missiles striking a nearby military installation, destroying Ukrainian tanks, she says. At first, the family was too scared to flee. Ninel says: ""There was a lot of shooting. It was too dangerous to leave. We sheltered underground in our apartment."" Due to her health condition Ninel needs regular medication, but with medicine and food supplies struggling to get through, she decided to flee with her daughter to Poland, where they were reunited with Andrey. They then made contact, via British volunteers in Poland, with their sponsors in Hessle. Both Andrey and Ninel have elderly parents who remain in Ukraine. Ninel says: ""My mum cannot move very far. She lives on the 12th floor of an apartment block. During air raids, the lifts are switched off. She has nowhere to hide."" Andrey adds: ""We are very upset. It was totally unexpected this aggression. It was against all logic."" The family's sponsors in Hessle, Mark and Liane Kensett, have previously helped refugees fleeing other other war zones, including Afghanistan and Syria. Mark says the language barrier is proving ""stressful"". ""Negotiating online forms and paperwork is challenging. Mira is due to start school in a couple of weeks. The school has a teacher who speaks Russian, but clearly they can't be following Mira and a handful of others around school."" But despite the language difficulties, Mark says the family has received a ""warm welcome"" from people in East Yorkshire. Meanwhile, Peter Oluotch, from the Hull-based Humber Community Advice Services, says the Dranyis are certainly not alone in finding the language barrier a big problem. He says: ""It's really challenging for people arriving in this country, especially when they are not English speakers. It's really important they are given support to learn the language so they can interact with others and integrate. ""Some people have been through some really traumatic experiences. We have seen this in people who have escaped from Afghanistan, Syria and more recently Ukraine,"" he adds. With this in mind, East Riding of Yorkshire Council recently teamed up with Hull City Council to launch a helpline - on 01482 300 305 - with advisors who speak Ukrainian and Russian, as well as English, to assist people arriving in the county through the government's Homes for Ukraine scheme. A council spokeswoman says: ""Guests from Ukraine may also contact the East Riding Council via supportforukraine@eastriding.gov.uk for information to be translated. Much information is already provided in the three different languages."" Meanwhile, Andrey has thanked local residents in Hessle for their hospitality and their welcome. He says all the family will continue to work on their English. ""From day to day we improve a little,"" he adds. Follow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

247,https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-trending-61412773,2022-05-16T23:51:54,Marianna Vyshemirsky: 'My picture was used to spread lies about the war'," A photo of a heavily pregnant woman fleeing a bombed maternity hospital became one of the most iconic images of the war in Ukraine. But its subject was targeted by an extraordinary Russian disinformation campaign and she received hate from both sides. Wrapped in a duvet with her forehead bloodied, Marianna Vyshemirsky's image was seen around the world. The photo above was taken in the aftermath of a Russian airstrike in Mariupol. It circulated online, on newspaper front pages, and was argued about at the UN Security Council. But, having survived one attack, Marianna faced another onslaught - of disinformation and hate aimed at her and her family. As Russia attempted to sow falsehoods about the attack, 29-year-old Marianna was falsely accused of ""acting"". Russian diplomats even claimed that she had ""played"" not one, but two different women. I've spoken extensively to her friends and relatives, but have been trying to interview my namesake for weeks. So when she finally appears on my screen on a video call, it feels a little surreal. She tells me about her harrowing escape, and about the online abuse that came after. ""I received threats that they would come and find me, that I would be killed, that my child would be cut into pieces,"" she says. This is her first interview with a major western media outlet after being evacuated to her hometown in a part of Donbas controlled by Russian-backed separatists. Marianna seems at ease, and is speaking to me without any preconditions, but a pro-separatist blogger is with her. She tells me what it's like to find herself inside an information battle - all while giving birth to her daughter Veronika in a war zone. ""She chose to show up at a difficult time,"" she explains, ""but it's better she arrived under these circumstances than not at all."" Life in Mariupol was very different before the war. Marianna promoted beauty products on social media, while her husband Yuri worked at the Azovstal steel works. ""We had a quiet and simple life,"" she says, ""and then, of course, things were turned upside down."" Her Instagram account shows her excitement at the prospect of becoming a mother. But by the time Marianna was admitted to hospital, Mariupol had become the most bombed city in Ukraine. On 9 March, she was chatting with other women on the ward when an explosion shook the hospital. She pulled a blanket over her head. Then a second explosion hit. ""You could hear everything flying around, shrapnel and stuff,"" she says. ""The sound was ringing in my ears for a very long time."" The women sheltered in the basement with other civilians. Marianna suffered a forehead cut and glass fragments lodged in her skin, but a doctor told her she didn't need stitches. What she did need, she explains, was to retrieve her possessions from the ruins of the hospital. She asked a police officer to help her back inside. ""Everything I had prepared for my baby was in that maternity ward,"" she says. While she stood outside the hospital, waiting to recover her things, she was photographed by journalists from the Associated Press. They snapped her again as she descended the stairs exiting the building. Those images quickly went viral. And that's when false allegations that the pictures were ""staged"" first appeared on a pro-Kremlin Telegram channel. Marianna's beauty blogging was used to suggest she was an ""actor"" who had used makeup to fake injuries. These falsehoods were repeated and amplified by senior Russian officials and state media. They even claimed that a photo of another pregnant woman on a stretcher was also Marianna, even though it's clear that the photos are of different people. The woman on the stretcher and her unborn child later died from their injuries. Fleeing and without internet access, Marianna didn't see those images until days later. By that point, her Instagram was inundated with accusatory and threatening messages. She found both the trolling and the false allegations shocking. ""It was really offensive to hear that, because I actually lived through it all,"" she says. But she refrains from directly criticising the Russian officials who spread the false information about her. Instead, she criticises the Associated Press. ""I was offended that the journalists who had posted my photos on social media had not interviewed other pregnant women who could confirm that this attack had really happened."" She suggests this may help explain why some people ""got the impression that it was all staged"". But by Marianna's own account she was one of the last patients to be evacuated, and that was when the AP journalists arrived. The journalists interviewed other people at the scene. And they had nothing to do with the subsequent false story spread by Russian officials. We approached the AP for comment. In the days after the attack, Marianna gave birth to Veronika in another hospital. Like thousands of others, Marianna and Yuri were desperately trying to escape Mariupol. For weeks, it was largely impossible to make contact with them. Eventually Marianna's relatives told me the couple had got out of the city, but their whereabouts were unclear. Then in early April, they resurfaced in the Donbas region. She filmed an interview with Denis Seleznev, a blogger who is a vocal supporter of Russian-backed separatists. There was speculation how free she was to say what she wanted. Marianna says to me: ""I had to describe the whole situation, as I saw it with my own eyes."" My conversation with her was also arranged via Denis. Marianna speaks to me from his home. He is present throughout our chat but doesn't interrupt. Marianna's relatives and friends have assured me she is now safe. Much of what she says in her interview with me undermines the Russian government's mistruths. The Kremlin wrongly and repeatedly suggested the hospital that was attacked was Mariupol's hospital number one, and that it was no longer operational. But the BBC's disinformation team identified the hospital where Marianna was - hospital number three. We contacted the Russian Embassy in London for comment. Marianna confirms that the hospital was definitely treating her and other patients - contrary to Russian claims that it was not functioning as a health care facility. Russia also claimed that the hospital had been taken over by the Azov regiment - the controversial Ukrainian nationalist group that has been linked with neo-Nazis, allegations they themselves deny. Comments Marianna made in her interview with Denis were cherry-picked by Russian officials to claim soldiers forced Marianna and the other pregnant women to act as human shields. But Marianna told me there were no Ukrainian military stationed in the building where she was. She says she saw Ukrainian soldiers in the oncology unit in the building opposite the maternity unit. It's unclear whether they were based there or not. Nevertheless, Marianna's interview with Denis Seleznev was used by the Kremlin to suggest further falsehoods. Russian officials have seized on her comments that she doesn't believe the explosions at the hospital were caused by an airstrike, implying that the damage was Ukrainian shelling. ""The typical sound a plane makes when it flies overhead is impossible to miss,"" Marianna tells me, saying that she did not hear one. But here she is mistaken. The AP journalists documented evidence it was an airstrike, including video where a plane can be heard. At the scene both a soldier and a police officer say the attack was an airstrike. Also visible in photos is a huge crater which munition experts say could only have been caused by an airstrike. ""I personally did not see this crater, but I saw the video of it,"" Marianna says. ""In reality I can't blame anyone - because I didn't see with my own eyes where for certain [the explosions] came from."" This fresh controversy sparked a new wave of online vitriol. ""Some people said that I was an actress, others said that I was lying about the fact that there were no air raids,"" she says. Even some she regarded as friends don't believe her. Fellow beauty blogger Yaroslava lives in Russia and continues to believe state TV claims that Marianna was acting. ""I think that Marianna played her part. That Ukraine needed the Ukrainian military to blame everything on Russia."" Yaroslava told me. She's since unfollowed Marianna on Instagram - and doesn't want to speak to her again. ""It's a pity when people I know believe in something that I haven't done,"" Marianna says. But she brightens whenever the conversation turns to baby Veronika. Marianna has returned to blogging and in a recent post told readers to stick around if they were interested in ""cosmetics, nappies and the everyday life of a new mum"". Her message to those who want to send her hate was ""go in peace"". But unwillingly finding herself at the centre of an information war - as the military conflict continues - has changed Marianna's life forever. ""You know, for now I'm not thinking about my hopes or making plans, because we don't know what tomorrow will bring."" Listen to War on Truth on BBC Sounds "

Earlier, the regional governor said counter-attacking Ukrainian troops in the area had reached the border with Russia. Ukraine's defence ministry posted a video showing a number of soldiers gathered around a yellow-and-blue-painted border demarcation post. The region's governor said troops had restored a sign marking the border. However, the claim has not yet been verified. Ukraine's presidency said in a briefing that Russia had continued strikes on the Luhansk region, south of Kharkiv, killing two people and injuring nine others as a result of shelling on a Severodonetsk hospital. *This report contains material some readers will find disturbing* At the same time, new details have emerged of the horrors left behind in Bucha after the Russians withdrew. In a cold, damp basement on the edge of the woods that made Bucha a popular getaway spot before the war, five Ukrainian men were forced to their knees and shot in the head. To the right of the entrance, there were stones coated in blood that had turned dark red. Lying among that was a blue woollen hat with an exit hole in one side and its rim soaked in blood. The BBC's Sarah Rainsford, reporting from the scene, counted at least a dozen bullet holes in the wall. A couple of steps away were the remains of a Russian military ration pack - an open can of rice porridge with beef and an empty packet of crackers. A name daubed in graffiti on a wall was a reminder that the scene had been a children's camp. But when Russian troops moved into Bucha, just outside the capital, in early March, Camp Radiant became an execution ground. Read the full report by BBC Eastern Europe correspondent, Sarah Rainsford. In a BBC exclusive, Quentin Sommerville and Darren Conway join Ukrainian troops on the edge of Izyum, where Russian forces are concentrated. As our correspondent witnessed, Vladimir Putin has turned day into night along Ukraine's eastern front, forcing people underground.

The fast food giant said it made the decision because of the ""humanitarian crisis"" and ""unpredictable operating environment"" caused by the Ukraine war.

Official statistics show that 2,021 of those had been sponsored by individuals and the rest by the Welsh government. So far, just over a third of the refugees have arrived in Wales. Cardiff, Monmouthshire and Pembrokeshire have had the most sponsors, while Blaenau Gwent and Merthyr Tydfil have the fewest. Almost 40,000 Ukrainians have arrived in the UK after fleeing the Russian invasion. The UK visa scheme has come in for criticism from family members and potential hosts who have said it takes too long for visas to be approved. Home Secretary Priti Patel apologised for the ""frustrating"" delays. The UK government had faced pressure - including from some Conservative MPs - to issue emergency visas, or lift visa requirements altogether for Ukrainian refugees, but rejected such calls. EU countries allow Ukrainian refugees in for up to three years without a visa. The Welsh government said the data was a ""useful study"" but largely relates to those who arrived under the Ukraine Family Scheme. A spokesperson added: ""Wales had a small Ukrainian population prior to the recent conflict and it is therefore inevitable that the proportion of Ukrainians arriving in Wales would be small compared to other parts of the UK with larger pre-existing Ukrainian communities. ""Our 'super sponsor' route was available from 25 March and initially the processing of visas by the UK government was slow. Therefore, there will be significant lag in this dataset. The speed of visa processing is a matter for the UK government. ""Through our Team Wales approach, we continue to work closely with our partners to ensure all the wraparound services are in place to support people arriving from Ukraine."" "

Named ""Hedgehog"", the drills involve 10 countries, including Finland and Sweden, which are expected to formally apply to join the alliance within days. The exercises in Estonia, which will last until 3 June, were arranged before Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Vladimir Putin has said Russia has no issue with Finland or Sweden, but a military expansion near its border would demand a reaction. Sweden on Monday confirmed its intention to apply for Nato membership, joining Finland, which declared its position last week. Nato has said the aim of the exercises is to ""enhance the readiness and interoperability"" of its forces. Some 15,000 troops are involved in the exercise in Estonia, making it one of the largest military drills held in the country since 1991. The exercise is taking place 64km (40 miles) from Russia's nearest military base. It is intended to simulate an attack from Russia on Estonia. Russia sees Nato as a security threat and has warned of ""consequences"" for the prospective new members. Sweden stayed neutral in World War Two and for more than two centuries has avoided joining military alliances. Finland, meanwhile, shares a 1,300-km (810-mile) border with Russia. Until now, it has stayed out of Nato to avoid antagonising its eastern neighbour. The exercises were planned before Russia's invasion of Ukraine on 24 February. But amid the growing security threat from Russia, they are being closely watched. Finland and Sweden confirmed they will apply for Nato membership, on Thursday and Sunday respectively. They are expected to hand in their formal bids to join the alliance on Wednesday. Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg suggested that there could be a fast-track process to the two countries' application, with interim security arrangements put in place to deal with any possible Russian retaliation. Despite its rather cosy codename, Nato Exercise Hedgehog (""Siil"" in Estonian) is taking place at a time of heightened tensions in the Baltics, says BBC security correspondent Frank Gardner. Russia's invasion of Ukraine has convinced governments in the region that they need to seriously beef up their defences if they are to deter President Putin from further military aggression, our correspondent adds. Estonian Foreign Minister Eva-Maria Liimets said: ""We see that once our close neighbours and friends would join Nato, then of course, the overall security environment in our region would increase and especially around the Baltic Sea."" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has said Russia was watching the expansion closely, adding that he was convinced it would not strengthen the security of Europe. ""This is a serious issue, an issue that raises our concern, and we will follow very carefully,"" he said. Across Europe, other Nato exercises are being held in Poland, North Macedonia and Lithuania.

Before the war, the laconic Ukrainian was a lawyer. Now he sat in the front of a Mitsubishi pick-up, barrelling along a dirt road at 65mph (100km/h). Three of us were crammed in the back and the seat belts didn't work. But that was the least of anyone's worries - up ahead lay our destination, and it was being shelled by Russian artillery. The car swerved to avoid a spent Russian shell stuck in the earth. ""Cluster bomb,"" said Serhiy. It felt as though it could be a marker - a warning to travel no further. ""Do you want to see the village first, or our bunker?"" he asked as the green pickup lurched to a halt. ""Bunker,"" cameraman Darren Conway and I said in unison. Vladimir Putin has turned day into night along Ukraine's eastern front, forcing people underground. This village lay at the edge of Izyum, where Russian forces are concentrated. The artillery barrage was ending as we descended into the cool darkness of the shelter. After its failure to take the whole country, Russia is focused instead on taking Ukraine in pieces. The men in the bunker - and there are many of them - are here to ensure that doesn't happen. Izyum is in Russian hands, it's called the gateway to Donbas. During Russia's Victory Day celebrations last week, they crossed live on television from Moscow to occupiers in the city. Bare bulbs lit the dark space in the bunker - the new home to the group of volunteer fighters who are part of Ukraine's Territorial Defence. It could have been a scene from earlier wars, except it was pimped by technology. A widescreen TV showed live feeds from powerful spy cameras trained on Russian positions. ""A gift from our friends,"" one commander told me, indicating they had come from western governments. The men sat around scrolling through Instagram and Facebook, messaging wives and lovers. If frontline troops have their way, Elon Musk will be made a hero of Ukraine. His Starlink satellite network provides free internet to men across the battle space. The shelling restarted outside, loud enough to make the cobwebs on the ceiling dance. ""The Russians have finished their cigarette break,"" another fighter said, rising from his army cot. It was time for us to move. We were to accompany a foot patrol, some of it across open ground, to the first line of defence. Outside a dove called out, and everything was still. Then somewhere I could hear automatic gunfire. ""Don't bunch up,"" we were instructed, as we walked in single file through the ruined village. Of course, it would make us more of a target, but it is hard to resist the urge when under fire. Incoming shelling restarted in earnest - one shell squealed overhead and hit not far away. A Russian tank was operating nearby, and then the mortar fire started, too. The men leading us moved steadily through back yards and gardens, avoiding roads and trying to stay out of sight of spotter drones. I ducked as another shell whistled overhead and exploded 300m away. ""If you can hear them, it isn't for you,"" said Yuri who was accompanying us. It is the ones you don't hear that kill you. It's the third time in this war that someone has cracked that grim joke. The men pressed on and we reached our destination. It was much further than we'd been led to believe. Inside, the unit was having lunch, apparently unbothered by the constant explosions. ""God save the Queen,"" said Yuri pointing out a British-supplied anti-tank weapon. ""Thank you, Mr Johnson, we need more,"" he said with a laugh. It struck me that what these men needed was armoured vehicles - I didn't see any during the whole day at the front. We waited out the latest barrage. Surely it was time for the Russians to take another cigarette break? Then we were on the move again, fresh craters along our route and the smell of cordite and smoke in the air. The ground was littered with enemy munitions. More from Quentin Sommerville We passed byres and stables, wary looking cows and nervy sheep still in their pens. When the villagers had fled, they had no time to save their livestock, the only sign of life. But then, improbably, a woman with red hair and green eye make-up came out of her house, as if to see what all the commotion was about. Natasha began to cry. She told us she couldn't leave her village because her husband was buried here. It would be a betrayal, she said. The shelling reached a new crescendo, the patrol was pinned down, and even Natasha ducked. ""Would you boys like some borscht?"" she asked. Instead, we took cover in her garden underground larder, where jars of preserved vegetables were turning bad on the wooden shelves. Finally, the sound of outgoing artillery. Ukrainian shells headed over Natasha's house seeking Russian targets. We took that as our signal to leave, but Natasha refused to come. Her husband's portrait was still hanging on her sitting room wall, she said. The defence unit said they would send someone back for her. Back in the operations den, the men were crowded around the surveillance screen. Twenty Russian infantry, with mortars, had been trying to attack the village while we were with the patrol. The Ukrainian guns didn't find them, so today like many other days, stalemate reigned. But the defenders' lines were unbreached and the men around us had again done their duty. The gateway to Donbas remained closed. Defeat in the west of the country has sharpened Russia's focus to Izyum, where it has its command headquarters, and Donbas to the south, where a long war has been fought against separatists seeking to break away Donetsk and Luhansk. But even concentrated there, Russia struggles to advance. But our day wasn't over. The Russians were still firing and we needed to get back across those exposed roads and out of range of their guns. It was dusk when Serhiy arrived in his green pickup. Perhaps he was in a good mood, or maybe it was more frontline humour, but he was humming God Save the Queen. Before we had set off on the day's journey, I'd met a veteran American journalist who had been to the same front, 'You'll pray on your way in, and you'll pray on your way out,"" she said. As I ran through the Lord's Prayer in my head, we accelerated across the fields and hit something hard in the road. Thankfully for the second time in its short life, a Russian shell that had landed in the dirt didn't explode. Follow Quentin on Twitter @sommervilletv © 2022 BBC.

The French carmaker said it would sell its 68% interest to a Russian science institute, while its shares in Renault Russia will go to the city of Moscow. Moscow said Renault's Russian assets had now become state property. It is the first Russian nationalisation of a major foreign business since the invasion of Ukraine. ""Agreements were signed on the transfer of Russian assets of the Renault Group to the Russian Federation and the government of Moscow,"" Russia's industry and trade ministry said. Financial details of the deal were not provided, but in April Russian Industry and Trade Minister Denis Manturov said Renault planned to sell its Russian assets for ""one symbolic rouble"". In a statement on Monday, Renault Group said its board of directors had approved agreements to sell Renault Russia to the Moscow city entity, as well as its 67.69% stake in Avtovaz to the Russian Central Research and Development Automobile and Engine Institute (Nami). The deal also included Renault's Moscow plant, Avtoframos, which makes Renault and Nissan models. Moscow mayor Sergei Sobyanin said production at the plant would now resume under the Soviet-era Moskvich brand. Renault boss Luca de Meo said: ""Today, we have taken a difficult but necessary decision; and we are making a responsible choice towards our 45,000 employees in Russia, while preserving the group's performance and our ability to return to the country in the future, in a different context."" The agreement, which Renault said would cost the company an estimated €2.2bn ($2.29bn), includes an option for the group to buy back its interest in Avtovaz for six years. Avtovaz is Russia's largest carmaker and makes the country's popular Lada brand. In March, Renault announced it was suspending operations at its Moscow factory. It came after Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky called on Renault and other French companies to leave Russia, accusing them of ""financing the murders of women and children"". Renault's chief executive Luca de Meo said the firm was making a responsible choice - but just how much choice did it actually have? In the early stages of the conflict, the company prevaricated, choosing to remain in Russia while other international brands were leaving. But after being name-checked by Ukraine's President Zelensky, who said Western firms in Russia were helping to finance Vladimir Putin's war, it suspended its operations in late March. Abandoning its Russian business will be costly - Renault's own estimate is $2.3bn. It will lose a major market once seen as a key avenue for growth. And it will lose Lada as well - a brand that was central to Renault's strategy for affordable cars. Arguably, Renault could not remain in Russia. Yet the damage to its reputation has already been severe. Hundreds of international brands including Starbucks, Coca Cola, Levi's and Apple have left Russia since the country invaded Ukraine in February, with many now looking to sell their businesses in the country. Last week energy giant Shell announced it had agreed to sell more than 400 of its petrol stations in Russia to the country's second largest oil producer, Lukoil. Moscow has previously warned it may nationalise production plants or factories where work has been suspended. "
256,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-61461093,2022-05-16T04:57:17,Ukraine war: Global wheat prices jump after India export ban," The price of wheat has jumped on international markets after India banned the export of the staple cereal. The benchmark wheat index rose as much as 5.9% in Chicago, the highest it has been in two months. The export ban comes after a heatwave hit India's wheat crops, taking domestic prices to a record high. The cost of everything from bread and cakes to noodles and pasta has risen in recent months as wheat prices soared on world commodity markets. India's government said it would still allow exports backed by letters of credit that have already been issued, and to countries that request supplies ""to meet their food security needs"". Government officials also said the ban was not permanent and could be revised. However, the decision has been criticised by agriculture ministers from the Group of Seven (G7) nations meeting in Germany. ""If everyone starts to impose export restrictions or to close markets, that would worsen the crisis,"" German food and agriculture minister Cem Ozdemir said. The G7 is an organisation of the world's seven largest so-called ""advanced"" economies, which dominate global trade and the international financial system. They are Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK and the United States. Although India is the world's second-biggest wheat producer, it has not previously been a major exporter as most of its crop is sold on domestic markets. But Ukraine's wheat exports plunged after the Russian invasion. And with droughts and floods threatening crops in other major producers, commodity traders were expecting supplies from India to make up for part of the shortfall. Before the ban, India had aimed to ship a record 10 million tonnes of wheat this year. Vikas Pandey, India editor, BBC News Just a week ago, senior officials from India's commerce ministry told me that they were bullish about increasing the country's wheat exports to meet the surge in global demand. They echoed Prime Minister Narendra Modi's statement that ""India was ready to feed the world"". So, the ban does seem like a major policy U-turn. It also hints at the government's concerns over rising prices at home. But the decision could cause what one expert described as a foreign policy challenge for India. Delhi had been making noises to get a waiver from a World Trade Organization rule that makes it difficult for countries to export grains that - as the Indian government routinely does - are bought at a fixed price from farmers for official reserves. And some countries seemed willing to help India find a way to export wheat to the world. The same countries are now likely to be upset. Global food prices hit a fresh record high in March after the Ukraine war caused a ""giant leap"", according to the United Nations (UN). That came as the conflict cut off supplies from the world's biggest exporter of sunflower oil - Ukraine - which means the costs of alternatives also climbed. The country is also a major producer of cereals such as maize and wheat, which have risen sharply in price too. The UN said that global food prices eased slightly in April but remain almost 30% higher than the same time last year. Rising food prices, along with a jump in the cost of energy, have been pushing up inflation around that world. That has forced major central banks, including the US Federal Reserve and the Bank of England, to raise interest rates in an attempt to rein in rising prices. That, in turn, has triggered concerns that the higher cost of borrowing could hit global economic growth, with some high-profile commentators warning of a recession. On Sunday, Lloyd Blankfein, the senior chairman of Wall Street investment banking giant Goldman Sachs, said there is a ""very, very high risk"" of recession in the US, the world's biggest economy. Mr Blankfein's comments on CBS's Face the Nation came on the same day as Goldman Sachs economists cut their US economic growth forecasts for this year and next. "
257,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-61334470,2022-05-15T23:35:20,Ukraine crisis: Can Africa replace Russian gas supplies to Europe?," African countries are among those hoping to increase their exports of gas to the European Union, after the EU committed to reduce its reliance on Russian supplies following the invasion of Ukraine. Russia's suspension of deliveries to Poland and Bulgaria over their refusal to pay in roubles, the Russian currency, was a stark reminder of the threat facing the Eurozone. Russia has the largest natural gas reserves in the world and is the largest exporter, accounting for around 40% of Europe's imports. The EU wants to cut supplies by two-thirds by the end of the year and become independent of all its fossil fuels by 2030. However, energy economist Carole Nakhle says that with the combined exports of Africa's big players in the industry - Algeria, Egypt and Nigeria - amounting to less than half of what Russia supplies to Europe, they are ""unlikely at the moment to compensate for any losses in Russian supplies"". ""The good news is there will be greater interest in countries that already have the resources to replace Russian gas and Africa is in a very good position. We're going to see more investment,"" she says. However, this will take time because if various logistical issues in the continent's major exporters. Algeria is well positioned to benefit from the EU's shift in energy policy. The North African country is the region's biggest natural gas exporter and currently enjoys well developed gas connectivity infrastructure with Europe. Last month Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi signed a new gas supply deal with Algeria to increase gas imports by around 40%. It was Italy's first major deal to find alternative supplies following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. However, there are concerns over Algeria's ability to boost capacity due to rising domestic consumption, underinvestment in production and political instability, says Uwa Osadieye, the senior vice-president of Equity Research at FBNQuest Merchant Bank. He points out that the amount of gas exported from Algeria to Europe has fallen sharply recently because of a dispute with Morocco, leading to the closure of a vital pipeline to Spain, from 17 billion cubic feet a year to around nine billion. Pier Paolo Raimondi, an energy research fellow at Rome's Instituto Affari Internatzionali, echoes these concerns. ""The agreement will allow them to exploit the available pipeline transportation capacity and it could gradually provide increasing volumes of up to nine billion cubic metres per year in 2023 and 2024. [But] we don't know how fast Algeria can ramp up this production."" Despite the reservations, the deal has been hailed as a solid first step for Italy, which is the second-largest buyer of Russian gas in Europe. Italian ministers also travelled to Angola and Congo-Brazzaville, where they agreed new gas deals and Italy is eyeing opportunities in Mozambique in a bid to end its dependency on Russia by mid-2023. Meanwhile, West African liquified natural gas producer, Nigeria LNG, has been inundated with requests for gas from European countries since the start of the conflict in Ukraine. At present, Spain, Portugal and France are the three key destination markets for Nigeria LNG's product and the company is only able to honour its existing contracts with buyers, according to a source who wishes to remain anonymous. ""There is an opportunity to increase production. Today Nigeria LNG is just 72% plant-mobilised, which means there's still capacity of 28% to utilise, provided they're able to get the gas, and that's where the biggest challenge is right now,"" the source says. He cites myriad issues obstructing the company's ability to step up production, including declining gas wells and a lack of funding for upstream activities. ""They're things that can be fixed in the short term - between six to 18 months."" According to Andy Odeh, Nigeria LNG's General Manager of External Relations and Sustainable Development, discussions are ongoing with natural gas suppliers to resolves these issues and he hopes to increase LNG production levels ""from the end of this year onwards,"" he says. A new Nigeria LNG gas project, Train 7, will increase production capacity by 35% from the current 22 million tonnes per annum by 2025. However, contracts with buyers, largely in Europe, are already in place. Nigeria LNG is also conducting feasibility studies for an additional project, Train 8, to boost supplies further. The West African state is also a key player in the stalled Trans Saharan Pipeline project - a 4,400km (2,735 mile) natural gas pipeline that would run from Nigeria, through Niger to Algeria. It would connect to existing pipeline infrastructure in Algeria, linking West African countries to Europe. The project was mooted in the 1970s, but has been bedevilled by security threats, environmental concerns and a lack of funding. At a meeting in February, regional officials promised to finally get it going. However, Kayode Thomas, the head of Bell Oil & Gas, says that another project - the Nigeria-Morocco gas pipeline, which will connect infrastructure in West Africa to Morocco in order to reach Europe - is gaining traction. ""We're still not sure whether this will cannibalise the Trans Saharan pipeline or run alongside it,"" he says. The project, estimated to cost $25bn ($20bn) and connecting 13 West and North African countries, will be completed in stages over 25 years. Ms Nakhle says the shift to sourcing gas from Africa could also benefit countries such as Tanzania and Mozambique, although a huge project there run by French giant Total is currently on hold following a major attack by Islamist militants based in the area. ""There is great potential in Africa, but I would say that it's got to be very limited in the short-term because gas projects take time to materialise,"" she says. But in the medium- and long-term, ""you will see greater investment to increase the capacity to bring more gas out of the ground and bring them to Europe"". "
258,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-61442387,2022-05-15T23:28:02,Ukraine: The children's camp that became an execution ground," Since Russian forces were pushed back from Kyiv at the end of March, the bodies of more than 1,000 civilians have been discovered in the Bucha region - many hastily buried in shallow graves. The BBC has learned that around 650 people were shot in what a senior police official has described as executions. Sarah Rainsford has been investigating what happened at a children's summer camp - now being treated as a crime scene. *This report contains material some readers will find disturbing* It is easy to miss the killing spot at first in the gloom. But in a cold, damp basement on the edge of the woods that made Bucha a popular get-away spot before the war, five Ukrainian men were forced to their knees and shot in the head. To the right of the entrance, there are stones coated in blood that has turned dark red. Lying among that is a blue woollen hat with an exit hole in one side and its rim soaked in blood. In the wall, I counted at least a dozen bullet holes. A couple of steps away are the remains of a Russian military ration pack - an open can of rice porridge with beef and an empty packet of crackers. A name daubed in graffiti on a wall is a reminder that the scene is a children's camp. But when Russian troops moved into Bucha, just outside the capital, in early March, Camp Radiant became an execution ground. The story of the summer camp killings is chilling but so is this detail: more than 1,000 civilians were killed in the Bucha region during a month under Russian occupation, but most did not die from shrapnel or shelling. More than 650 were shot dead by Russian soldiers, according to a senior police official. Now Ukraine is searching for their killers. Volodymyr Boichenko lived in Hostomel, just up the road from Bucha and near the airfield where the first Russian forces landed to try to overthrow Ukraine's government. When his sister Aliona Mykytiuk decided to flee before the fighting reached her, she pleaded with Volodymyr to join her. He was a civilian, not a soldier, but he wanted to stay and help. So he spent the days searching Hostomel for food and water to bring to neighbours, including children, who were trapped in their cellars by the constant shelling and Russian airstrikes. A chatty 34-year-old, who had travelled the world in the merchant navy, Volodymyr phoned his family from Hostomel most days to reassure them he was safe. Aliona would wait nervously for his brief calls: she knew he had to move to higher ground to get a connection and if the shelling was heavy it was impossible to leave the bomb shelter. As supplies ran low, she urged her brother to try to escape but by then the roads were blocked. The last time Aliona heard from him was on 8 March. Volodymyr wasn't the demonstrative type, but that day he told his sister not to worry about him. ""He said 'I really love you,' and that was so painful to hear,"" Aliona sobs, rubbing her eyes hard but unable to stop the tears. ""There was fear in his voice."" Four days later, Volodymyr was spotted by neighbours close to Promenystyi, as it's known here, or Camp Radiant. Then he disappeared. In March, the fighting around Kyiv was intense and the small town of Bucha was at the epicentre. The withdrawal of Russian troops in early April revealed scenes that shocked the world: the bodies of residents slumped in the streets where they'd been shot. Moscow tells anyone who will listen that the killings were staged, an idea that is as twisted as it is patently false. Determined to hold those responsible to account, Ukrainian investigators are busy collecting the hard evidence on territory now back under their control. ""We don't know what Putin's plans are, so we are working as quickly as possible in case he drops a bomb and destroys all the proof,"" says Kyiv regional police chief, Andrii Niebytov. That evidence includes a field full of civilian cars pierced with multiple bullet holes, now piled up on the edge of Bucha. They are vehicles that were shot at when families tried to flee. One still has a length of white cloth at the window, hung to show the soldiers that its occupants were no threat. Step too close, and you catch the sickly smell of death. When the bodies beneath Camp Radiant were discovered on 4 April, Volodymyr Boichenko was among them. Aliona had spent weeks frantically calling hospitals and morgues. That day she was sent a photograph to identify. She knew it was her brother before it had even downloaded. ""I hate them with every cell of my being,"" Aliona cries, about Volodymyr's killers. ""I know that's wrong to say about people, but they are not human. There was not one patch on those men's bodies that was not beaten."" The five men had been found crouching on their knees, heads down and hands bound behind their backs. ""We know they had been tortured,"" the police chief told the BBC. ""The Russian army has crossed the line of how war is conducted. They were not fighting the military in Ukraine, they were kidnapping and torturing the civilian population."" Neither the Prosecutor's Office nor the SBU security service will disclose details of ongoing investigations, but some Russian military were so careless at covering their tracks that there are likely to be considerable clues to work with. Ukrainian territorial defence units have even discovered lists of soldiers at some abandoned positions. One appears to be part of a rota for litter duty, another includes passport details and mobile phone numbers. With such a vast volume of work - more than 11,000 potential war crimes cases registered so far - Ukraine's security services have called on more digitally savvy civilians for help. ""I feel some call of duty,"" said Dmytro Replianchuk, a journalist at slidstvo.info who worked to expose corruption within Ukraine's law enforcement bodies before the war. Now he's joined forces with prosecutors, scouring the internet for extra data to help catch suspected war criminals. ""I understand it will be so hard and a lot of cases won't be solved. But in these weeks, it's important to find as much information as possible,"" Dmytro explained. We found one potential clue among the litter at Camp Radiant - the wrapping from a parcel sent by a woman named Ksyukha to a Russian soldier whose own name and military unit are clearly marked. Unit 6720 is based in Rubtsovsk, in the Altai region of Siberia. It has been linked to Bucha before when soldiers from the town were caught on CCTV sending giant packages to relatives full of goods that they had looted from Ukrainian homes. We can't be sure yet whether soldiers from Rubtsovsk were based at the children's camp, or were there when the men were killed. The police first need to establish a more precise time of death. ""We are working on it, but it's not a quick thing,"" Mr Niebytov explains. ""But that camp was a headquarters so there would have been a commander. The soldiers could not have executed anyone without the commander's knowledge. So we will first find the organisers and then look for the implementers."" Across the road from Camp Radiant, behind a church spattered with shrapnel damage, a corner of Bucha is slowly showing renewed signs of life. Young boys run around the yard, while a man fixes sheets of wood to windows shattered when the town was being shelled, constantly. And a little shop has just reopened to serve others now trickling back to begin their own repairs. As neighbours cross paths, they discuss the days when Russian tanks rolled into their town, the soldiers who would shoot wildly and those who roamed the streets drunk, breaking into homes and stealing from them. And they remember the local man who escaped to their block of flats from the summer camp opposite, and who they had sheltered despite the risk. Viktor Sytnytskyi didn't know Camp Radiant before, but all the details he gives match up. He's now in western Ukraine and told me his story over the phone, calling from his car so he wouldn't upset his mother. It was early March when Viktor was grabbed by Russian soldiers on the street. They tied his hands and pulled his hat down over his eyes, then dragged him to a cellar that he's sure was on the grounds of the children's camp. There, the Russians poured water over his legs so he would freeze, and they held a gun to his head. ""They kept saying, 'Where's the fascists? Where's the troops? Where's Zelensky? One of them mentioned Putin so I said something rude and he hit me,"" Viktor recalls. He remembers being angry at his captors as well as terrified. He had worked in Moscow in the past with men from Siberia and was horrified that Russians could now treat him with such brutality. Even more so, when one of the soldiers revealed that he, too, was from Siberia. Viktor told him he was sad things had come to this. ""The sad thing is that our grandfathers fought together against the Nazis and now you're the fascists,"" was the Russian's angry reply. ""He told me: 'You have until the morning to remember what you've seen, and if not, you'll be shot.'"" That night, Viktor got lucky. There was heavy shelling and when he realised his captors were no longer guarding him, he ran for his life. ""I calculated that I had more chance of surviving under shelling than if I stayed in that cellar. They'd already put the gun to my head. What would it cost them to pull the trigger?"" From a common grave beneath the children's camp, Volodymyr Boichenko has now been given a proper burial beneath the cherry blossom in the old cemetery of Bucha. After his funeral, Aliona says she finally saw her brother's face in her dreams again, as if he were comforting her. But she still has many questions. The cross on Volodymyr's grave is marked only with his birthday, not the date of his death, because the family have no idea when he was shot. They may never know, unless the Russian commander who took over Camp Radiant can be found. Like everyone in Bucha, though, they do know that civilians are not only caught up in this war. They are being targeted - by Russian soldiers who either don't know the rules of war, or don't care.

Finland formally confirmed it would apply to join the defensive military alliance, with the country's President Sauli Niinisto describing the decision as ""historic"". Mr Niinisto said he had spoken to Russian President Vladimir Putin about it, describing the conversation as ""direct and straight-forward"" and ""conducted without aggravations"". President Putin had previously told Finland such a move would be a ""mistake"". Meanwhile in Sweden the ruling Social Democrats backed joining the security alliance, paving the way for the country to apply formally. Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson said two centuries of military non-alignment had served her country well, but might not do so in the future after Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The party said it would ""work toward"" membership, something supported by about half the public and most opposition parties. But it also expressed opposition to stationing nuclear weapons or hosting Nato bases. Read more about Sunday's dramatic shift in European diplomacy here. On the battlefield, Russia's war in Ukraine is not going to plan and its efforts to capture the eastern Donbas region have ""stalled"", according to Nato's secretary general. Speaking at a meeting of Nato foreign ministers, Jens Stoltenberg said the Russian military was failing to achieve its strategic objectives. Mr Stoltenberg's comments, where he also said Ukraine could win the conflict, come amid other damning assessments of Russian tactics, military capabilities and resources. The UK's Ministry of Defence (MoD) estimates the Russia military has lost about a third of its ground combat force since the war began in February. The MoD's assessment of Russian losses includes men killed or wounded and equipment destroyed or captured. It said the Donbas offensive has ""lost momentum and fallen significantly behind schedule"" and Russia was constrained by ""continued low morale and reduced combat effectiveness"". Click here for more about developments on the ground in Ukraine. Victory at the Eurovision song contest has brought joy to Ukrainian refugees watching from other European countries and people watching from Ukraine itself. Ivanna Khvalyboga, who fled to Poland after the invasion, said the success of Kalush Orchestra's folk-rap song Stefania meant ""incredible happiness"". Meanwhile President Volodymyr Zelensky congratulated the group and said his country's courage ""impresses the world"". He also vowed one day to host Eurovision in a ""free, peaceful and rebuilt"" Mariupol, the devastated port city that is now mostly under Russian control but where a group of Ukrainian fighters continue to hold out in a vast steelworks. Kalush Orchestra - who appealed to the world to help the last Ukrainian fighters in Mariupol's Azovstal steelworks - stormed in to the lead late in the day off the back of huge public support. Stefania was written as a tribute to lead singer Oleh Psiuk's mother, but the emotive lyrics are also regarded as a rallying cry and tribute to Ukraine.

Russia is accusing Ukrainian forces of blowing up a fertiliser storage facility, deploying a familiar tactic to falsely blame an adversary for attacks it has not carried out Russia's defence ministry claims the attack was designed so Ukrainians could then accuse Russian forces of having used chemical weapons. Ukrainian security forces are also accused by Russia of attempting to set up a second ""false flag"" event, by appealing for bodies to be used to ""simulate a Russian air attack"". There's no evidence that either of these claims is true. Moscow has a history of falsely accusing its opponents of staging ""provocations"" which either never happened at all, or were subsequently carried out by themselves or their allies. Our full analysis of Russia's claims is available here. "

In Sweden, the governing Social Democrats said they backed joining the Western security alliance, paving the way for the country to apply. The announcement came soon after Finland formally announced it too would apply to join the grouping. Russia sees Nato as a security threat and has warned of ""consequences"". Sweden stayed neutral in World War II and for more than two centuries has avoided joining military alliances. Finland shares a 1,300-km (810-mile) border with Russia. Until now, it has stayed out of Nato to avoid antagonising its eastern neighbour. In a statement, Sweden's Social Democrats said they would ""work toward"" membership, something supported by the public and most opposition parties. A formal application is likely within days. But the Social Democrats added that they were opposed to stationing nuclear weapons or hosting Nato bases. At a subsequent press conference, Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson said her party believed joining the alliance was ""best for Sweden's and the Swedish people's security"". ""For us Social Democrats, it is clear that the military non-alignment has served Sweden well, but our conclusion is that it won't serve us as well in the future,"" she added. She also said Sweden would be left in a ""vulnerable position"" if it was the only country in the Baltic region that was not a Nato member. Finland's President Sauli Niinisto earlier confirmed his country would apply, calling it a ""historic day"". He spoke to Russia's President Vladmir Putin about the decision, saying he wanted to ""say it straight"". ""I, or Finland, are not known to sneak around and quietly disappear behind a corner,"" he said. Russia's president had previously told Finland it would be a ""mistake"" to join Nato, which was founded in 1949 to counter the threat from the Soviet Union. President Putin mentioned Ukraine's intention to join the alliance as one of the reasons for the invasion. The Social Democrats chose to announce their decision to back Nato membership with a low-key statement, half an hour before a scheduled news conference. But their decision is monumental, paving the way for Sweden to move away from a position of military neutrality for the first time in two centuries. The announcement isn't surprising. Social Democrat ministers backed the findings of a cross-party report on Friday which concluded that membership would increase security in northern Europe and would be unlikely to trigger an armed attack from Russia. Meanwhile public support for formally joining Nato has grown steadily since Russia invaded Ukraine. Most opposition parties are in favour, with just months to go until Sweden's next general election. Still there are some within the Social Democrats - and in the opposition Left and Green parties - who are anxious about joining. Not everyone's convinced it makes military aggression from Russia less likely. Others are already mourning the loss of a national identity as a neutral, peaceful nation that's used to staying out of major global conflicts. Foreign ministers of Nato countries, who are meeting in Berlin, have pledged to provide security guarantees for both Finland and Sweden while their bids to join Nato are being ratified by all member states - a process that can take up to a year. German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said there could not be a ""transition period, a grey zone, where their status is unclear"". Meanwhile both US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said they were confident of overcoming Turkish objections to both Finland and Sweden's membership. Turkey, a Nato member state, accuses both Nordic countries of having given support to the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), which has been waging an armed struggle against the Turkish government for decades. On Sunday Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said Sweden and Finland must stop supporting terrorists in their countries, provide clear security guarantees and lift export bans on Turkey. But he added that Turkey was not threatening anybody or seeking leverage. Mr Blinken said he had heard strong support for the Nordic countries ""almost across the board"" and he had held talks with his Turkish counterpart - ""If that's [joining Nato] what they choose to do, I'm very confident that we will reach consensus on that,"" he said. Mr Niinisto has said he is ready to hold talks with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Turkish media reported. Both Sweden and Finland have Kurdish communities, and in Sweden's case some parliamentarians have Kurdish origins. Turkey has not provided proof that these communities have links with the PKK. "

Jens Stoltenberg also said Ukraine could win the conflict. Britain's Ministry of Defence (MoD) estimates Russia has lost about a third of its ground combat force since the war began in February. The Russian invasion has been hampered by stiff Ukrainian resistance and logistical issues. Its initial goal appeared to be to sweep across the country and topple the Ukrainian government. Instead, Russia has withdrawn from areas around the capital Kyiv after failing to capture it and since mid-April has been focusing its efforts on two eastern provinces. In Ukraine's second city of Kharkiv, officials say Russian forces have withdrawn from to the border and that residents were returning. ""Russia's war in Ukraine is not going as Moscow had planned,"" said Mr Stoltenberg. ""They failed to take Kyiv, they are pulling back from around Kharkiv, their major offensive in Donbas has stalled. Russia is not achieving its strategic objectives."" Mr Stoltenberg was speaking at a meeting of Nato foreign ministers. On top of the military setbacks, another consequence of the invasion is that Russia will likely face an expanded Nato with Sweden and Finland set to join. Russia's President Vladimir Putin sees Nato as a security threat to Russia and invaded Ukraine in part to stop it joining Nato. In its assessment, the MoD's estimate of Russia's losses cover men killed or wounded and equipment destroyed or captured. The MoD said Russia's Donbas offensive had ""lost momentum and fallen significantly behind schedule"". It said Russia was constrained by ""continued low morale and reduced combat effectiveness"". The British Foreign Secretary, Liz Truss, said Ukraine's allies must keep up their military support to help it ""push Russia out"". On the ground. Ukrainian forces are counterattacking in the city of Izyum, regional governor Oleh Sinegubov said, something that could complicate Russian plans to capture the Donbas. However Ukraine's military also acknowledged setbacks in its latest updates, saying Russia was advancing in several areas in the region. There has been no let up for the remaining Ukrainian forces in Mariupol, with Russia continuing its bombardment of the steelworks where they are holed up. Video purportedly from inside showed men checking their phones and playing chess. And in western Ukraine, the governor of the Lviv region said missiles had targeted military infrastructure. "

Rachel Young, a psychotherapist and counsellor, from Riseley, Bedfordshire, said it was to help those deal with trauma they were seeing and hearing. They volunteered on behalf of the Cambridgeshire-based organisation, Ollie and his Super Powers. Ali Dawes Knowles, from the group, said she had ""never seen so much trauma"". For two days, the women worked with volunteers running a refugee hostel in Krakow to establish ""strategies to support themselves and the refugees"", Ms Young said. ""The volunteers are on their knees working 24/7, so we were giving them psychological support to them and the refugees as well. ""There is a huge amount of trauma they are going to hear about."" She was there as a coach and a therapist. ""It was to give people we saw the tools to be able to manage their emotional wellbeing and the refugees' emotional wellbeing,"" she added. ""When something like this happens you feel powerless but if I was able to just do something, even if it was a drop in the ocean, hopefully it will make some difference."" Ms Dawes Knowles, from Bluntisham, Cambridgeshire, who started Ollie and his Super Powers, said: ""We can't heal the world but for this one centre of many [we'll] make sure those volunteers have some mental health first aid for themselves so they don't collapse and we can also put a team out there to provide a clinic to deal with the deeper trauma. ""I've never seen so much horror and trauma, we're not walking away. ""I'm now looking at what we can do, not what we can't.""

Speaking from Poland, she told the BBC the win meant ""incredible happiness for Ukraine and Ukrainian people"". Kalush Orchestra won the competition, beating the UK and Spain to clinch the top spot. The group had been predicted to take the title as support rose following Russia's invasion. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky congratulated Kalush Orchestra and said Ukraine's courage ""impresses the world"". In a post on Instagram, he vowed one day to host Eurovision in a ""free, peaceful and rebuilt"" Mariupol, referencing the port city that is mostly under Russian control. Kalush Orchestra talked about Mariupol and the Azovstal steelworks at the end of their performance, a move praised by people online. ""I'm sure many people will search the internet for information about Mariupol and Azovstal and it's great,"" one person wrote on the messaging service Telegram. ""We need attention, a lot of attention."" Yura Solodzhuk, the administrator of a Ukrainian Eurovision fan page, who was forced to flee his country, told the BBC he was shocked at the win but said it would ""help attract the world's attention again"". ""It's important to remind the world about us again and again, that Ukrainian music and culture exists,"" he said. The group's song Stefania was written as a tribute to lead singer Oleh Psiuk's mother, but its emotive lyrics have been interpreted as a rallying cry and tribute to the nation. ""Stefania is heard every day on the front line of our fighters as a call for freedom,"" Ann Fedirko told the BBC from Ukraine. ""Every soldier remembers his mother, who prays for him at night and he has to win a free life for her."" ""This song is like our blood, which is now on the lips of every Ukrainian,"" she added. Celebrations are mainly muted with people unable to celebrate in public places due to curfews in place across the country. Many people watched the contest from home. In one flat in Kyiv where seven friends gathered for their annual Eurovision watch party, emotions ran high. After a nail-biting wait for results, the friends rejoiced and hugged while waving Ukrainian flags and spraying a bottle of prosecco. ""It is something that unites us with the whole Europe,"" said Denys. ""For us it is very important to be a part of this. Especially this year."" No parties in a bar or a club are possible in Ukraine because of a curfew that's been in place since the Russian invasion in February. So the group of friends are staying locked in together until the early hours. ""I feel happy, there was so much tension!"" Alina, who is hosting the party, said. Her message to the viewers who chose Ukraine as the winner? ""You voted for peace, for freedom and future."" ""In Ukraine we have war and some say it's not a time to have fun,"" her friend Natalia explained. ""But we need to have fun, we need to live and have understanding and feeling of life."" ""Now we see support of the whole world and it feels great."" Now Ukraine have won, there will need to be a discussion about where next year's Eurovision event could be hosted. The winner usually hosts the show the following year, but depending on the situation in Ukraine, the European Broadcasting Union will have to come to a decision as to where it could be held. But for now, Ukrainians are focused on what it feels like to be victorious and what it could symbolise for the future. As refugee Ivanna Khvalyboga, who is currently in Poland, put it: ""We have won Eurovision, we will win the war with Russia!"" Additional reporting by Hanna Chornous and Siobhan Leahy in Kyiv "
265,https://www.bbc.com/news/61439398,2022-05-15T01:54:13,Ukraine conflict: Russian chemical attack claim fact-checked," Russia is using a familiar tactic to blame an adversary for attacks it has not carried out - on this occasion accusing Ukrainian forces of blowing up a fertiliser storage facility. The purpose of the attack, says Russia's defence ministry, was so that the Ukrainians could then accuse Russian forces of having launched a chemical weapons attack. Russia also claims that the Ukrainian security forces have attempted to set up a second ""false flag"" event, by appealing for bodies to be used to ""simulate a Russian air attack"". There's no evidence that either of these claims is true. Moscow has a history of falsely accusing its opponents of staging ""provocations"" which either never happened at all, or were subsequently carried out by themselves or their allies. A Russian Ministry of Defence briefing on 11 May asserted that Ukrainian forces had ""carried out an explosion of a tanker with fertiliser, presumably ammonium nitrate, which resulted in a cloud of orange smoke that dissipated after some time"". According to Moscow, the aim of the explosion, which occurred in the Kharkiv region, was to accuse Russia of using chemical weapons in order to ""extract additional military aid from the West by the Kyiv regime"". No evidence was given in support of the claim that Ukrainian forces were responsible for the explosion. The location in a video showing the plumes of orange smoke rising into the sky was identified using satellite imagery as Dolgenkoye, an agricultural region near the city of Kharkiv. One Ukrainian media outlet quoted reports on Telegram that the cloud of smoke formed after ""a Russian drone hit an object"". Following the explosion, Oleksiy Arestovych, an adviser to the head of the Ukrainian president's office, said he did not believe it was a Russian chemical weapon attack, although he did add the qualification that he would have to ""clarify such preliminary data"". The BBC was unable to find evidence of Ukrainian officials subsequently accusing Russia of using chemical weapons in this incident. Video and satellite imagery showing the farm buildings hit are consistent with an explosion where facilities containing ammonium nitrate have been set on fire - releasing a characteristic orange-coloured cloud, says Wim Zwijnenburg, an arms researcher at Pax, a Dutch humanitarian organisation. Mr Zwijnenburg says up to 40 similar agricultural facilities have been destroyed in Ukraine since the start of the Russian invasion in February. In recent weeks, Dolgenkoye has been the target of shelling from Russian forces, with satellite imagery showing various fields in the area scarred by shelling. Operation Z, a pro-Russian social-media channel with almost 800,000 subscribers recently claimed doctors in Ukraine had been instructed to take the bodies of women and children to a hospital, from where they would be transported to ""one of the social facilities in the city where an air raid allegedly by Russian aviation will be simulated"". The Telegram post on 12 May said: ""Ukrainian special services are preparing a provocation in the Dnieper (Dnipro) region to accuse the Russian military of killing civilians."" There is no evidence for this narrative, which follows other similar claims by pro-Russian media. In early April, the Russian ministry of defence said UK intelligence operatives were putting civilian bodies in basements in the Sumy region, who could then be portrayed in the West as victims of a ""Russian massacre"". Again, there's no evidence that this happened. Russia has a history of accusing its enemies of staging what it calls ""provocations"", by which it means attacks that can be blamed on Russia. In some cases the claims are to cover for attacks committed by Russia or its proxies; in others the claims refer to future events that might not happen at all. During the Syrian conflict, Moscow repeatedly accused the White Helmet civil defence group, the UK, the US, France and Belgium of preparing chemical attacks that they could then blame on Russia and Syria. However, inquiries into chemical attacks during the war have concluded that the Syrian government was responsible for the attacks on Douma and Ghouta. Prior to the invasion of Ukraine, the BBC reported on a number of false-flag events, including claims that a burned-out and bullet-ridden car was ""evidence"" of Ukrainian attacks on citizens. However, closer inspection of the Russian separatists' own photos of the incident revealed that the bodies inside had surgical incisions consistent with being recently cut open for post-mortem examination, and were already dead at the time of the alleged attack.

Instead Nato is likely to get another two. Sweden and Finland are pressing ahead with their efforts to join the security alliance, despite Russian warnings of retaliation. On Saturday, President Putin told Finnish counterpart Sauli Niinistö joining Nato would be a ""mistake"". In a sign of what may come, Russia suspended electricity supplies to Finland, although a Finnish energy chief said it had not caused any problems. You can read our round-up of diplomatic developments here On the ground, Ukrainian forces have been keeping up the pressure on Russia. Its army has launched a counteroffensive in Izyum in Kharkiv region, military officials say. Retaking the eastern city could complicate Russia's plans to capture the eastern Donbas region, the main focus of Russia since it withdrew from areas around the capital Kyiv. Most significantly, the mayor of Kharkiv, Ukraine's second largest city, said Russian forces had withdrawn in the direction of the border. One of our reporters in Ukraine has this assessment. Joe Inwood, BBC News Lviv On the outskirts of Kharkiv the retreating Russians left a parting gift. Dergachi's Palace of Culture is now a smouldering ruin, thanks to a final barrage of rocket artillery. But, it may be one of the last buildings in Ukraine's second city to suffer this fate. Kharkiv is called a fortress, and with good reason. It has withstood more than two months of constant bombardment. Its buildings and people have been battered, but never broken. Its defences never were breached The city's mayor, Ihor Terekhov, told the BBC people are starting to return - and that the battle has been won. ""There were no Russian troops inside the city of Kharkiv. Russian tanks and armoured fighting vehicles were eliminated by Ukrainian fighters. ""And due to the efforts of the Kharkiv territorial defence and Ukrainian Armed Forces, the Russians have now withdrawn far from the city - towards the border,"" Terekhov said. But, this was not a full-blown retreat as was seen around Kyiv. The Russian forces will hold lines further back, or re-join the fight elsewhere. This is not a turning point in the war for Ukraine, but it is still a major victory. Ukraine's national guard says at least 500 of its members have died since Russia's invasion more than two months ago. It's the first time the force has announced such fatality figures. Many fear the real number could be much higher. Behind each death, there are comrades left behind to mourn those who have lost their lives in battle. The BBC met one such soldier at a military cemetery on the outskirts of Dnipro. There are other, less visible battles going on. For years, Russia is suspected to have used its intelligence services to target the West - from interfering in elections, to poisonings and sabotage. The West has been carrying out acts of espionage on Russia as well. But now, in the face of the Ukraine war, this battle is intensifying. Our security correspondent Gordon Correra has this report And finally, at the time of writing this the Eurovision Song Contest is under way. The last time Ukraine won was in 2016, not long after Russia annexed Crimea and with a song about the deportation of Crimean Tatars under Soviet dictator Josef Stalin. Ukraine are favourites to win this year's contest, while Russia has been barred. BBC Ukraine's Viktoriia Zhuhan joined the Kalush Orchestra as they prepared for the contest in the war-torn city of Irpin. "

He told Sauli Niinistö there was no threat to Finland's security. The exchange came during a phone call made by the Finnish president, ahead of a formal request which Finland is expected to announce very soon. Sweden has also indicated its intention to join the Western alliance, following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Finland shares a 1,300-km (810-mile) border with Russia. Until now, it has stayed out of Nato to avoid antagonising its eastern neighbour. Mr Putin did not make a specific threat of retaliation over Finland's move, but the Russian foreign ministry has indicated there will be retaliation. Russia's decision to suspend electricity supplies to Finland is being seen as an early sign, however. In its statement, Russian energy supplier RAO Nordic mentioned problems with payments. Finland national grid executive Reima Paivinen told the BBC the Russian suspension had not caused any problems. He said Russian imports accounted for around 10% of national supply, adding that they could be replaced from alternative sources. Following the phone call between Mr Niinistö and Mr Putin on Saturday, the Kremlin said the Russian leader had stressed the ""end of the traditional policy of military neutrality would be a mistake since there is no threat to Finland's security"". It added: ""Such a change in the country's political orientation can have a negative impact on Russian-Finnish relations developed over years in a spirit of good neighbourliness and co-operation between partners."" Mr Niinistö said he had told Mr Putin how recent moves by Russia, along with the invasion of Ukraine, ""have altered the security environment of Finland"". ""The conversation was direct and straight-forward and it was conducted without aggravations. Avoiding tensions was considered important,"" he said. A possible stumbling block to Swedish and Finnish membership of Nato is Turkey, after President Recep Tayyip Erdogan accused both countries of harbouring ""terrorist organisations"" and said he did not support their applications. It was seen as a reference to the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which Turkey regards as a terrorist organisation. For decades the PKK has fought with Turkey for a Kurdish homeland. Turkey also objects to a Syrian Kurdish militia called the People's Protection Units (YPG) ,which they say is an extension of the PKK - even though they have been allied with the US in the fight against so-called Islamic State. Both Sweden and Finland have Kurdish communities, and in Sweden's case some parliamentarians have Kurdish origins. President Erdogan did not provide any proof that these communities had links with the PKK. Foreign ministers from Sweden, Turkey and Finland are meeting to try to iron out their differences. Ahead of the talks, Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu echoed the comments of his president but signalled a willingness to talk. ""A big majority of the Turkish people are against the membership of those countries who are supporting PKK terrorist organization ... but these are the issues that we need to talk of course with our NATO allies as well as these countries,"" AFP quoted him as saying. Nato, a Western military alliance, was founded in part to ward off threat from the Soviet Union in 1949. President Putin has mentioned Ukraine's intention to join the alliance as one of the reasons for the invasion of its neighbour. "

270,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-61422554,2022-05-14T07:24:04,The five-year-old Ukrainian learning to love Scotland," Five-year-old Oleksii, who now shares our Scottish house as part of the Homes for Ukraine scheme, refuses to speak Russian. His act of defiance began in Ukraine after he asked his mother: ""Why do so many people speak Russian if the Russians came to kill us?"" Before he arrived in Scotland a few weeks ago, Oleksii lived on the edge of Kyiv near the road that leads to Bucha. This was near where the column of Russian tanks lined up for an assault on the Ukrainian capital earlier in the war. His family could hear one explosion after the next and ""saw the sky turn purple"" so they fled to the west of the country in search of safety. I first met his mum Nataliia over a video call. I had been in touch with a contact I had filmed with for a Panorama programme in Ukraine many years earlier to ask if I could help. Her answer was Nataliia. On the video call, and with a family member translating, she seemed warm but pragmatic. I liked her. Soon after, we started the form-filling and the planning to bring her and Oleksii to Scotland. When the Russian soldiers withdrew from Kyiv, Nataliia and Oleksii moved back but they were not sure how long the calm would last. Her husband knew he had to stay behind regardless. In time, Nataliia forwarded the visa approval letter from the UK home secretary and they were finally able to get on their way. She booked flights from Poland but first, she had to get out of Ukraine. She sent me videos she had taken on her phone of their route. They were images I've seen on the news but ones a five-year-old should not have to see in real life. They travelled past the burnt-out tanks on the main road near their home, past people with guns and past the bombed maternity hospital. In contrast, we were sorting out the spare room, learning some basic Ukrainian and buying in Chicken Kyivs. My kids took it all on with the gusto of a school project, perhaps not stopping to calculate how it would change their lives. When the big day arrived I went to Glasgow airport and met a woman in Scotland I had contacted after Nataliia discovered she was a distant relative. Nataliia had been thinking back to how her grandmother told her that her two brothers became refugees in Scotland after World War Two. She started trying to trace their relatives and got a phone number for her long-lost cousin Jeanne. More than 70 years on from giving refuge to Nataliia's ancestors, Scotland was again providing refuge for a family separated by war. As we stood waiting at the airport, cast together by a woman none of us had ever met, I would have liked to get to know Jeanne better but we both had an eye on the arrivals area. Any mother and child that steps through from baggage collection made us pause, ""Is that them?"", then breathe out and pick up the conversation again mid-sentence. My phone rang. It's border patrol. They were checking we were genuine sponsors. It was quite a relief as I hadn't heard a peep from officialdom since I filled out the visa forms. ""Special Branch will want 10 minutes with them,"" they said. When they finally appeared around the corner, I realise how emotionally invested I was in them already. So was Jeanne and her family. While my kids had been painting welcome signs for them and putting out Lego for Oleksii, I had been doing the thinking, the worrying, the getting to know them and considering the impact on my own family. And so with that first hug at the airport, I cried through my smile. Nataliia had paid for one piece of luggage on the plane for the two of them. Just one bag to take them into the unknown, for who knows how long. I take more than that on a one-week holiday. I guess stuff has less value in wartime. Within 10 minutes of arriving, she opened the bag to offer presents: Ukrainian sweets, chocolates, mugs, honey. I kept thinking she could have brought another pair of shoes, maybe her favourite woolly hat and a photo album, if she hadn't been so thoughtful. In the car, we were eager to show off our country. She was on a translation app to work out what we were saying when she couldn't interpret our acting. When we showed them up to their room, she said in English: ""It's perfect"". It's not of course but it's light and airy and it's safe. Her brain must be exhaustively retrieving long-ago-learned vocabulary from a school textbook. My attempt to learn Ukrainian is in all honesty more of a gesture and an attempt at solidarity. Her attempts to improve her English are a necessity. But the first question to really fox me was: ""What horse stand up?"" We go back to the translation app which tells us she means: ""What time do you get up in the morning?"" And so the laughter begins. We went for a walk in the woods and Oleksii's face tells us everything. His body unfurls, his downcast eyes are now playful and he breathes in the freedom to explore. Nataliia explains that although the soldiers have left Kyiv, the children can't play in their parks or woods or school grounds because it is dangerous. There is unexploded ordnance all around them at home. By the afternoon, it's clear Nataliia wants to make herself useful. I find her cleaning our walls. And as we job-share in the kitchen we chat easily. Being forced to use simple language distils her experiences down to the bare truths, adding to their starkness. She talks of running to shelters at night, how associating bombs and air-raid sirens with night-time has made Oleksii afraid of the dark. How scary it was travelling under war-time conditions. I realise just how close they were to the fighting when she says: ""We were leaving to escape the first time on the very day the Russian troops were advancing. ""The sky was black. Tanks and artillery were on the edge of our village - that's where the Ukrainian troops stopped the aggression."" As we get to know each other I start to experience the war through her eyes. Not just seeing it on her social media, but feeling it. ""My husband has heard explosions today,"" she tells me as we put the knives and forks on the table. ""This bomb hit a tank manufacturer just 100 metres from my sister's home,"" she says as we chat by the sink. Her English vocabulary is expanding to include the glossary of war. Nataliia says: ""Before I didn't know what war was, when it was in Syria or Yemen it was somewhere else. Now I know war"". We go to have their identity verified for their visa with biometric data checks and it feels like this is the final stamp of becoming a refugee. Not a label she wears easily - certainly not one she had ever planned for in life. In Ukraine children don't start school until they are six so Oleksii's first ever day in class is in a foreign country where he can't understand his teacher or his classmates. He can count to 10 in English, knows some animals and the words to ""Rain, rain, go away, come back again another day"". ""Oleskii is nervous,"" Nataliia says. ""He is scared."" We teach him how to ask to go to the toilet and how to pronounce his teacher's name before we arrive at the school gate. It seems fear of separation has become entrenched since the war started, for Nataliia too. ""I am scared because I won't be near him,"" she tells me. At lunchtime we go to get Oleksii and Nataliia finds out he has been crying. He wanted to ask if his mother would ever return to get him? It's an important question but he didn't have the words to say it. I ask him if school has been good: ""Dobre?"" ""Ni,"" he says. No. All this with his father inhabiting his son's life through video calls, from inside a country at war. He can't be there for his son's first day at school. After day four, I ask about school again and I get a reply of ""dobre"" and a gentle smile. I don't hold back my smile. Nataliia's is unmissable. I hear about a wee boy who goes up to Oleksii in the playground and says: ""Hello, we have the same shoes"". Oleksii doesn't understand. But maybe he does understand that it's an offer of friendship. Jeanne is also enjoying getting to know her newfound family. ""Nataliia is very like what my grandmother looked like,"" she says. ""I always felt a great loss not knowing my Ukrainian side of the family so I feel I've been given a wee bit of that back. ""In my heart, family comes first so we are so thankful that Natalia is here with Oleksii and we can be here for her."" And so, back at home, we settle in to a pattern of eating dinner together in the evenings and then maybe going out to play with Oleksii for a bit. We are thankful for the international joy of hide and seek. We meet other Ukrainians, we do the admin of refugee life and Nataliia cooks us dumplings and borscht. ""I love Tesco,"" she says. For us, and for Nataliia and Oleksii, this is how life begins as a refugee. "

But what are Russia's intelligence services suspected of doing and how will their officials' expulsion from capitals affect Putin's clandestine overseas operations? When Russia first targeted its military forces on Ukraine in 2014 it also unleashed its intelligence services on the West - from interfering with the US elections using cyber attacks to poisonings and sabotage in Europe. But in recent months the spy war has intensified as Western countries have sought to hit back and inflict lasting damage on the ability of Russian intelligence to carry out covert operations. This is symbolised by the unprecedented expulsion of 500 Russian officials from Western capitals. Formally, these officials are described as diplomats, but the majority are believed to be undercover intelligence officers. Some will have been carrying out traditional espionage - cultivating contacts and recruiting agents who can pass on secrets - something Western countries do inside Russia too. But some were believed to be carrying out what Russians call ""active measures"". These range from spreading propaganda, to more aggressive covert activity. Poland said the 45 Russians it expelled were involved in actions to ""undermine the stability"" of the country. Since 2014, Western intelligence agencies have been working to identify Russian spies involved in such activities. One of those is GRU Unit 29155 of Russian military intelligence, which is believed to be tasked with sabotage, subversion and assassination. It took nearly seven years to find out the unit were behind a huge explosion that tore apart an ammunition depot in a Czech forest in October 2014. They included some of those later involved in the UK's Salisbury poisonings of 2018. The same team also tried to poison an arms dealer in Bulgaria who had stored weapons in the Czech depot - one theory was that the blast and poisoning was linked to his supply of weapons for Ukraine where the conflict had just begun. Members of that unit were also involved in getting pro-Russian leaders out of Ukraine in 2014. It remains closely watched by Western intelligence. But man-marking individual spies is expensive work. While Western spies in Russia have long been subject to round-the-clock surveillance, their Russian counterparts in Western capitals have not. ""The larger the presence is, the more difficult it is to keep a lid on exactly what they are up to,"" one US official told the BBC. But this may now be changing. Western officials say the recent expulsions are more than a symbolic gesture of protest but part of the wider push to degrade Russia's capacity to do harm. Some spy-catchers also say the mass expulsion is long overdue. The Russians have been laughing at us for our tolerance of their presence, says one official. ""We are trying to inflict a cost on Russia to reduce its offensive capabilities and its ability to project threat against its neighbours and the West,"" one official says. ""A number of European nations have taken action to reduce the Russian intelligence service capability across Europe. All of these are steps designed to reduce its threats to us."" Some countries are believed to have had a particularly significant presence. Berlin expelled 40 Russians. However, a Western intelligence official said they believed Germany had previously housed closer to 100 Russian intelligence officers, acting like an ""aircraft carrier"" for their operations. Why has the UK not expelled anyone? Officials say all of them were kicked out after Salisbury and the only spies left are ""declared"" officers who act as liaisons for formal contacts. They are likely to be watched by MI5 for any sign they are carrying out any covert acts on the side. In the US, expulsions are based on investigations into each individual. ""All the determinations on who to expel are based on intelligence collected by the FBI based on what they are doing,"" explains a US official. Western countries have been co-operating to ensure anyone expelled cannot simply apply for a visa in another country. Security officials say they believe the volume of expulsions over a short period will have a ""debilitating"" impact on Russian intelligence as it scrambles to work out how operations can be continued and who can be placed where. Russia has retaliated by expelling Western diplomats. In practice, more of these are likely to be ""real"" diplomats rather than spies. One of the complaints from Western security services has long been the imbalance in the number of Russian diplomats in Western countries, and the proportion who are spies compared to those from the West serving in Moscow. Russia expelled 40 Germans but that makes up around a third of the entire diplomatic presence in its capital. The invasion of Ukraine may offer other opportunities. Past events like the crushing of the Prague Spring by Moscow in 1968 caused disillusionment among some within the secret state in Moscow, opening the way for their recruitment as Western agents. In Washington DC, the FBI has targeted online advertisements to people in close proximity to the Russian Embassy, according to a Washington Post report. They encouraged them to talk to the FBI, using footage of Vladimir Putin publicly embarrassing the head of Russia's foreign intelligence agency, the SVR. Since 2014, Ukraine has also been the epicentre for a more brutal covert struggle, with each side trying to recruit and root-out spies but also with assassinations of high-ranking Ukrainian officials. Western intelligence agencies and special forces have also been training Ukrainian counterparts for years, alongside more overt military assistance. They have helped catch Russian spies and offered training in covert action, including by the CIA's Ground Branch. The spy battles could still escalate, particularly as covert activity presents one option for Moscow to target supply lines bringing in military aid for Ukraine. A missile strike on convoys or facilities in Poland would be highly risky as it could trigger NATO's Article 5 self-defence principle leading to all-out conflict. But Western intelligence officials say they have concerns that the kind of sabotage operation seen in the Czech Republic in 2014 could be attempted in Poland given its key role as a staging post for supplies going into Ukraine. These type of clandestine operations are often carried out by Russians who travel in and out of a country rather than diplomats. But embassies provide the enabling infrastructure for their activities to take place, one Western intelligence official explains. And the hope will be that the large-scale expulsions will make that, as well as traditional spying, much harder now, not least because there will be fewer spies to keep tabs on. "

The company said it had not been paid for previous deliveries. The Finnish grid operator said Russia provided only a small percentage of the country's electricity and that it could be replaced from alternative sources. On Thursday, Russia threatened to take ""retaliatory steps"" after Finland said it planned to join Nato. Finland shares a 1,300-km (810-mile) border with Russia, and has previously stayed out of Nato to avoid antagonising its eastern neighbour. However, since Russia's invasion of Ukraine there has been a surge in public support for Nato membership. On Sunday Finland is expected to formally announce its plan to join. The decision by Rao Nordic has not been explicitly tied to Finland's decision. The Russian state-owned firm said: ""This situation is exceptional and happened for the first time in over twenty years of our trading history"". Neither Rao Nordic nor the grid operator in Finland, Fingrid, explained what was behind the payment difficulties. Last month Russia cut supplies of gas to Bulgaria and Poland after they refused to comply with a demand to pay in roubles, a change they said would contravene western sanctions. This week Russia's Gazprom announced it would stop supplying gas via the Polish part of the Yamal-Europe pipeline. Fingrid said it did not expect electricity shortages as a result of the shut off, as only around 10% of Finland's electricity is supplied from Russia. ""The lack of electricity import from Russia will be compensated by importing more electricity from Sweden and by generating more electricity in Finland,"" said Reima Päivinen, senior vice president of power system operations at Fingrid. Demand is also decreasing as the weather gets warmer, while a significant amount of extra wind power generation is expected to come on stream. A new nuclear power station, expected to open this summer, would more than make up for the lost supplies from Russia, Fingrid added. "

Russian forces were accused by Ukrainian MPs of completely destroying more than 100 healthcare facilities since the invasion started on 24 February. British military intelligence said a single Russian battalion had recently lost almost all of its armoured vehicles during a failed attempt to cross a river in the eastern war zone. Aerial images showed dozens of burnt-out tanks and the remains of a pontoon bridge. BBC News Russian has been able to verify the deaths of 2,336 Russian service personnel since the start of the invasion. Moscow's forces made gains elsewhere, reportedly taking the strategically important town of Rubizne. In Kyiv, Ukraine started its first war crimes trial since the beginning of the invasion, putting a 21-year-old Russian soldier in the dock and accusing him of killing an unarmed civilian. Western sanctions on Russia got more personal when the UK placed travel bans and asset freezes on Russian President Vladimir Putin's former wife, Lyudmila Ocheretnaya, and his alleged current girlfriend, Alina Kabaeva. And a Russian energy supplier said it would suspend deliveries of electricity to Finland from Saturday, one day after the Finnish president said he supported an application for Nato membership. An estimated 14 million Ukrainians have fled their homes since the invasion started. One of the six million or so who moved abroad is nine-year-old Marharyta, who spoke no English when she first arrived in the UK from her home city of Lviv. She and her mum Larysa moved to Manchester after securing visas through the Ukraine Family Scheme, and now she is happily learning the new language. The UK government has plans to enrol up to 100,000 Ukrainian children who have fled the war. The National Association of Head Teachers is calling for urgent counselling support and access to specialist language tuition. India has not joined in the international condemnation of Russia's invasion, making clear it does not want to take sides. However, some defence experts believe it may find it has little choice other than to lessen its dependence on Russian military equipment, given the impact of Western sanctions. In the last decade, it has bought more equipment from other countries - noticeably from France, but also from Israel and the US and, to a lesser extent, the UK. But Sangeeta Saxena, editor of Delhi-based Aviation and Defence Universe, says the Indian army will keep buying from Russia - not just because its personnel are familiar with the equipment, but also because the relationship with Russia has withstood the test of time. The invasion has tightened global supplies of the metal, pushing up the price, which had already climbed during the coronavirus pandemic. ""A lot of buyers of aluminium in Europe are almost self-sanctioning and refusing to touch Russian aluminium if they can,"" says Uday Patel, senior research manager at consultancy Wood Mackenzie. The metal is used in a bewildering variety of products, from door frames to aircraft, and some believe supply constraints are likely to continue for some time. Read on.

274,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-61417928,2022-05-13T19:20:47,Brittney Griner: US basketball star has Russian detention extended," The American basketball star Brittney Griner's pre-trial detention in Russia has been extended for one month. Ms Griner, 31, has been in custody since February after Moscow airport officials allegedly found cannabis oil in her luggage, while she was returning to the US after playing in Russia. US officials said she was wrongfully imprisoned and should be released. Ms Griner - regarded as one of the world's best female players - faces up to 10 years in prison if convicted. An Associated Press photograph shows Ms Griner wearing an orange hoodie and looking down at the court hearing, held in the city of Khimki just outside Moscow. The US State Department said a consular official attended the hearing, and spoke to Ms Griner on the margins. A spokesman said Ms Griner was doing ""as well as can be expected during exceedingly difficult circumstances"". Following the hearing, her lawyer told AP that Ms Griner hadn't conveyed ""any complaints about the detention conditions"". Citing unnamed government officials, state-owned Russian news agency TASS is reporting that Russia hopes to trade Ms Griner for Viktor Bout, an arms trafficker convicted in the US. Popularly known as ""the Merchant of Death"", Bout was arrested in Thailand in 2008 and extradited to the US, where he was convicted of intending to smuggle weapons to rebels in Colombia to be used against US citizens. He was sentenced to 25 years in prison in New York in April 2012. Russian authorities have claimed that a sniffer dog led authorities to search Ms Griner's carry-on luggage, leading them to vape cartridges containing hashish oil. While the incident took place on 17 February, Russian officials only confirmed her detention in the second week of March. Her detention came as US and Women's National Basketball Association officials urged Americans to leave Russia amid rising tensions over Ukraine, which Russia invaded on 24 February. Since then, US and WNBA officials have seemingly made little headway in their efforts to secure her release. In a statement after Friday's hearing, the WNBA said that the extension of her detention ""was not unexpected"" and that the league was still working with the US government to get her released. Despite deteriorating relations between the US and Russia, officials have kept diplomatic channels open for negotiations. Last month, a US citizen and former Marine, Trevor Reed, was released from prison in Russia, where he was serving a nine-year sentence for assault. In exchange, the US released Konstantin Yorashenko, a Russian pilot who had been sentenced to 20 years in prison for drug trafficking. Ms Griner's case is reportedly now being handled by a special State Department section, the Office of the Special Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs, which specialises in helping secure the release of Americans held hostage or wrongfully detained abroad.

275,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-61438809,2022-05-13T16:59:54,What's happening in Parliament this week?," The twin themes of domestic and international crisis run through events in Parliament next week. Perhaps because most of the key people who would have wanted to speak were not in Westminster on Thursday, MPs didn't get a chance to discuss the UK's new defence pact with Finland and Sweden last week. So expect a statement from Boris Johnson on Monday, and a longer chance to mull over the war in Ukraine in a debate on NATO and international security - again led by the PM - on Thursday. The Foreign Affairs Committee will also have a chance to quiz Foreign Secretary Liz Truss on Wednesday, in a session which will look at the impact of the Ukraine conflict on the aid budget. Then there's the continuing the government's release of the security advice the prime minister received before giving a peerage to Lord Lebedev Labour complained that the documents eventually published in response to a Commons motion were ""so heavily redacted, it is utterly pointless"". Expect more points of order and possibly other consequences (raising the issue as a contempt of Parliament, perhaps?), including a ruling from the Speaker on whether the matter should be debated in the Commons. And of course there's the ongoing saga of Covid lockdown breaches - confirmed and alleged. Next week's formal agenda is dominated by the continuing debate on the Queen's Speech, the government's new programme of legislation. These will focus on the themes: ""Making Britain the best place in the world to grow up and grow old"" (Monday); ""Tackling short-term and long-term cost of living increases"" (Tuesday); and ""Achieving economic growth"" (Wednesday). The Opposition parties will put down amendments to what is, formally, a debate on an address thanking Her Majesty for the Queen's Speech (known in parliamentary jargon as the ""gracious speech""). Labour get two amendments and the SNP one - while smaller parties like the Lib Dems can put down amendments, but won't get them debated. The Lib Dems are planning something on the problems of rural areas, which is of course entirely unconnected to the forthcoming Tiverton and Honiton by-election. A parallel series of debates will take place in the Lords, with peers discussing the economy, energy and the environment on Monday; education, welfare, health and public services on Tuesday; and foreign affairs, defence and trade on Wednesday. Listen out for the sound of markers thudding down as they signal where they might seek to rewrite the government's legislation. One lesson of the last session of Parliament was that ministers have lost control of a key stage of law-making, with cross-party alliances of peers defeating the government again and again on amendments during the Lords' detailed report stage considerations. Most of these defeats were eventually reversed in the Commons - and the government will seek revenge for its most spectacular loss, when peers voted down an attempt to add new public order powers to the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill, by trying to push through the same powers in a free-standing Public Order Bill. Peers have yet to see the details of many of the promised bills, but there will certainly be plenty of issues where more of these cross-party alliances may be mustered, particularly on human rights and giving ministers sweeping powers to rewrite laws inherited from the EU. Even if Their Lordships don't start firing back dozens of unwelcome amendments, delivering the government's programme inside a normal 12-month or so parliamentary session looks extremely demanding, with a whopping 38 bills to be processed. That compares with 30 in the two-year session which began in 2017, and 42 in the two-year session which opened the Coalition years. It may mean MPs face an extra-long parliamentary session, but some observers speculate that the government might be prepared to ditch much of its programme and call a snap election. Remember they've legislated to return that option to the prime minister. In any event the Queen's Speech is about laws, and most possible solutions - or at least palliatives - for the cost of living crisis revolve around taxes and government spending. It's suggested the Chancellor will have something to offer in the summer. With Rishi Sunak due to face Commons questions on Tuesday, expect plenty of probing from all sides, with a chance to follow up his answers in the ensuing segment of the Queen's Speech debate, on the cost of living crisis. There are other plotlines as well. The annual Private Members' Bill ballot takes place on Thursday - giving a random collection of backbenchers some level of debating priority on legislation of their choice, in Friday sittings of the Commons. Much depends on who wins. Some MPs are happy to put their name to ""handout bills"" from the government, enacting some useful change that didn't make the cut in the official programme of legislation. Others may go for a declaratory bill that dramatises a cause, but which the government will organise to block. A good example might be a new incarnation of the Climate Emergency Bill, backed by major green pressure groups. Watch this space. Wednesday will also see an election to replace the departed Neil Parish as Chair of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee. All MPs have a vote, but the candidates must be Conservatives, because the carve-up agreed with the Opposition allocates this committee chair to the Tories. The Speaker will announce the result in the chamber later that day. Nominations close on Tuesday, and the rumour mill has quite a number of potential candidates: in no particular order, Sir Geoffrey Clifton Brown, Sir Robert Goodwill, Neil Hudson, Robbie Moore, Fay Jones and Anthony Mangnall - all strenuously seeking to avoid the kiss of death label of being the government's preferred candidate, which guarantees that they would get no votes from Opposition MPs. Meanwhile, Ian Mearns, Chair of the Backbench Business Committee (a post which must go to an Opposition MP) is up for mid-term re-election. Usually there's no challenger, but watch that space. Monday will see the Treasury Committee questioning Governor of the Bank of England, Andrew Bailey, as inflation soars towards 10 per cent. The next day, 'The Only Way Is Essex' star Charlie King will talk about cosmetic procedures and the pressures of working in the fitness industry, in the final session of Health and Social Care's inquiry into the impact of body image on mental and physical health. He'll be followed by Minister for Mental Health Gillian Keegan. On Thursday, Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Secretary, Nadine Dorries appears before the DCMS Committee to discuss the Online Safety Bill, the futures of the BBC and Channel 4, and the impact of Covid and Brexit on the cultural sector.

Vadim Shishimarin appeared at a preliminary hearing in Kyiv. He faces life in prison if convicted. Ukraine says it has identified thousands of potential war crimes committed by Russia. Russia has denied targeting civilians and made no comment on the trial. Prosecutors say Mr Shishimarin was driving in a stolen vehicle with other soldiers in the north-eastern Sumy region when they encountered a 62-year-old cyclist using a phone. He was ordered to shoot the civilian to stop them from telling Ukrainian defenders about their location, according to the prosecutors. It is not clear how he was captured or what the nature of the evidence against him is. Mr Shishimarin spoke to confirm basic details such as his name. He is yet to enter a plea, and the trial will reconvene next week. Hundreds of bodies have been found in regions previously occupied by Russia. Some of Ukraine's allies, such as the UK and US, have joined the country in accusing Russia of carrying out genocide. After the hearing, state prosecutor Andriy Synyuk told Reuters: ""This is the first case today. But soon there will be a lot of these cases."" "

Alison Bird put the family of four up in her caravan in Dovercourt, Essex, despite the local authorities rejecting her application. She said she had been too far along the process to tell the family she could not host them. The local authorities said they would be making contact with her and would look at rematching the family. Ms Bird had argued the heated, fully furnished caravan, on a caravan site, was ""perfectly suitable"". But her application was rejected by Essex County Council and the other local organisations involved in the Homes for Ukraine scheme due to the seasonal nature of caravans and restrictions on year-round occupancy. Ms Bird said she went ahead ""in spite of the barriers put in the way by the local authorities"" and the family arrived on 29 April. ""We were already six weeks down the line and couldn't turn around to the family and say 'you've got to start the process again and we can't have you',"" she said. She said she was told they would not receive any funding from the Homes for Ukraine scheme and they have tried to fundraise in other ways. A spokesperson for the Essex authorities thanked the family for ""kindly stepping up and offering their support"", but added that the ""static caravan site in question is not open all year round, the accommodation has been deemed unsuitable"". They said payments under the Homes for Ukraine scheme were ""not issued if any of the housing or safeguarding checks are failed"". ""We will be speaking to the Bird family again regarding the current situation and the rematching process,"" they added. Find BBC News: East of England on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

Lyudmila Ocheretnaya, who was married to the president until 2014, and former Olympic gymnast Alina Kabaeva, face UK travel bans and asset freezes. The UK has now placed more than 1,000 people on its Russian sanctions list. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said Britain was ""tightening the vice"" on Mr Putin's ""inner circle"". The UK was ""exposing and targeting the shady network propping up Putin's luxury lifestyle"", she said, and would ""keep going with sanctions on all those aiding and abetting Putin's aggression until Ukraine prevails"". Ms Truss said sanctions against Russia should only be lifted when all of its troops had left Ukraine. Earlier, she told a meeting of G7 foreign ministers in Germany that allies should go ""further and faster"" in supporting Ukraine's resistance. She said President Putin must face a defeat that prevents further aggression - but some analysts have warned this stance may make a political settlement harder. Earlier this month it was reported that the EU planned to sanction more Russian individuals, including Ms Kabaeva. Since Russia invaded Ukraine on 24 February, thousands of civilians and combatants have been killed or injured, and some 14 million people have fled their homes, with more than six million seeking refuge abroad. Since her divorce, Lyudmila Ocheretnaya has benefited from preferential business relationships with state-owned entities and exhibited significant unexplained wealth, the UK Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) says. She is a close associate of Mr Putin and obtains a financial or material benefit from this association, it adds. Ms Kabaeva is a former Russian MP and chair of the board of directors of the National Media Group, which is reportedly the largest private Russian media company, the FCDO says. It notes that the National Media Group controls television stations including Channel One, which is already under sanctions. ""She is also rumoured to be the current partner of Putin and it is reported that he has tried to reduce her visibility since the invasion began,"" the FCDO says. ""For example, a couple of weeks after the invasion, the National Media Group website was updated to remove her name, along with any reference to the board of directors."" Russia's leader has explicitly denied having a relationship with Ms Kabaeva. Among others added to the UK sanctions list are Ms Kabaeva's grandmother, Anna Zatseplina, and cousins of Mr Putin. An asset freeze prevents any UK citizen, or any business in the UK, from dealing with any funds or economic resources which are owned, held or controlled by the designated person. A travel ban means the designated person must be refused leave to enter or to remain in the UK. The UK foreign secretary has been among the most outspoken of UK ministers in setting out explicit aims relating to the conflict, saying in a speech last month that Russia should be pushed out of ""the whole of Ukraine"". Some foreign policy analysts have raised concerns that such specific demands might one day clash with Ukraine's interests and could make negotiations harder. Ukrainian and Moldovan foreign ministers are expected to join G7 ministers at another meeting in Germany on Friday. On Saturday, Ms Truss is due to travel to Berlin for a meeting of Nato foreign ministers, where the FCDO says she will push for a ""strengthened and modernised"" version of the western alliance. "

A foreign ministry statement said the move would seriously damage bilateral relations, as well as security and stability in northern Europe. Earlier, Finland's president and PM called for the country to apply for Nato membership ""without delay"". It comes amid a surge in public support for Nato membership following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Finland shares a 1,300-km (810-mile) border with Russia. Until now, it has stayed out of Nato to avoid antagonising its eastern neighbour. Finland will formally announce its decision on Sunday after it has been considered by parliament and other senior political figures. Sweden has said it will announce a similar decision on the same day. Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg has said he expects the process of giving Sweden and Finland membership to happen ""quite quickly"". The White House said the US would back a Nato application from both countries if they apply. The Russian statement (in Russian) described Finland's move as ""a radical change in the country's foreign policy"". ""Finland's accession to Nato will cause serious damage to bilateral Russian-Finnish relations and the maintaining of stability and security in the Northern European region,"" it said. ""Russia will be forced to take retaliatory steps, both of a military-technical and other nature, in order to neutralise the threats to its national security that arise from this."" However, Moscow has not specified what steps it plans to take. Russia's deputy UN representative Dmitry Polyansky said Sweden and Finland would become possible targets for Russia if they become Nato members, according to Russian news agency Ria. Russian officials were responding to a joint statement by Finnish President Sauli Niinisto and Prime Minister Sanna Marin, which said the two leaders expected a decision on Nato membership in the next few days. ""Nato membership would strengthen Finland's security,"" it said. ""As a member of Nato, Finland would strengthen the entire defence alliance. Finland must apply for Nato membership without delay."" Speaking to journalists later, Mr Niinisto responded to Russian concerns and blamed the move on Moscow's invasion. ""Joining Nato would not be against anyone. You caused this. Look in the mirror,"" he said. An opinion poll last week put support in Finland for joining Nato at 76%, with 12% against, a big swing towards membership since before the invasion. Finland and the USSR were on opposing sides in World War Two, with the Finns famously fending off a Soviet invasion in 1939-40. But Finland lost 10% of its territory in the final peace agreement and remained non-aligned throughout the Cold War. Its accession to Nato would more than double the length of Russia's borders with the alliance. Sweden does not have a border with Russia. "

But some foreign policy analysts fear that such specific demands might one day clash with Ukraine's interests and could make negotiations harder. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has also warned against the ""renormalisation"" of relations with Russia, saying it would risk repeating the world's errors over Moscow's annexation of Crimea in 2014 - the precursor to its full invasion of Ukraine earlier this year. In the meeting with other foreign ministers from wealthy nations, Ms Truss also repeated calls to increase support for the defence of Ukraine, including increased access to military equipment used by the Nato military alliance. She said: ""The best long-term security for Ukraine will come from it being able to defend itself. That means providing Ukraine with a clear pathway to Nato-standard equipment."" Ukrainian and Moldovan foreign ministers are expected to join the G7 ministers at another meeting in Germany on Friday. Then on Saturday, Ms Truss is due to travel to Berlin for a meeting of Nato foreign ministers, where the Foreign Office said she will push for a ""strengthened and modernised"" version of the Western alliance. It comes after Finland's leaders announced they supported the country joining Nato. Less than 24 hours earlier, Finland and its neighbour Sweden also signed a defence pact with the UK, which could see British troops sent to the Nordic nations in the event of a Russian invasion. Both countries had previously chosen to stay neutral to avoid antagonising Russia, which shares a 830-mile border with Finland. "

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said during a visit to the US in April that India would like to be a ""good friend"" to Western countries. But she added that India didn't want to be weakened, and needed to ensure its security - taken to mean its long-standing reliance on Russian military equipment - would continue. India is one of the world's largest buyers of weapons, and had a close defence relationship with the former Soviet Union for many years. India's rivalry with Pakistan, and increasingly with China, means Russia has remained a key partner for Delhi, even after the collapse of the Soviet Union in the 1990s. Since 1992, about two-thirds of Indian military equipment has come from Russia, according to Sipri (the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute), which tracks global arms transfers and military expenditure. The Stimson Center, a US-based research group, estimates that Russian weaponry could account for as much as 85% of major Indian weapons systems. This includes fighter jets, nuclear-powered submarines, aircraft carriers, tanks and missiles. In the last decade, its reliance on Russian weapons has reduced and it has bought more equipment from other countries - noticeably from France, but also from Israel and the US and, to a lesser extent, the UK. Figures from Sipri show that the value of arms sales by France, the US and Israel to India in 2021 were double what they were in 2017, although Russia remains a major supplier. India has bought Rafale jets, Mirage combat aircraft and Scorpene submarines from France. During a recent visit there by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, both countries said they had agreed to deepen their co-operation in advanced defence technology. Similarly, during a trip to Delhi in April by UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, the UK and India pledged to deepen defence and security ties, highlighting joint collaboration in advanced jet fighter technology. India has also turned to Israel for some of its high-tech defence and security needs, including: And India's military ties with the US have been growing strongly, with defence trade between them rising considerably from 2018 to 2019. Major purchases include US long-range maritime patrol aircraft and C-130 transport aircraft, as well as missiles and drones, and a recent Pentagon statement spoke of ""deepening co-operation"" in space defence and cyber-security. Changing international politics in recent years means India's ties with countries such as France, the US and Israel have become closer. Despite that, India has not joined in the international condemnation of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, making clear it doesn't want to take sides. Some defence experts believe that India may find it has little choice other than to lessen its dependence on Moscow, given the impact of sanctions on Russia. Sameer Lalwani, a defence and security analyst at the Stimson Center, says there could now be issues with key components for the Russian S-400 surface-to-air missile system, which India bought in 2018, only part of which has been delivered. ""There's strong reason to believe that... Russia will be unable to fulfil its contractual commitments to India with delivery of all of the S-400 system,"" says Mr Lalwani. He also believes that the losses Russia has incurred in Ukraine could mean it may not be able to meet India's needs ""because it will be desperate to use all the spares to replenish its own forces"". And he says Indian policymakers may be taking note of some of the issues that have faced Russian battlefield equipment in Ukraine. That looks unlikely at the moment. A US Congressional report in October last year said that the ""Indian military cannot operate effectively without Russian-supplied equipment and will continue to rely on Russian weapons systems in the near and middle term"". The report noted that Russia offers its weapons at relatively attractive prices. Sangeeta Saxena, editor of Delhi-based Aviation and Defence Universe, says the Indian army in particular will continue to keep buying from Russia. She says it's not just the fact its personnel are familiar with their equipment, but also that the relationship with Russia has withstood the test of time. But she adds that India wants to develop its homegrown defence industry, sometimes in joint partnerships with other countries. This involves using state-of-the-art technology from abroad to give a major push to arms manufacturing under programmes such as ""Make in India"", explains Ms Saxena. India will buy from whoever it thinks offers the most suitable or best-value deal - be it Russia or other countries, she explains. Read more from Reality Check Send us your questions "

But for many, staying means a daily battle for survival. Russia has kept up its bombing and shelling in the east of Ukraine, as well as further north, close to the country's second largest city, Kharkiv. There are also skirmishes to control the small Snake Island - a strategic outpost which would enable the Russians to command areas to the south of Ukraine, but also near Nato member Romania. And as if this was not enough, horrendous tales of violence keep emerging. The BBC has pieced together events around the shooting by Russian soldiers of two unarmed civilians during the fighting outside Kyiv. The footage is now being investigated by the Ukrainian prosecutor's office for possible war crimes, one of more than 10,000 cases they have registered. The daughter of one of the men, Yulia Androshchuk, said she was full of grief and fear following her father's death. ""My Dad was not a military man at all. He was a pensioner. They killed a 65-year-old. What for?"" she said. Our Eastern Europe correspondent Sarah Rainsford tells the whole story. The UN Human Rights Council has now added its weight behind international efforts to investigate violations in Ukraine. At an emergency session in Geneva, Ukraine's Deputy Foreign Minister Emine Dzhaparova said the people of her country had faced ""10 weeks of sheer horror"". ""Torture and enforced disappearances, sexual and gender-based violence - the list of Russia's crimes is endless,"" she said. The UN General Assembly voted in April to suspend Russia from the Council and it immediately withdrew. It could have attended this session as an observer, but its chair was empty. It is not clear whether they will investigate the case described by Sarah Rainsford above. Russia continued to deny its troops commit atrocities - insisting Ukrainian Nazis are behind them. But for many in the West, the conflict has underlined the need to boost defences against an unpredictable Russia. Neighbouring Finland's leaders have called for the country to apply for Nato membership ""without delay"". Russia and Finland share a 1,300km (810-mile) border. Finland has been non-aligned since World War Two and has always sought not to antagonise its eastern neighbour. Russia said it would retaliate, without specifying what measures would be taken. The BBC's Phelan Chatterjee looks at the issues behind the moves by Finland and neighbouring Sweden. Finland's move towards Nato may well be coloured by its experiences in World War Two, when it fought against the then Soviet Union. In what became known as the Winter War of 1939-40, Finland repelled a Soviet invasion, but as an ally of Nazi Germany ended up ceding most of its eastern province of Karelia. Anna-Liisa Anttila was a teenager in the city of Vyborg at the time. The Soviets captured it and made it part of Russia, and Finland never got it back. She remembers what the bombing was like back then and tells the BBC's Allan Little about having to flee with her mother on the last bus out of town. The move comes a day after UK PM Boris Johnson agreed mutual security pacts with Sweden and Finland. For Mr Johnson, relations with Mr Putin's Russia are unlikely to return to normal. In an interview for LBC radio, he said: ""Nothing is impossible, I suppose - but I just cannot see for the life of me how we can renormalise relations with Putin now. ""He has grossly violated human rights, international law; he's guilty of absolutely barbaric onslaught on a totally innocent country."" The prime minister warned against making the same kind of mistakes as in 2014, when the West continued to negotiate with Mr Putin despite his annexation of Crimea. Here's the full story. And amidst the conflict and heightened political rhetoric, businesses have pulled out of Russia en masse. Among the first was energy giant Shell, which has agreed to sell more than 400 of its petrol stations in Russia to the country's second largest oil producer, Lukoil. Shell Neft, the firm's subsidiary in Russia, will be sold for an undisclosed sum. The firm said pulling out of Russian deals which include the sale of its stakes in all joint business ventures with Russian state energy firm Gazprom, had cost it $3.9bn (£3.1bn), though it has made profits of $9.13bn in the first three months of this year. Separately German electronic giant Siemens and Finnish utility company Fortum have said they will cease all business activities in Russia. Details of the move from Shell here. "
286,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-61397478,2022-05-12T15:35:09,Are Sweden and Finland going from neutral to Nato?," Finland has made its first move towards joining Nato, and Sweden could follow within days - a monumental shift for two nations with a long history of wartime neutrality and staying out of military alliances. Russia strongly opposes the two states joining and uses the expansion of the West's defensive military alliance as a pretext for its war in Ukraine. If they do, it will end over 200 years of Swedish non-alignment. Finland adopted neutrality following a bitter defeat by the Soviet Union during World War Two. Finnish public support for joining Nato was for years at around 20-25%. But since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, it has shot up to a record high of 76%, according to the latest opinion poll. In Sweden, 57% of the population want to join, again far higher than before the war. On Thursday, Finnish President Sauli Niinisto urged his country to apply for Nato membership ""without delay"", with the wider government expected to formally announce its decision on Sunday. Sweden's ruling party, too, is expected to deliver a verdict at the weekend. If it is a yes, both parliaments will have clear majorities in favour of membership, and the application process can begin. While the Finnish Social Democrats are likely to be in favour, Sweden's Social Democrats have been split on the issue, and are currently holding an internal consultation. However party Nato-sceptics appear to be leaning towards joining. ""Everything appears to be going in that direction,"" says ex-Foreign Minister Margot Wallstrom. The US says it is confident it can address any security concerns either country might have in the period between applying and formally becoming members. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson visited both countries on Wednesday to discuss their ""broader security issues"". That resulted in a new agreement to come to each other's aid if attacked, potentially allaying some fears. Vladimir Putin's actions have shattered a long-standing sense of stability in northern Europe, leaving Sweden and Finland feeling vulnerable. Finnish ex-Prime Minister Alexander Stubb says joining the alliance was a ""done deal"" for his country as soon as Russian troops invaded Ukraine on 24 February. Swedish Defence Minister Peter Hultqvist describes that day as the moment the Russian leader proved he was ""unpredictable, unreliable and prepared to wage a cruel, bloody and brutal war"". After promising Sweden would never join Nato last November, he now talks of the Nordic region's defences being strengthened if both countries sign up. Ultimately, many Finns and Swedes are looking to Nato in the belief it will keep them safe in an uncertain Europe. For Finns, events in Ukraine bring a haunting sense of familiarity. The Soviets invaded Finland in late 1939. For more than three months the Finnish army put up fierce resistance, despite being heavily outnumbered. They avoided occupation, but ended up losing 10% of their territory. Watching the war in Ukraine unfold is like reliving this history, says Iro Sarkka, a political scientist at the University of Helsinki. Finns are looking at their 1,340km (830 mile) border with Russia, she says, and thinking: ""Could this happen to us?"" Sweden has also felt endangered in recent years, with several reported airspace violations by Russian military aircraft. In 2014, Swedes were transfixed by reports that a Russian submarine was lurking in the shallow waters of the Stockholm archipelago. Two years later Sweden's army returned to the small but strategically important Baltic Sea island of Gotland, after abandoning it for two decades. In some ways, not much. Sweden and Finland became official partners of Nato in 1994 and have since become major contributors to the alliance. They have taken part in several Nato missions since the end of the Cold War. A major change would be the application of Nato's ""Article 5"", which views an attack on one member state as an attack on all. For the first time, Finland and Sweden would have security guarantees from nuclear states. Although the debate has shifted in favour of membership very quickly in both countries, historian Henrik Meinander argues Finland was mentally prepared for it. Small steps towards Nato have progressively been taken since the fall of the Soviet Union, he says. In 1992, Helsinki bought 64 US combat planes. Three years later, it joined the European Union, alongside Sweden. Every Finnish government since then has reviewed the so-called Nato option, he says. The army, which serves a population of 5.5 million, has a wartime strength of 280,000 soldiers, and in total 900,000 reservists. Sweden took a different path in the 1990s, reducing the size of its military and changing priorities from territorial defence to peacekeeping missions around the world. But that all changed in 2014, when Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine. Conscription returned and defence spending was boosted. In 2018, every household received army pamphlets titled ""if crisis or war comes"" - the first time they were sent out since 1991. Finland has already reached Nato's agreed defence spending target of 2% of GDP, and Sweden has drawn up plans to do so. President Putin has frequently used the prospect of Nato expanding to Ukraine to justify his invasion. So Sweden and Finland joining the alliance would be perceived as a provocation. Russia's foreign ministry says both countries have been warned of the ""consequences"" of such a move. Dmitry Medvedev, a close ally of the Russian leader, has warned that Nato accession may prompt Moscow to deploy nuclear weapons in Kaliningrad, the Russian exclave between Poland and Lithuania. While not dismissing these threats, Alexander Stubb suggests a more realistic risk is of Russian cyber attacks, disinformation campaigns and occasional airspace violations. There is a significant minority, at least in Sweden, who believe it would not. Deborah Solomon, from the Swedish Peace and Arbitration Society, argues that Nato's nuclear deterrence increases tensions and risks an arms race with Russia. This complicates peace efforts, she says, and makes Sweden a less safe place. Another fear is that in joining the alliance, Sweden would lose its leading role in global nuclear disarmament efforts. Margot Wallstrom recalls how some Nato foreign ministers were heavily pressured by the US not to take part in UN disarmament negotiations in 2019. But Mr Hultqvist, the current defence minister, maintains there is no contradiction between Nato membership and Sweden's disarmament ambitions. Many of Sweden's Nato-sceptics look back to the 1960s-80s, when Sweden used its neutrality to position itself as an international mediator and ally to the colonised world. It vocally criticised the Soviet Union and US, and says at one point in the 1970s it was the only Western country to support South Africa's anti-apartheid movement. If Sweden joins Nato, it would be ""abandoning the dream"" of being a mediator, Ms Solomon says. Finland's neutrality was very different. It came about as a condition of peace imposed by the Soviet Union in a 1948 ""friendship agreement"". It was seen as a pragmatic way of surviving and maintaining the country's independence. Sweden's neutrality was a matter of identity and ideology, whereas in Finland it was a question of existence, says Henrik Meinander. Part of the reason Sweden can even afford to have a debate about Nato membership is because it uses Finland and the Baltics as a ""buffer zone"", he believes. Finland abandoned its neutrality after the Soviet Union collapsed. It looked to the West and sought to free itself from the Soviet sphere of influence. Joining the European Union was seen as offering not only economic advantages but security benefits too. Iro Sarkka suggests joining Nato was seen as too big a step for Finland to take in the early 1990s, having just emerged from neutrality. But times and perceptions of risk have changed. Now, most Finns say they are ready. "
287,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-61424715,2022-05-12T15:07:44,Shell agrees to sell Russian retail business to Lukoil," Energy giant Shell has agreed to sell more than 400 of its petrol stations in Russia to the country's second largest oil producer, Lukoil. Shell Neft, the firm's subsidiary in Russia, will be sold for an undisclosed sum. Many Western oil and gas firms have been looking to offload their Russian businesses following the country's invasion of Ukraine. Shell said the deal, which includes 411 petrol stations, will protect 350 jobs. The sale also includes a lubricants blending plant around 200km north-west of Moscow. Lukoil is Russia's largest oil producer after state-backed Rosneft. Shell announced in February that it would sell its Russian assets because of the invasion of Ukraine. Earlier this month, it reported record quarterly profits as energy firms continue to benefit from surging oil and gas prices. In the first three months of this year, Shell made $9.13bn (£7.3bn) - nearly triple its $3.2bn profit it announced for the same period last year. But the firm said pulling out of Russian deals, which include the sale of its stakes in all joint business ventures with Russian state energy firm Gazprom, had cost it $3.9bn (£3.1bn). ""Under this deal, more than 350 people currently employed by Shell Neft will transfer to the new owner of this business,"" said Huibert Vigeveno, Shell's downstream director. Maxim Donde, Lukoil's vice president for refined products sales, said: ""The acquisition of Shell's high-quality businesses in Russia fits well into Lukoil's strategy to develop its priority sales channels, including retail, as well as the lubricants business."" When the conflict in Ukraine broke out, energy firms came under immediate pressure as countries announced bans and curbs on Russian oil and gas in the weeks following the invasion. BP owns a large stake in Russian energy giant Rosneft, but within days of the war starting it had announced the operation would be hived off. It was closely followed by pledges from Shell, ExxonMobil and Equinor to cut their Russian investments following pressure from shareholders, as well as from governments and the public. Total Energies, another big player in Russia, has said it will not fund new projects in the country, but unlike its peers does not plan to sell existing investments. Russia is the world's third biggest producer, after the US and Saudi Arabia. Despite widespread sanctions and many countries reducing their reliance on Russian oil, the country has almost doubled its monthly earnings from selling fossil fuels to the EU, according to the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air. The EU has imported about €22bn (£19bn) of fossil fuels per month from Russia since the start of the war as oil and gas prices have soared, compared with an average of about €12bn (£10.2bn) a month in 2021. Multinational firms that announced reductions in their business activities in Russia have begun reporting associated losses. The Lukoil deal is one of the earliest in which a Western firm, UK-listed Shell, has been able to sell off its Russian assets. The sale is still subject to regulatory approval by Russia's anti-monopoly service. "
288,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-61425025,2022-05-12T13:11:57,Ukraine conflict: Russian soldiers seen killing unarmed civilians," When Leonid Pliats and his boss were shot in the back by Russian soldiers, the killing was captured on CCTV cameras in clear and terrible detail. The footage, which was obtained by the BBC, is now being investigated by Ukrainian prosecutors as a suspected war crime. It was the height of the fighting around Kyiv and the main roads into the capital were a battlefield, including around the bicycle shop where Leonid worked as a security guard. But this was no firefight: the video clearly shows heavily armed Russian soldiers shooting the two unarmed Ukrainians and then looting the business. We have pieced together the full sequence of events, matching what was recorded on multiple CCTV cameras around the site with the testimony of people Leonid phoned that day, as well as the Ukrainian volunteer fighters who tried to rescue him. The Russians arrive in a stolen van daubed with the V sign used by Russian forces and the words Tank Spetsnaz in black paint. They wear Russian military uniform and approach with their guns up, fingers on the triggers. Leonid walks towards the soldiers with his hands up to show he's unarmed and no threat. The Russians initially talk to him and his boss through the fence. There is no audio on the footage but the men seem calm, they even smoke. Then the Ukrainians turn away and the soldiers start to leave. Suddenly they turn back, crouch then shoot the two men multiple times in their backs. One is killed outright but somehow Leonid manages to stagger to his feet. He even ties his belt around his thigh to slow the blood, then stumbles to his cabin where he begins to call for help. Vasyl Podlevskyi spoke to his friend twice that day, as he sat bleeding heavily. Leonid told him the soldiers claimed they don't kill civilians, then they shot him. ""I said can you at least bandage yourself up? And he told me, Vasya, I barely crawled here. Everything hurts so much. I feel really bad,"" Vasyl remembers the call. ""So I told him to hang in there and started phoning the territorial defence."" The men he called used to sell air conditioning before the war. Now volunteer fighters, Sasha and Kostya show me video on their mobile phones of Russian tanks rolling past their positions. Their job was to send real-time information on Russian movements to Ukraine's military positions up the road. When Leonid Pliats was injured they were tasked with crossing the dangerous E40 highway to try to save him. Even today, the road is littered with the burned-out carcasses of Russian tanks, a reminder of the intensity of the fighting. As the security guard lay bleeding, Russian troops were still on site. On the CCTV you see them shooting their way into rooms, stealing bicycles and even a scooter and lolling around in the director's office, drinking his whisky, and rifling through his cupboards. Outnumbered and only lightly armed, Sasha and Kostya were forced to wait although they realised that Leonid was dying. ""We talked to him on the phone, we tried to calm him. We told him, it's ok. Everything will be ok. You'll survive,"" Sasha tells me they did their best to comfort him. ""We said we were on our way. Maybe that helped him. Maybe. But unfortunately, by the time we made it, he was dead."" Even as they collected the two men's bodies, the volunteer fighters had to take cover as a Russian tank rolled past. There is ample evidence against the men responsible for these killings. We have studied the video in minute detail and the Russian soldier who we believe was one of the killers is clearly visible, his face uncovered. It is a long time before his friends realise they are being filmed and smash one of the security cameras. We showed the footage to the chief of police for Kyiv region and he told us the bodies of 37 civilians, all of them shot dead, were found along the road to Ukraine's capital after Russian forces were pushed back. The Prosecutor's office confirms that it is now investigating the killing of Leonid and his colleague as a possible war crime: one of more than 10,000 cases they have registered. ""My Dad was not a military man at all. He was a pensioner. They killed a 65-year-old. What for?"" Leonid's daughter, Yulia Androshchuk, wants to know. She is abroad and hasn't even been able to bury her father yet because of the war. ""I'm not so much furious as full of grief - and fear. These damn Russians are so out of control, I'm afraid of what they might do next,"" she told me. Yulia hopes those responsible will stand trial someday, somehow. For now, she wants people to know exactly what happened to her father and for the brutality to stop. "

""Repentance is going to be very difficult for Vladimir Putin now,"" Mr Johnson told LBC. It comes after the UK signed mutual security pacts with Nordic states Finland and Sweden.

""If the Ukrainians were to do any kind of deal with Putin now, the risk is that he would do exactly the same thing and they know it. ""So the short answer is no. No renormalisation - and the UK is very clear about that."" US intelligence has warned Putin is preparing for a long war in Ukraine, with even Russian victory in the east of the country - where fierce fighting continues - potentially not ending the conflict. It comes as the UK has pledged an extra £1.3bn in military support to Ukraine as forces there push back the Russian invasion. "

It was a busy day for Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who travelled to both countries as they consider joining the Nato defence alliance. Finland and Sweden have a long history of wartime neutrality, and talk of them possibly joining Nato has angered Russia, with the Kremlin warning of consequences. When asked about this, Finnish President Sauli Niinisto said: ""You [Russia] caused this - look at the mirror."" Read more about why the two Nordic countries are moving towards Nato. Ukraine says it has recaptured several villages near the north-eastern city of Kharkiv from Russian troops and pushed them back towards the border. One of the villages is Ruska Lozova, where BBC correspondent Quentin Sommerville and cameraman Darren Conway met locals who have been surviving with no power, water or means of communication. The Russian occupation has torn the village apart, both literally and figuratively. In the basement of one building, half a dozen locals have been detained, suspected of aiding the enemy. And there is one weapon Russia possibly underestimated - the force of Ukrainian solidarity. At the front line our correspondent meets an economist, a businessman, a mechanic, and a rally-driving champion among the group of volunteers fighting back Russian forces. You can read Quentin Sommerville's story here. Snake Island - where Ukrainian soldiers famously told a Russian warship to ""get lost"" but in far cruder terms - has been given an almost mythical status in this war. But it is strategically important, and the battle for control of the island and therefore of the Black Sea rages on. Want to know more about what's happening around Snake Island and why? Read our feature here. One of North America's most experienced cyber officials has warned that cyber-attacks from Russia could escalate. Rob Joyce, director of cyber-security at the US National Security Agency told the BBC's Gordon Corera that while a major cyber-conflict on the West had so far not materialised, despite warnings, Russia's cyber-threat should not be underestimated. Mr Joyce also said that cyber-vigilantes, who are attacking Russia in a show of support for Ukraine, were just as problematic. You can read Gordon Corera's report here. Ukraine needs all the good news it can get right now - so it was understandable that there were tears of joy when Ukrainian folk-rap band the Kalush Orchestra qualified for Eurovision's final on Saturday. Support for the band has swelled since the war started, and their song Stefania has become an anthem for Ukraine. ""A very emotional moment,"" one Ukrainian fan said in Turin, Italy, where the contest is being held this year. But it is also sad, she said, as they think about those fighting the war back home. "
294,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-61416320,2022-05-11T19:14:41,"Ukraine war: Don’t underestimate Russia cyber-threat, warns US"," There has been a sustained cyber-conflict over Ukraine which could still escalate, a senior US intelligence official has told the BBC. Despite warnings, major cyber-attacks on the West have so far not materialised. But Russia shouldn't be underestimated, Rob Joyce, director of cyber-security at the National Security Agency said. Meanwhile independent hackers targeting Russia in support of Ukraine could also spark escalation, he warned. ""I'm still very worried about the threats emanating from around the Russia-Ukraine situation,"" Mr Joyce, one of America's most experienced cyber officials, said. Initial surprise that Russia did not launch an all-out cyber-assault to cripple Ukrainian infrastructure as the war began has been replaced by an understanding that there has been far more aggressive activity than first thought. ""It wasn't one massive attack. But there's been a sustained conflict,"" Mr Joyce explained. This included Russia deploying eight or nine different viruses to wipe computer systems. On Tuesday the US, UK, EU and other nations accused Russia of targeting a satellite communications provider used by the Ukrainian military, a hack which spilled over to affect other customers in Europe. But Ukraine's defences have held up relatively well, partly thanks to its experience going back years. Paul Chichester, the director of operations at the UK's National Cyber Security Centre describes the cyber-clash as ""the most sustained set of cyber operations coming up against the best collective defence we have seen"". So far Russia has not responded to sanctions with cyber-attacks on Western companies or infrastructure, as many had predicted. But multiple officials told the BBC they were worried that as sanctions bite on the Russian economy and as the conflict continues, Moscow could turn to that weapon later in the year. ""Our worry is that it's a decision point,"" Mr Joyce said. ""When that decision point happens, there certainly is capability to come after some of that (Western) infrastructure."" And as time goes on, it may be difficult to maintain the current heightened state of alert in the private sector - something which is concerning British and American security officials. Mr Joyce also warned another risk of escalation could come from activist or ""vigilante"" hackers who have been targeting Russia in a show of support for Ukraine. Some Western officials say this aspect of the conflict took them by surprise, as a cyber free-for-all broke out in which individuals were targeting Russian institutions and companies and publishing stolen information on the internet. ""We all want to cheer for the people who are trying to help in this situation. But it actually is a problem,"" Mr Joyce said. ""We want to hold other nations accountable for the cyber activities that come from vigilantes and criminals inside their countries. And so we have to support those international norms, we have to understand that there are rules, there are crimes, and there are lines that can be crossed."" One risk, he said, was that Russia could interpret these hacks as having the support of Western governments and then strike back. ""There's the problem of the reprisals in that whole cycle of cyber-violence,"" Mr Joyce explained. One piece of perhaps surprising news though is that ransomware attacks - when computer data is encrypted and hackers demand money for it to be released - are actually down. Mr Joyce said he believed this was partly because many of the gangs, which operate out of Russia, were finding it hard to use Western credit cards and infrastructure to launch their attacks because of sanctions. In his opening remarks at the CYBERUK conference in Wales this week, the Director of the Government Communications Headquarters also revealed that joint intelligence-military teams from the UK's National Cyber Force had been operating against criminal gangs - including by hacking them back to retrieve credit card details that had been stolen from the public.

297,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-61406808,2022-05-11T15:03:14,Ukraine war: Snake Island and battle for control in Black Sea," Right from the start of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Snake Island was given a vital and almost mythical status in the war. This unremarkable, rocky outcrop in the Black Sea was seized by Russia and has become a battleground of strategic value. Russia claims Ukraine has sustained disastrous losses in a failed bid to recapture the island, including special forces, warplanes, helicopters and drones. Ukraine insists it has limited its campaign to attacking facilities on the island and boats. The battle is not over and Russia is repeatedly trying to reinforce its exposed garrison, says UK defence ministry intelligence. Snake or Zmiinyi Island is a fraction of a square kilometre in size and there are no more snakes to speak of. But there can be no doubt of its importance for control of the western Black Sea. ""If Russian troops succeed in occupying Snake Island and set up their long-range air-defence systems, they will control the sea, land and air in the north-west part of the Black Sea and in the south of Ukraine,"" Ukrainian military expert Oleh Zhdanov told the BBC. That is why Russia's flagship Moskva sailed there within hours of the start of the war, telling Ukrainian soldiers on the island to give themselves up: ""I suggest you lay down your weapons and surrender to avoid bloodshed and needless casualties. Otherwise, you will be bombed,"" said a Russian officer. ""Russian warship get lost,"" came the now legendary response, although in far cruder language. The island was seized but weeks later the Moskva was sunk. Losing the Moskva means Russia's supply ships to the island now have minimal protection, says the UK, although, if it can consolidate its position, then it could dominate a large part of the Black Sea. A reinforced Russian presence could be disastrous for Ukraine, strategically as well as economically. Ukraine has already had to close its port at Odesa, suspending vital grain exports, but Mr Zhdanov fears the island could also be used as a second frontline. ""If the Russians succeed in installing long-range air defence systems then they will be able to defend their squadron, which can reach Ukraine's coastline."" It would also give Russian troops the chance to break into Transnistria, Moldova's breakaway territory under Russian control that lies next-door to Ukraine and not far from Odesa. However, Snake Island is a mere 45km (28 miles) away from the coast of Romania, which is part of the West's Nato alliance. UK naval analyst Jonathan Bentham believes a Russian S-400 air missile system on the island would be a ""big game-changer"". If Russia were able to deploy a missile system, not only would Odesa come under threat, but Nato's southern flank would be endangered, too, warns Romanian historian Dorin Dobrincu. ""This is very important for the Romanian government and people but also for the entire alliance. Russia would have the capacity to destroy cities and military capability in the east of our territory."" Nato reinforced Romania's borders from the start of the war, sending in Belgian and French forces. But there are major economic risks, too, for Romania. Snake Island lies close to the mouth of the River Danube, which delineates Romania's border with Ukraine. Romania's Black Sea port of Constanta is not far south and has been taking in container ships that are no longer able to sail to Odesa. Russian military-political analyst Alexander Mikhailov said troops on Snake Island could be in a position to control traffic into the north-western Black Sea and the Danube delta - the gateway to south-eastern Europe. ""If there's a military base or military infrastructure, it would be possible to block ships that enter the river as well as leave,"" he told Russian media. Romania's Euro-Atlantic Resilience Centre believes Russia may decide to annex the island and control as many Black Sea shipping routes as possible towards the Bosphorus in Turkey. Historically, Snake Island was Romanian territory until it was ceded in 1948 to the Soviet Union, which used it as a radar base. As Romania came under Soviet influence until 1989, Bucharest accepted the arrangement. Ukraine took control with the fall of communism and eventually in 2009 the International Court of Justice drew up the island's territorial limits, giving Romania almost 80% of the Black Sea continental shelf near the island, and Ukraine the rest. Snake Island is not just of strategic use, because this part of the Black Sea is rich in hydrocarbon resources - so The Hague ruling means both countries possess reserves of petroleum and gas. It may seem to be a small clump of rock with little obvious value, but its fate is a major element of Russia's war. "
298,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-61378196,2022-05-11T12:10:31,Ukraine war: Russia pushed back from Kharkiv - report from front line," Ukraine says its forces have recaptured villages from Russian troops north and north-east of Kharkiv, pushing them back towards the border. The continuing offensive could signal a shift in the war's momentum and jeopardise Russia's main advance further south. BBC correspondent Quentin Sommerville, and cameraman Darren Conway, have been with Ukrainian forces as they advance. The village of Ruska Lozova stands at the centre of the turn in Ukraine's response to Russian aggression. It was recently liberated in a co-ordinated effort led by senior military commanders. Ukrainian troops from territorial defence, the national guard and the regular army are seeking to push the Russians back along a 32-km (20-mile) front line. In the Russian city of Belgorod, just across the border, troops have amassed for a likely counter-offensive. We drove north from the city of Kharkhiv with Ukrainian forces. Russian shells continued to hit the village. With no power or water, little food, and neither phone or internet, its residents had been isolated from Ukraine's second-largest city - just 8km (5 miles) south. From the woods and hills nearby, Russian mortars and artillery shelled Kharkiv relentlessly. At an army aid station, we met Raisa Opanasivna who has lived in Ruska Lozova for 30 years. The 66-year-old approached the Ukrainian soldiers, weighed down by history, and two large plastic shopping bags. Under a knitted grey beanie, her gaunt face was weather-beaten, her slim frame stooped. She hadn't seen this many people for months. Since the beginning of the war, her village had been under Russian occupation. The Russians had come house to house. ""They were checking homes, asking if we have rifles. But I have nothing. I'm alone,"" Raisa said. Ruska Lozova has been torn apart, but more than that, Raisa's whole world had been upended by Russia's invasion. In the east, the war is bringing not just a re-examination of people's relationship to Russia - barely 30km north - but a more personal reassessment of what it means to be a Russian-speaking Ukrainian. A month ago, the Russians were literally at the gates to Kharkiv. The shelling was constant - and buildings in the street we were staying in were being hit. It became so bad that it was easier to count the hours of silence than the hours of explosions. It felt like being on the edge of an abyss, where one more concerted Russian attack could rupture the city. In the northern Saltivka neighbourhood, entire apartment blocks had been destroyed. Those who had stayed behind had no electricity or water, and were reduced to cooking food on small fires they had made in their stairwells. But the spectre of Russian victory, which haunted this city, has gone. Last week I sat in a city centre park, its grass neatly cut, its flower beds blooming, and enjoyed an ice cream sundae from a cafe. The city is still largely empty, but the number of Russian artillery strikes has fallen from dozens daily, to only a handful. Air raid sirens still wail regularly, but Kharkiv no longer feels on the brink of catastrophe. Ukrainian gains, modest for now, could have strategic implications for Russia's war in the Donbas to the south-east, threatening the invaders' supply lines. As we headed north from Kharkiv with Ukrainian forces to villages and towns that mark the new frontline - the road remained strewn with craters and spent Russian rockets. At the highway's edges there were destroyed Russian vehicles and burned-out lorries, which had been used to block their initial attack on Kharkiv. We drove at speed - the commander of a volunteer unit behind the wheel, had his rifle propped in the footwell. ""The sides of the road are mined,"" he said, as the car lurched through a chicane of roadblocks and tank traps. Ours was the only car on the road, and we were aware that, on the forested hill in front of us, Russian tanks and artillery were still roaming. War in the Kharkiv region has changed - it's now a game of hawk and mouse, where each side's drones circle constantly, trying to pinpoint the enemy's tanks and guns, for targeting by artillery. We passed a Russian Grad rocket launcher lying in a ditch, and a smashed-up military green Lada, with the Russian ""Z"" insignia painted white on its doors. ""Russia's secret weapon,"" the commander said, to laughter among his men. Near Ruska Lozova, scorch marks on the road were all that remained of a civilian vehicle destroyed by a Russian shell. The wreck was gone, but its contents were spilled across the road - a pink blanket here, some clothing there. A number of people were killed in the strike. The village shows the effects of the battle for control. Homes have been wrecked by shelling and some buildings still burn. One house we passed had a shattered roof, while bright red tulips lined up in an orderly fashion at its gate. The battle has become more fluid, and the men don't linger in the open. They run across open ground at speed and climb walls to avoid Russian fire from the woods, less than half a kilometre away. They believe Russian fighters have left, and it's mostly men from the separatist Donbas region they are fighting. But the day after we left, more Russians were captured near the front. We had to take cover suddenly in a foxhole, their first line against the enemy as the Russian artillery again opened fire and shells whizzed overhead. They landed on the other side of the village seconds later. At an anti-tank position, US-supplied Javelin anti-tank missiles, along with their British-supplied versions, lay ready for use. Manning this lookout were two volunteers, who replied to me in French. They are Ukrainian, but joined the French Foreign Legion. One told me that he'd been serving for three years, but had deserted to join the fight for Ukraine. That is perhaps a weapon Russia underestimated - the force of Ukrainian solidarity. Even before Western military aid began arriving here, this was what anchored Ukraine's defences. Among the group of volunteers are an economist, a businessman, a mechanic, and a rally-driving champion. I met the commander before Victory Day on 9 May - which Russia and Ukraine celebrate as the Soviet Union's defeat over Germany's Nazi regime during World War Two - and asked him what it meant this year. He feels it has been tainted. ""I was born in the Soviet Union,"" he continues, sipping on some freshly brewed tea. ""Russians, to my regret, use everything as weapons. Our common dates, our common language, our common religion. Russia doesn't hesitate to use all means. That is why everybody here now hates the Russian language - even Russian poet Alexander Pushkin is persona non grata - that is why our church is split, and everything which is Russian will be renamed here."" Few people remain in the town of Ruska Losova. Raisa, in her grey coat and woollen hat approached army medics, numb to the shelling around her, and the wounds it had inflicted upon on her body. Her face was peppered with shrapnel and half of her finger was missing. More from Quentin Sommerville When she removed her jacket, her slim arm was sliced open at the bicep. ""Cut like a chicken fillet. Can you remove the shrapnel?"" Raisa asks. Perhaps it was because she hadn't seen people for months, or because of a stroke last year, but she has only just regained the ability to talk. Her story began to pour out. A group of soldiers gathered around her. ""When I was giving birth there were three of us mothers. I was in the middle. They were screaming. I was calm. I took a strap from the shirt to my mouth. The doctor told me to scream. But I said it doesn't matter if you are screaming or not. It's still painful. That's how I gave birth to my son. Quietly."" The men around her were wincing as she told them to cut off the loose skin with scissors. One soldier looked queasy as the medic patched her up. As it was happening, she reflected on the fate of her village and of an empire she had seen disintegrate - her home and her history in ruins. She lived through the Soviet Union at a time when Russia and Ukraine were countries intertwined. For years, she lived in East Germany, where she became pregnant, and returned to Ukraine to give birth alone. ""My father and [Putin's] father were fighting together against Hitler, right? Could that really be possible? And now we fight against each other,"" she told us. ""[We were] the closest nations. This has never happened before. There were German invaders and now these are our people."" After being bandaged up, Raisa was escorted to a waiting car, to take her to hospital in Kharkiv. Most of the people in the village are being evacuated, buses waiting to transport those without cars. The Russian occupation has torn the village apart, both literally and figuratively. In the basement of one building, half a dozen locals have been detained. They are suspected of aiding the enemy. Their eyes are covered with balaclavas taped over their heads, their hands tied. At least one woman is among them. They are left alone in a room, then taken away to the security services for questioning. Their phones will be checked and their social media, too. Police checkpoints on the road into Kharkiv question everyone coming from the liberated areas, looking for saboteurs. Collaborators face 15 years in prison, or a life imprisonment if their actions caused Ukrainian deaths. It's unlikely Raisa can ever forgive Russia for the wounds she has suffered. And with every battle, the men on the front line are freeing themselves from the bindings that once held these two nations together. But the operation north of Kharkiv isn't complete and it has been costly. It is only one front in what looks as though it will be a long war. Follow Quentin on Twitter @sommervilletv © 2022 BBC.

Mr Thomas said a type D work visa is available from the Polish Government for people who want to study, but he is fearful he may not be eligible. If he did apply the wait times could be more than six weeks for an appointment at the Polish Embassy, he added. Mr Thomas said volunteers helping with Ukraine conflict humanitarian work are in a ""desperate"" visa situation. ""We're all running out of days on our Schengen allowance. we have our 90 days,"" he said. ""The war is pretty much 90 days in so people like us are now coming up against the reality of whether to go home and abandon what we're doing or try and potentially move out of the EU and be based in Western Ukraine."" A spokesperson from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office advised people to check with the Polish Embassy what type of visa or work permit they may need. ""Polands' entry requirements are a matter for the Polish government,"" they said. ""The FCDO continues to advise those wanting to help Ukrainians in need to donate through established charities and humanitarian partners."" Mr Thomas criticised the government's advice and said there was a lack of ""big NGOs [non-governmental organisations]"" in the region. ""Hopefully they are doing some good somewhere but they are not where we are so a massive hole will be left when we are told to pack up and leave,"" he added.

304,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-61402829,2022-05-11T00:31:37,"Ukraine war: Putin preparing for long haul, US intelligence says"," Vladimir Putin is preparing for a long war in Ukraine, with even victory in the east potentially not ending the conflict, US intelligence has warned. The warning comes as fierce fighting continues in the east, where Russia is trying to take territory. Moscow refocused its troops on capturing the Donbas region after Ukraine resisted attempts to take its capital, Kyiv. But despite this, its forces remain in a stalemate, US intelligence said. Avril Haines, the director of national intelligence, told a US Senate committee hearing on Tuesday that Mr Putin was still intending ""to achieve goals beyond the Donbas"", but that he ""faces a mismatch between his ambitions and Russia's current conventional military capabilities"". She added that the Russian president was ""probably"" counting on US and EU support for Ukraine to weaken as inflation, food shortages and energy prices got worse. However, the Russian president could turn to ""more drastic means"" as the war continues - although Moscow would only use nuclear weapons if Mr Putin perceived an ""existential threat"" to Russia. Defence Intelligence Agency Director Scott Berrier told the same hearing that the Russians and the Ukrainians were ""at a bit of a stalemate"". In the latest fighting, Ukraine claims to have recaptured four settlements in the north-eastern Kharkiv region. Cherkasy Tyshky, Ruski Tyshky, Rubizhne and Bayrak were all snatched back from Russia, Ukraine's armed forces said. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said Ukrainian successes were gradually pushing Russian forces out of Kharkiv, which has been bombarded since the war began.

It has been hammered by sanctions introduced by Western countries since February. The initial shock forced the stock market in Russia to close temporarily and saw people queueing up at cash machines, worried about their savings. The rouble has, however, returned to pre-war levels, due to careful management by Russia's central bank. Its interventions included limiting the amount of money people could transfer abroad, as well as forcing firms that export things to convert 80% of their overseas incomes into Russian currency. The country has also managed to avoid defaulting on its foreign debts. President Putin has insisted that the West's ""economic blitzkrieg"" has failed. But Elina Ribakova, deputy chief economist at the Institute of International Finance, says these ""superficial"" indicators ""don't mean much to real life"". Russian steelmakers, chemical manufacturers and car companies are already feeling the brunt of sanctions aimed at crippling President Putin's war effort. A recent survey of more than 13,000 businesses by Russia's central bank revealed that many are experiencing problems bringing goods such as microchips, car parts, packaging, or even buttons, into the country as a result. Shortages of raw materials or parts are forcing some firms to temporarily close factories or to look elsewhere. Japanese car-maker Toyota, for example, stopped imports of cars to Russia and suspended operations at its plant in St Petersburg in March, citing ""supply chain disruptions"" linked to the conflict. BlueBay Asset Management economist Timothy Ash says that overall sanctions have been much more aggressive than many had expected. ""I think the longer-term impact will be devastating,"" he tells the BBC, adding that ""Russia being cut out of Western supply chains because it is an unreliable partner"" will push the country into recession. Even the Bank of Russia has acknowledged that as companies look for different suppliers, deal with boycotts by shipping companies or fail to get hold of the technology they need, the country will face a period of ""reverse industrialisation"". ""The reality is, Russia will have limited access to financial markets, lower growth, lower living standards and a higher cost of borrowing,"" Mr Ash adds. Of course, that impact spills out. Many ordinary Russians, Ms Ribakova says, are ""living in a grey area"", particularly when it comes to job security. ""A lot of people have no idea what's going to happen... They might still be going out to restaurants, going to work and not seeing much of a change yet because the companies they work for are unclear about their plans."" By Anastasiia Stognei, business reporter, BBC Russian Olga, 30, is a Moscow bank employee. She is trying to stick to her pre-war standards of living but it is increasingly difficult. Like many Russians, she has to ask a friend living in Europe to pay for her Netflix and Spotify, after Visa and Mastercard left Russia. Earlier this month, she booked a flight to go on holiday to Turkey - one of very few foreign destinations still open to Russians. Before the war a plane ticket would have cost her 15,000 roubles (£170). Now she's had to pay 55,000 roubles (£640). Olga is praying it will be possible to update her iPhone and MacBook laptop when outside of Russia - Apple has also ceased operations in the country. For 79-year-old Lyudmila from Voronezh, a city 500km south of Moscow, basic necessities have become a lot more expensive. ""I go to a market once a week. Every time things get more and more pricey. Last time milk went up by five roubles, tomatoes by 10."" Dmitry, 33, is a masseur from the small Siberian town of Rubtsovsk. Before the war he had a good life, spending around 300 roubles (£3.50) a day. ""Sausage, bread, go to the banya [Russian sauna] once a week with friends."" Since 24 February, when the war began, his expenses have jumped by 50%. Despite economic difficulties, Dmitry supports the war. He says some of his friends complain about the prices and also that it is no longer possible to watch any Western blockbusters in cinemas. Despite everything, most Russians still firmly support this war. The TV set, filled with official propaganda, is still more powerful than an empty fridge. Symbolic Western brands, such as McDonald's and Levi's, continue to pay thousands of Russian employees, despite halting operations in the country. But there are fears that job losses will start to mount as hopes fade that the war will come to an end soon. Moscow's Mayor Sergey Sobyanin warned in April that about 200,000 jobs were at risk in the city alone, while Trading Economics forecasts that the unemployment rate across Russia could jump to 7% by 2024. And there has already been a big exodus of IT workers and other professionals, in what Mr Ash describes as a ""brain drain"". Several consultancies have pulled workers out of the country, while reports by the Latvia-based independent Russian news website Meduza suggest up to 5,000 Yandex employees left Russia, with some citing concerns over the tech giant's censorship of war-related content. For those that remain, making ends meet is a big worry. ""There's this idea that Russians are used to difficult conditions, but they have lived through 20 years of relative prosperity,"" Mr Ash said. ""They've known the good life."" While there were reports of shortages of things like cooking oils around the outbreak of the war, supermarket shelves are reportedly well-stocked now - but items are pricier. Many countries are grappling with soaring prices in the wake of the pandemic. But in the face of a shrinking economy and supply chains being disrupted, economists expect that inflation, which tracks how the cost of living changes over time, could hit at least 20% in Russia in 2022. Mr Ash and Ms Ribakova recall friends struggling to get hold of heart or thyroid medicine, but say it is the poorest Russians who will notice the increasing cost of living the most. President Putin has pledged that pensions and unemployment benefits for those struggling would rise in line with inflation. And the Russian government does have its own financial lifeline, even with unprecedented levels of sanctions in place. It is still able to sell a lot of oil and gas - a key pillar of its economy. According to figures from Russia's central bank, it exported goods and services worth $58.2bn (£47.2bn) more than the value of its imports in the first three months of 2022 - with numbers pushed up by higher energy prices. Although the US has announced a ban on Russian energy imports, Europe is still divided on how to wind down dependence on Russian supplies. Europe gets about 40% of its natural gas from Russia, which is also the bloc's main oil supplier, but some countries are more dependent on Russian fossil fuels than others, so sudden supply cuts could have a big economic impact. ""There is no doubt that Europe will have a difficult few years going away from Russian oil and gas, but this is much worse for the Russian economy, which will suffer in the long-term,"" Ole Hvalbye, an energy analyst with the SEB bank, says. While Russia might have enough of a financial cushion to provide subsidies to the poorest in the short-term, as well as to protect the rouble, Mr Ash says the long-term view is more uncertain. But he adds: ""Whatever happens, whether an oil embargo is introduced in six months or a year... it will be a severe hit"" for an economy isolated from the West. "

""President Putin is preparing for prolonged conflict in Ukraine,"" US Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines told a hearing in the Senate. ""[Putin] is probably counting on US and EU resolve to weaken as food shortages, inflation and energy prices get worse,"" Ms Haines said. The threat to global food supplies was a theme throughout the day, as the Russian blockade of Black Sea ports continues to cripple Ukraine's ability to export grain. There will be a ""global food crisis"" if nothing is done, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said. European Council President Charles Michel described seeing masses of grain stranded in silos in Odesa. On the ground in Ukraine, our colleagues Sophie Williams and Olga Pona reported on a terrible discovery in a city where fighting is still raging. The bodies of 44 civilians have been found in the rubble of a collapsed building in Izyum in the east, and officials fear that number could rise. The five-storey building collapsed in March as residents hid in the basement from Russian shelling. But rescuers have only just been able to reach the site, one local official said. You can read more on this story here. Elsewhere, in the south of Ukraine, the Russian military continued to attack the Azovstal steelworks in Mariupol on Tuesday. The plant is the last place of resistance in the city, which has been almost entirely been destroyed after two months of bombardment. Capturing Mariupol is a key war aim of Moscow, because doing so would give it control of one of Ukraine's biggest ports and easier access to the wider region. Want to know more about why Russia is targeting the east? Read our explainer here. French President Emmanuel Macron visited his German counterpart in Berlin on Monday evening. The Ukraine invasion has shifted the balance of power in the EU. Are France and Germany still the two key players? Perhaps not. Our Europe Editor Katya Adler takes a deeper look. Back at the start of the war, thousands of Ukrainians experienced sudden web outages after satellite broadband services went down. Western intelligence officials today revealed that they believe this was the consequence of a Russia-orchestrated hack. At the time the attack affected American satellite company Viasat but the real target was the Ukrainian military, security agencies said. Social media is another front on which Russia is waging its cyber war. And some of the accounts expressing the staunchest pro-Kremlin views aren't all they claim to be. In fact, a BBC investigation has traced several to stolen identities. One of them belongs to Indian social media influencer ER Yamini, who despite never tweeting in her life became the face of a fake pro-Putin account. When Arkady Perchenko was 11 years old, he fought alongside the Soviet Army as part of the local resistance against the Nazis. Now 92, he has been forced to leave his home in Ukraine to escape from Russian forces. Arkady spoke to us about his view of both wars from Israel. When asked if he has a message for Russia, his answer was simple: ""I have no words"". "
307,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-61396331,2022-05-10T16:33:30,UK blames Russia for satellite internet hack at start of war," Russia was behind a cyber-attack targeting American commercial satellite internet company Viasat, UK and US intelligence suggests. The attack began about an hour before Russia invaded Ukraine, on 24 February. It caused outages for several thousand Ukrainian customers - and affected windfarms and internet users in Central Europe. Officials have long believed Russia was to blame but lacked the evidence to say so publicly. Viasat provides high-speed satellite broadband to commercial and military customers. The company has previously said ""tens of thousands of terminals"" were damaged beyond repair, in the cyber-attack, though its core network infrastructure and the satellite itself remained unscathed. Now, a joint announcement by the EU, UK, US and other allies confirms long-held suspicions the primary target was the Ukrainian military. And the UK's National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) said it was ""almost certain"" Russia was behind the attack. Explaining the decision to publicly identify Russia, NCSC chief executive Lindy Cameron told BBC news: ""It is important to challenge the ability to do this with impunity."" The war in Ukraine has seen the most sustained offensive cyber-operations one country has launched against another, a British intelligence official says. Some were surprised there was not more evidence of destructive attacks when the invasion began. But it has taken time for a fuller picture to emerge - such as this major attack on satellite communications now linked to Russia. Directly in support of military operations, this attack also spilled over to other countries. So far though, Russia has not launched wider attacks against Western targets. And one reason we may not have seen the scale of destructive activity inside Ukraine that some predicted, the intelligence official says, is Russia's offense came up against a country that had worked hard on its defences and could see off many of the attacks. At the NCSC Cyber UK event, operations director Paul Chichester told me the Russians, for the past few years, had been making Ukrainians ""match-fit"". Russian military intelligence - the GRU - had been involved in the 13 January defacements of Ukrainian government websites and attacks using a type of destructive malware called Whispergate in the same month, it added. Whispergate was deployed in the months before the conflict, against organisations in Ukraine, in an effort to ""to destroy computer systems and render them inoperable"", according to the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency. The UK has already sanctioned the GRU, after a nerve-agent attack in Salisbury, Wilts, left one person dead and several others seriously ill. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said in a statement accompanying the announcement: ""This is clear and shocking evidence of a deliberate and malicious attack by Russia against Ukraine which had significant consequences on ordinary people and businesses in Ukraine and across Europe."" Viasat told the BBC ""We recognize international governments have identified who they believe to be responsible for the cyberattack on the KA-SAT network. ""We have and will continue to work closely with relevant law enforcement and governmental authorities as part of the ongoing investigation"". "

The five-storey building collapsed in March as residents hid in the basement from Russian shelling. But rescuers have only just been able to reach the building, one local official told the BBC. And there are fears the death toll could rise further, as another building in the same street was also targeted. ""We know there were people in there as well. The search work is continuing and I think we will know more numbers of victims soon,"" Izyum mayor Valeriy Marchenko told the BBC. Russia seized control of Izyum on 1 April and troops have occupied the city since. Mr Marchenko said when the buildings were attacked, Russian troops had seized control of half of the city. As troops tried to advance, they fired directly at the building where the bodies have now been retrieved. Rescuers have only been able to reach it now because the apartment block was in an occupied area of the city. ""It only became possible a couple of days ago for our State Emergency Service to get there and start taking apart the rubble,"" he said. There is no special equipment to clear the rubble with everything done manually. Those taking part in the clearance effort are only able to do so when the shelling stops, according to Kharkiv regional governor Oleh Synyehubov. Izyum, known as the gateway to the Donbas, is part of Ukraine's old coal and steel-producing region and a key city for the Russian military. However, officials say Ukrainian troops are making gains in the region and stopping any further Russian advances. Mr Synyehubov told the BBC that Russian forces ""are not currently conducting active offensive actions because they [Ukrainian forces] are defending"". He added that they were failing to move forward to other targets away from the city. A report by the Institute for the Study of War confirmed this. ""Russian forces did not make any confirmed advances to the south-east or south-west of Izyum on 9 May,"" the report said, adding that they were likely to resume offensive operations in the coming days. Those who have escaped Izyum have told of living in basements for months and seeing dead bodies in the streets. Communication with those still inside the city has been cut off. ""There is no city centre any more. It was so nice there before. All the tall buildings are destroyed,"" a woman who gave her name as Elena told the BBC. ""There was no single day without shelling,"" she said. "

Andy Gilbride and his wife Grazyna, both 56, have welcomed six refugees into their home in Timperley, Greater Manchester. Ms Gilbride's Polish mother fled the Russian army during the start of World War Two and was looked after in India. ""My wife's mum only survived because of someone's help,"" Mr Gilbride said. He told the Local Democracy Reporting Service how his wife's grandfather and his young sons were killed by the Russians during the conflict. Mr Gilbride said his mother-in-law, who was then a little girl, was put on a sledge with her three sisters and sent away as refugees. ""She was taken in in India and lived there for the last four years of the war,"" he said. ""I would not have my wife if that had not happened. That is why we are doing this."" The Gilbrides used social media to offer Ukrainians shelter and then went through the government scheme. A total of 199 visas for Ukrainians have been issued in Trafford - the most visas handed out in any other area of Greater Manchester. Mothers Oleana and Gilana, both 38, fled Lviv with their two sons and two daughters and arrived in England on 1 May. Mr Gilbride said Oleana's girl Milana, aged nine, stopped talking after the war started and had not spoken for almost five weeks. He told of how one of the boys, aged 17, was ""quite traumatised"" but added the families had since ""settled in brilliantly"". ""Gilana had a job interview this week and the little girl is talking again,"" he said. Mr Gilbride said Trafford Council had rigorously checked the fire alarms, electrics, fire doors in their home prior to the arrival of the families. The council also gives host families £350 per month to help cover costs. Mr Gilbride said he has been supported by his friend Trevor Kells and his company Rich Sauces who have sent money to feed refugees in the UK. He added the manufacturer had forwarded cash to those in need in Ukraine and those making their way through Europe. Mr Gilbride said that he had a pot of money for his daughter's wedding he was ""dipping into"" for the refugees. He added: ""If it comes round to it and we do not have enough for the wedding, we will just take out a loan, I do not care."" Why not follow BBC North West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram?

But the sorry consequence of marrying Olena now in case something happens to him if he's called up, is his parents can't be there on his big day. ""Mama don't cry,"" Sasha tells his mum, who has fled to the sanctuary of Wales. Mum, also called Olena, and dad Joseph will watch the wedding on a Skype video call. Sasha's mum was in her home-town of Odesa in the south of the country when Russia invaded Ukraine in February but she fled after her husband, originally from the UK, made a mercy dash from Wales to get her. Sasha wasn't able to escape with them because men under 60 aren't allowed to leave Ukraine in case they're needed to help the war effort. So Sasha's parents suffered the heartbreak of leaving their son, a 21-year-old barber with congenital heart disease, behind in Odesa, a major port and Ukraine's third biggest city, which still remains in Ukraine control. Now mum Olena faces the added upset of missing Sasha's wedding on 1 June, two years after meeting his girlfriend online. ""It's very hard,"" said Sasha's mum from her new home in Tredegar in the Gwent Valleys. ""I didn't want to leave him there. If something happened now in Odesa I won't find myself any peace."" Between regular warning sirens, Sasha shows his parents what daily life looks like for him now, including in the bunker he's built under their garage. ""We're used to the sirens, but you know, when you see a lot of people running and panicking, you do the same,"" said Sasha. ""Everyone was pushing, some fell down, it was scary, but I'm still pretty much going to stay here and do what I can."" Joseph is concerned how much water and food Sasha has left and has urged him to stockpile more in case of a biological attack, or water shortages. ""He's got a heart condition, so with the best will in the world he's not going to last five minutes in those circumstances,"" said his worried father. ""I just want him to live."" While Olena is enjoying the sanctuary of south Wales, her mind is always back with her only child. ""I hate to think of chemical or biological weapons, I don't want my son to suffer because of someone's ambition,"" she said. ""In the morning, first thing, the phone is in my hands... until I go bed… and I'm watching until I get tired and fall asleep. It's always on your mind... always, you can't let it go."" Joseph is helping his wife apply for a visa to remain in the UK as Olena clings on to hope she'll see her son and soon-to-be daughter-in-law again. ""It's very peaceful here, this is how life should be,"" she said. ""I hope he will be ok, this is what is keeping me going. After every rain, the sun will come out."" "

First Aid At Work instructor Steve Brooks from Shepton Mallet travelled to the war-torn state to deliver life-saving equipment and skills. The 46-year-old former Army medic was supported by local group Somerset Aid for Ukraine and his wife Tabby at home. Mr Brooks said watching news about the conflict on his sofa when he was ill had inspired him to volunteer abroad. ""The bombing of the maternity hospital was horrendous, the schools were horrendous. ""I decided that I could be ill lying on my sofa or I could be ill helping other people, so I decided to help other people,"" he added. Mr Brooks, who previously worked for the Royal Army Medical Corps, made an official request to the Ukrainian government to fly over and help train their troops in first aid. He spent six weeks providing a course with ""three of four life-saving skills"" for the battlefield. His work as an NHS responder during the pandemic had helped to refresh his first aid skills, he said. Somerset Aid for Ukraine and Mrs Brooks helped to co-ordinate sending medical supplies, such as tourniquets and haemostatic dressings, to his station. Mr Brooks said he was scared ""all the time"" but became so tired that he ""couldn't even be bothered"" to wake up for air raids. ""So I just put a pillow over my head and hoped for the best."" Mrs Brooks said: ""The first day he told me [he wanted to travel to Ukraine] I was really angry because I was frightened, but then we got into practical mode. ""It became something he needed to do."" ""Some of the things that I saw human beings doing to other human beings will probably stay with me for the rest of my life,"" Mr Brooks said. ""What's going on in Ukraine is terrifying, but the most humbling thing I have ever been through."" He said he still found time to listen to his local BBC Radio station while he was there. ""I always listened to BBC Radio Somerset in the mornings. ""I wanted to lighten the mood a little bit when I was over there so I would put it on and get other people involved.

312,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-61386058,2022-05-10T03:24:00,EU balance of power knocked by war in Ukraine," Freshly re-elected Emmanuel Macron chose 9 May to come to dinner in Berlin. An auspicious date in EU circles. Nicknamed ""Europe Day"", it commemorates the signing of the post World War Two Schuman declaration promoting peace between European nations. A very different vision of Europe to that of Vladimir Putin, the French president noted. Together, he said, France and Germany carried the ambition for a stronger, more sovereign, more democratic, more united EU, able to rise to the challenges currently facing the continent. It's EU tradition for French and German leaders to visit each other as the first trip abroad following their election. An intentionally symbolic display of the bloc's Franco-German motor purring, even roaring ahead. At least, they hope that's the message transmitted. But how united and influential are France and Germany in today's EU? I'd argue the Russia-Ukraine crisis has fundamentally shifted not only EU security dynamics, but the balance of power in the bloc too. And it's no longer just about France and Germany. When Mr Macron first came to Berlin back in 2017, he was a rookie compared to then Chancellor Angela Merkel. But her successor Olaf Scholz has handled Russia sanctions and weapons deliveries to Ukraine slowly and clumsily during the current crisis - frustrating voters at home and allies abroad. I asked Mr Scholz at his press conference with Mr Macron whether he was concerned about Germany's reputation and leadership role in Europe as a result. He robustly defended Germany's record. Berlin in the end moved dramatically to reverse its reliance on Russian energy (moving from a 35% to a 12% reliance on Russian oil within a few weeks). It put historical angst and innate risk-aversion aside, (belatedly) delivering heavy weapons to Ukraine. And Mr Scholz turned German defence priorities on their head early on in the crisis, promising to invest €100bn ($100bn; £85bn) in modernising the armed forces and increasing defence spending to the 2% of GDP requested by Nato. But by huffing and puffing and dragging its heels before taking action, the impression Germany has given is of a reluctant or backseat member of the Western alliance when it comes to countering the Kremlin. ""We should send signals of strength not weakness to the Kremlin. This just encourages the Russian president to do what he is doing,"" according to Peter Beyer, a Christian Democratic Union MP and member of the German Parliament's defence committee. ""I don't want to be critical just because my party is now in opposition,"" he insisted to me But, he said, Olaf Scholz seems always to have to be pushed into action by others, by public opinion or by criticism from European partners. ""And why should that be? We're Germany. We shouldn't just lead economically but also politically but [Mr Scholz] isn't in the driving seat."" Indeed in the diplomatic, defence, economic and energy crisis Europe currently finds itself in - where as one EU leader after another notes Russia has brought war and the threat of nuclear attack back to the continent - mighty power Germany has conspicuously failed to take the lead. And so Mr Macron believes this to be his moment. Time for Germany to play sous-chef, he thinks, while he drives the EU initiative. Angela Merkel rather squashed his reformist zeal, but Macron's ideas of promoting EU sovereignty in new technologies, defence, energy and food production have now been gaining traction. A result of Russia's belligerence in Ukraine and the strain on global supply chains caused by the Covid pandemic. France currently holds the EU's rotating presidency. Before coming to Berlin on Monday, Mr Macron addressed the European Parliament on his vision for the bloc's future. This included the not entirely new idea of establishing an outer EU circle of like-minded nations including ""those who have left the EU"" (a clear nod to the UK) and others waiting to join, like Ukraine and countries in the western Balkans. And while there's smouldering resentment that Germany has been too soft for too long on Moscow - driven largely, it's believed, by economic interests - many of the same critics are also impatient with Mr Macron for repeatedly pursuing diplomatic openings with Vladimir Putin. Poland and the Baltic nations along with other hawkish former communist countries like the Czech Republic have pushed to take the lead in Nato and EU defence decisions during the Russia-Ukraine crisis. Hungary has risen to prominence too. As a not entirely unexpected spanner in the works of EU sanctions. Prime Minister Victor Orban, known for his good relations with Mr Putin, is holding the EU hostage over plans for oil sanctions. Refusing to sign on the dotted line until his Russian-energy dependent country gets a favourable deal. Projecting a united and determined Western front against Mr Putin is of paramount importance to the EU and Nato right now. But neither Paris nor Berlin have been able to rein in Mr Orban. The European Commission President flew to Budapest on Monday night to try - to no avail. Of course keeping 27 countries united on sanctions when each one is impacted in a different way is a huge challenge and this is interpreted by Mr Putin as a weakness. Think back to the eurozone and, specifically, the Greek debt crisis. Angela Merkel would bash EU heads together, or at least keep them in the same room until a solution was found. She wasn't loved for that but she was respected. Now Brussels is beginning to ask whether the EU rule that foreign policy decisions, including sanctions packages, must be unanimous is now outdated in these unpredictable and dangerous times. "

In a speech to the EU's parliament in Strasbourg, he instead suggested Ukraine could join a ""parallel European community"" while it awaited a decision. This would allow non-EU members to join Europe's security architecture in other ways, said President Macron. His words came as fierce fighting continued in the eastern Donbas region, where Russia is trying to make gains. A senior US defence official characterised the Russian advance as ""single-digit kilometre kind of progress"". A Ukrainian leader in the Luhansk region said serious battles were taking place. In other developments on Monday: Ukraine began the process of applying to join the EU in February this year, four days after Russia's invasion. ""We all know perfectly well that the process to allow [Ukraine] to join would take several years indeed, probably several decades,"" Mr Macron said. He added: ""That is the truth, unless we decide to lower the standards for accession. And rethink the unity of our Europe."" Mr Macron said a ""parallel European community"" should be considered instead, rather than suspending the EU's strict membership criteria to fast-track Ukraine's application. He said it would be ""a way of anchoring countries which are geographically in Europe and share our values"". His comments came shortly after European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced the EU's executive would be publishing its initial opinion on Ukraine's bid for membership in June. Kyiv officials confirmed on Monday that Ukraine had submitted the second part of its EU membership application to Brussels. It normally takes years for countries to negotiate EU membership, with candidates having to prove that they meet multiple criteria - from respecting democracy and the rule of law to having a robust enough economy. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky has suggested the EU use a special procedure to grant Ukraine immediate membership of the bloc, but this has not happened. Later on Monday, the French president made his first foreign visit since re-election to Berlin, for talks with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz on the EU's response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Speaking at a press conference before the meeting, Mr Scholz said Russia's war of aggression had made co-operation between Paris and Berlin even more important. ""This is something that shocks us but also welds us together because we must act together,"" he said. ""It cannot be the case that borders in Europe can be moved around with violence."" The EU is trying to agree a sixth package of sanctions on Russia, including a phased ban on imports of oil, with longer delays for some landlocked states in Central Europe. However, Hungary has refused to back the oil embargo, describing it as an ""atomic bomb"" for its economy. Ms von der Leyen travelled to Budapest on Monday in an attempt to resolve the deadlock. After talks she said that ""we made progress, but further work is needed"". "
314,https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-trending-61351342,2022-05-09T23:20:07,Ukraine war: The stolen faces used to promote Vladimir Putin," Indian influencer ER Yamini has never tweeted in her life - she prefers to cultivate her big fan bases on Instagram and YouTube. But in early March, a Twitter account using her picture tweeted: ""#IStandWithPutin. True Friendship"" accompanied by a video showing two men hugging - one representing India, the other, Russia. Yamini says she doesn't support either country in the Russia-Ukraine war, and worries about her fans. ""If they see that tweet, what will they think about me?"" she asks, ""I wish they wouldn't use my photo on that profile."" The fake account is part of a network promoting Russian president Vladimir Putin on Twitter, which used the hashtags #IStandWithPutin and #IStandWithRussia on 2 and 3 March. This led to trending topics in different regions - particularly in the global south, apparently showing support for the war, in countries including India, Pakistan, South Africa and Nigeria. Part of the activity tracked was organic - in other words, produced by real people - reflecting genuine support in some countries for Mr Putin and Russia. But many other profiles appear to have been inauthentic. They retweeted messages in high quantities, produced few original messages, and were created very recently. ""They were likely produced by bots, fake profiles or compromised accounts, artificially amplifying support for Putin in these countries,"" says Carl Miller, co-founder of CASM Technology, a company that researches online harms and disinformation. It tracked 9,907 profiles promoting support for Russia on 2 and 3 March, in several different languages. CASM found more than 1,000 of those accounts had spam-like characteristics. The BBC investigated hundreds of these seemingly inauthentic profiles. Our research confirms Mr Miller's thinking - they try to pass as genuine, but in fact are fake. Through reverse image searching, we have found that pictures used by these profiles were copied from celebrities, influencers and ordinary users, who had no idea their images were being used to support Russia in its war against Ukraine. We have not been able to determine who set up the accounts, or whether they have any connection to the Russian government. An account named Preety Sharma, for example, states in its bio that they are a ""model and entrepreneur"" originally from India, now in Miami. It was created on 26 February, two days after Russia's invasion. ""Putin is a good person"", says one of its retweets. But the woman depicted in the account's profile picture is in the other side of the world. Nicole Thorne is an Australian social media influencer who has 1.5 million followers on Instagram, and only occasionally uses her original profile on Twitter. Another account tries to pass as Indian singer Raja Gujjar. Its first tweet was posted on 24 February, the first day of the invasion. And all 178 posts by the account are retweets, a strong indicator of automation. The BBC contacted Ms Thorne and Mr Gujjar, and both confirmed these accounts weren't theirs. Although very bot-like, not all accounts investigated were inauthentic. Take one profile, created in February 2022 with tweets starting on 2 March. It has no followers. Reverse searching its profile picture, the BBC came across a young Indian man's account on LinkedIn. But it's authentic, and set up by Senthil Kumar, an aeronautical engineer. We asked why he created an account just to retweet pro-Russia messages. ""Usually, I open Twitter and see what is trending. So I saw these posts and just retweeted them,"" he said. He believes Russia has supported India in the past, and Indians should now support Russia. And his profile was new, he said, because he had forgotten the password of his previous account. The accounts tweet a mixture of criticism of Western countries, express solidarity between the so-called Brics countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa), and offer direct support to Mr Putin. ""We default to the idea that information campaigns will be directed to the West. Yet none of the accounts were addressing the West nor claimed to be from the West,"" says Mr Miller. To identify what might be a group of inauthentic accounts, he adds, researchers look at accounts' creation dates, an ""inhuman"" tweeting pattern (such as an account tweeting 24 hours a day), and the range of topics tweeted. ""None of these things are a smoking gun, but they all add up together to allow us to see if a given community of accounts look like it's suspicious,"" says Mr Miller. The lack of a genuine profile picture can also be a telltale sign. Out of a sample of 100 accounts tracked by CASM, the BBC found that 41 had no profile pictures. Another 30 had illustrations or pictures of personalities like Mr Putin or Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg. Only a quarter had pictures depicting people - and some of those were stolen. Twitter prohibits the impersonation of ""individuals, groups, or organisations to mislead, confuse, or deceive others"". The company told us that since the war began, it has removed more than 100,000 accounts for violations of its platform manipulation and spam policy, including the suspension of dozens of accounts connected with the hashtags #IStandWithRussia and #IStandWithPutin. Twitter says it has investigated and suspended hundreds of the accounts pointed out by CASM's research and sent to the platform by the BBC, including 11 out of 12 accounts specifically flagged by us for using other people's profile pictures. But it said it found no evidence of widespread co-ordination to artificially amplify sentiment around the Ukraine war. "

Flanked by his military top brass in Moscow's iconic Red Square, he compared the invasion of Ukraine to the Soviet Union's defeat of Germany in World War Two - the theme of the day's celebrations. ""You are fighting for the Motherland, for its future, so that no one forgets the lessons of World War Two,"" he said to thousands of soldiers assembled before their annual victory day parade. Mr Putin also described Ukrainians as fascists and repeated his false claim that Kyiv is overrun by neo-Nazis. You can read the BBC's fact-check of the Russian leader's remarks here. But if you were looking for any clues of Mr Putin's broader strategy, our Russia Editor Steve Rosenberg suggests you won't find them in his speech today. The comments were delivered 75 days on since the president first ordered the invasion to go ahead, with Russia making few territorial advances in recent weeks. Today there was fierce fighting in Ukrainian towns in the eastern Luhansk region, where yesterday the town of Popasna fell to Russian forces after weeks of fighting. Responding to Mr Putin's Victory Day speech, a UK minister has said you cannot compare Russia's invasion of Ukraine with its defeat of Nazi Germany in World War Two. If anything Vladimir Putin's Russia is ""mirroring the fascism and tyranny of 77 years ago, repeating the errors of last century's totalitarian regimes,"" Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said. And it is not just the Russian leader who must be held to account, Mr Wallace added. His inner circle and top military generals also at today's Victory Day event are ""utterly complicit in Putin's hijacking of their forebears' proud history."" It will take years if not decades for Ukraine to be accepted as a member of the European Union, French President Emmanuel Macron has said. ""That is the truth, unless we decide to lower the standards for accession and rethink the unity of our Europe."" Instead of allowing countries to join the bloc immediately, the EU should consider the possibility of creating a ""parallel European community"" that countries like Ukraine could join and still benefit from Europe's security architecture. Pro-Ukraine activists protesting the war sprayed Russia's ambassador to Poland with red liquid while he was visiting a Soviet military cemetery in Warsaw. The protesters told local media that the liquid symbolised the Ukrainian blood shed since the invasion began. Russia's foreign ministry has lodged a formal complaint and wants the Polish government to re-organise a new wreath laying ceremony with better protection for its diplomats. On the international stage Ukraine's leadership has displayed a united resolve against the Russian invasion that appears robust. But among residents of one town in the eastern Donbas not far from some of the most intense fighting, there is division and dissent beneath the surface. Capture by Russian forces would ""make no difference to me,"" an elderly Bakhmut resident tells the BBC's Andrew Harding. Others including Sveltana disagree: ""Karma will quickly catch up with them,"" she says of her neighbours who've been supporting Russia. "

Joseph Kleijnen, who lives in East Yorkshire, flew to Amsterdam on 22 March to collect Andrii, whose parents are both military doctors in Ukraine. He said they had no response from the Home Office since submitting a visa application in Holland on 24 March. The Home Office said it was ""processing visas as quickly as they come in"". Andrii fled the country alone hours after bombs landed near his hometown of Volodymyr-Volynskyi, in the north-west of Ukraine, the same day Mr Kleijnen, 59, and his wife Jeanette, 56, applied to sponsor him under the Homes4Ukraine scheme. Andrii said: ""It's scary, because when missiles hit 2km away from my home and the house was shaking, I just packed my things and departed at 2am, the same day the scheme started. ""I never imagined that my first trip abroad would be like this. ""You don't know what will happen in five minutes, or in an hour or in a day, and especially now, I have no clue what will happen to [me], my parents and my eight-year-old sister who are left there. ""We cannot predict what will happen but it's not a situation you want to be in."" Mr and Mrs Kleijnen, who live in Sunk Island and were appointed as Andrii's guardians, said they thought the visa application would be processed quicker in the Netherlands than in Ukraine's neighbouring country, Poland. ""When we first contacted Andrii, he was staying in the cellar of his house because the raid alarms were going off. He couldn't sleep and was in a poor mental state,"" said Mr Kleijnen, a semi-retired physician and professor who has dual British and Dutch nationality. ""At the moment we are just moving from accommodation to accommodation and we don't know what's happening because the Home Office hasn't said a word. They do not communicate with us. ""We have no idea why and that's very frustrating on top of the stress that is already there."" Mrs Kleijnen, originally from Blackburn, Lancashire, said: ""I just feel completely helpless. I can see Andrii needs support, he needs to be somewhere stable. ""There's a lot of uncertainty in his life and the little bit we can do to help is to give him some stability; to make sure he can carry on doing his studies, he can feel settled. ""But we can't do that at the moment and for someone fleeing a warzone, this is really the last thing they need."" The Kleijnens said they had contacted their local MP Graham Stuart, who also contacted the Home Office on their behalf, but has had no explanation for the delay. Hull-based Immigration lawyer, Jayne Mercer, from the charity Community Integration Advocacy Centre, is helping them. She said the case highlighted the problem currently being faced by more than 42,000 people from Ukraine. ""We are all frustrated by the lack of communications from the Home Office. This is just one case, but highlights the problem many people are facing,"" said Ms Mercer. Mrs Kleijnen said they were running out of options, but they were considering taking legal action against the Home Office. The Home Office said: ""The changes the Home Office has made to streamline the visa system, including simplifying the forms and boosting staff numbers, are working and we are now processing visas as quickly as they come in - enabling thousands more Ukrainians to come through our uncapped routes.""

319,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-61377886,2022-05-09T16:40:37,Putin says Russia fighting for motherland in Ukraine in Victory Day speech," Russian President Vladimir Putin said Russian forces in Ukraine were fighting for the future of their motherland, in his annual address marking victory over Nazi Germany in World War Two. Despite rumours he would make a major announcement his speech stuck largely to defending Russia's invasion. He tied the war in Ukraine to victory in 1945, blaming the West and Nato for rejecting security demands. Almost 10 weeks into the invasion, civilian casualties continue to mount. A Russian attack on a school on Sunday is thought to have claimed the lives of 60 civilians and Ukrainian towns in the Luhansk region came under further bombardment on Monday. Flanked by military top brass, Russia's leader spoke of Ukrainians as fascists, repeating his false claim that the democratic government in Kyiv was run by neo-Nazis. Defending the motherland had always been sacred, he said, referring to the eastern region which is now the main focus of Russia's assault: ""Today you are fighting for our people in Donbas, for the security of Russia, our homeland."" He also made unfounded allegations against Nato and Ukraine and described the invasion as a pre-emptive rebuff: ""They were preparing a punishing operation in Donbas to intrude on our historic lands. In Kyiv they were saying they might get nuclear weapons and Nato started exploring the lands close to us, and that became an obvious threat to us and our borders."" Ukrainian presidential official Mykhailo Podoliak later responded, tweeting that there were no rational grounds for the war: ""Nato countries were not going to attack Russia. Ukraine did not plan to attack Crimea."" There had been speculation that Russia's president may be considering a change of military strategy, either a full declaration of war, rather than the current so-called special military operation, or a mobilisation of Russian men to boost the armed forces. Instead he said he was signing a decree for families of the dead and wounded in Ukraine to receive special support. During a meeting later in the day with the father of a serviceman killed in eastern Ukraine, he said everything was going according to plan and the ""result will be achieved"". There was a minute of silence, including for the fallen in Ukraine, and he ended his 11-minute address with the words: ""Glory to our armed forces - for Russia, for victory, hurrah"", at which the assembled forces responded with a big cheer. The parade was more modest than in recent years. Russian news agencies said 11,000 troops and 131 armoured vehicles took part in the event, including Russia's widely feted Armata tanks, which have not been considered combat-ready for the war in Ukraine. There was no sign of chief of staff Valery Gerasimov, who according to some unconfirmed reports may have been wounded on a recent visit to the front line in Donbas. Not everything went according to plan. A flypast by the air force had to be cancelled shortly before the parade because of ""weather conditions"", according to the Kremlin. Ahead of Victory Day, warplanes had rehearsed over Red Square in a Z-formation, the motif used by the Russian state during its war in Ukraine. Smaller parades took part in cities across Russia and the weather was also blamed for similar cancellations of flypasts in Yekaterinburg, Rostov and Novosibirsk. There was no mention in Vladimir Putin's speech of Mariupol, the southern Ukrainian port city where a small group of Ukrainian forces continue to hold out in a maze of tunnels under the Azovstal steelworks. Ukrainian officials said Russian forces were trying to storm the plant backed up by tank and artillery fire. But Russia was able to claim limited success on Monday in Kherson, the one Ukrainian city it can claim to have fully occupied. State-run news agency Ria Novosti showed footage of a Victory Day march in memory of those who died in the war. It was led by Volodymyr Saldo, a pro-Russian local official who has been named Kherson governor and is now being investigated for treason by Ukraine. What was then the Soviet Union lost 27 million lives during World War Two, with Ukraine accounting for eight million of them. In a separate message marking 9 May, President Volodymyr Zelensky said Nazis had been expelled in 1945 and Ukraine would not allow anyone to ""annex this victory"". Very soon, he said, Ukraine would have two victory days to celebrate. Small acts of protest did take place in Russia. Programme guides on smart TVs were hacked with an anti-war message saying ""on your hands is the blood of thousands of Ukrainians"". The front page of news website Lenta was also sabotaged with 10 detailed stories with headlines including ""Russia leaves the corpses of its soldiers in Ukraine"". In Poland, Russian ambassador Sergei Andreev was doused with red paint as he tried to lay a wreath at a military cemetery. "

Speaking as Russia staged a military parade marking the anniversary of the defeat of Nazi Germany, he accused Russian generals of hijacking their ""forebears' proud history"". Mr Wallace said the generals must face war crimes trials. The defence secretary said there ""can be no victory day, only dishonour"". He accused Russian President Vladimir Putin of ""ripping up both Russia's past and its future"". Mr Putin has been attending Russia's annual 9 May Victory Day parade in Moscow, as he attempts to rally public support for the war in Ukraine. The event commemorates the anniversary of the Soviet victory over the Nazis in 1945. While VE Day is marked on 8 May in most of Europe, the 1945 surrender was signed after midnight Russian time. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has accused Russia of forgetting everything that was important to the victors. In a speech at the National Army Museum, Mr Wallace said: ""Putin, his inner circle and generals are now mirroring the fascism and tyranny of 77 years ago, repeating the errors of last century's totalitarian regimes."" He continued: ""So let's call out the absurdity of Russian generals - resplendent in their manicured parade uniforms and weighed down by their many medals - for being utterly complicit in Putin's hijacking of their forebears' proud history of defending against a ruthless invasion, of repelling fascism, of sacrificing themselves for a higher purpose. ""Instead now, they are the ones inflicting needless suffering in the service of lowly gangsterism."" He said the Russian army's actions ""dishonour"" the country's World War Two fighters and called for Russian generals to face court martial over their actions during Russia's ""illegal invasion"". Mr Wallace pointed to attacks on civilians, the targeting of women and children and instances of sexual violence. He said all professional soldiers ""should be appalled"" at the Russian army's behaviour. Speaking at a separate event at King's College London later, Mr Wallace said Russia's ""brutality"" in Ukraine could send an ""incredibly dangerous"" message if Mr Putin was successful. The defence secretary said if a country won a war after its military had committed murder and rape, and bombed civilian territories, it would indicate to powers around the world that they ""just need to be more brutal"" than others to achieve their aims. ""If Putin is successful in Ukraine, then watch out,"" he said. Pointing to the Ukrainian city of Mariupol, Mr Wallace said Russia was ""not interested in occupying"" the area and had simply been destroying it. Russia began its invasion of Ukraine on 24 February, describing it as a ""special military operation"" which aimed to ""demilitarise and de-Nazify Ukraine"". Mr Putin has said he wants to protect people after what he described as eight years of bullying and genocide from Ukraine's government. The claims are completely unfounded but part of a narrative repeated by Russia for years. Speaking during the Moscow parade, Mr Putin claimed the West had been ""preparing for the invasion of our land, including Crimea"". But Mr Wallace denied the West intended to invade, saying the Russian president had been making ""fairy-tale claims for months"". He said while Mr Putin claimed to be ""surrounded"", countries in the Nato military alliance accounted for only 6% of Russia's land border. The defence secretary said Mr Putin ""is believing what he wants to believe"", adding: ""Let me put on the record categorically: Nato, Britain, Eastern Europe is not planning to invade Russia and never has done."" The prime minister's spokesman said the UK would continue to provide Ukraine with military and financial support and that the government was ""in this for the long haul"". However, the spokesman said that the UK was not looking for regime change in Russia, but is ""focused on getting Putin to change course in Ukraine"". Speaking in a recorded address posted on Twitter, Boris Johnson said he has ""never been more certain that Ukraine will win"". The prime minister said: ""As we celebrate victory over fascism in the Second World War, a great European nation is fighting for survival against a brutal invasion."" Mr Johnson said Ukraine has the UK's ""unflinching support"" and that Ukrainians ""ask for nothing except to live in peace and freedom in their own land"". Meanwhile, the UK has announced a fresh package of sanctions on Russia and Belarus, targeting £1.7bn of trade. The Department for International Trade said new import tariffs would apply to goods including platinum and palladium - used to make parts for mobile phones and computers. Export bans will also target chemicals, plastics, rubber and machinery. It takes the value of products subject to UK sanctions to more than £4bn. "
321,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-56720589,2022-05-09T15:34:39,Why has Russia invaded Ukraine and what does Putin want?," Vladimir Putin unleashed the biggest war in Europe since World War Two with the justification that modern, Western-leaning Ukraine was a constant threat and Russia could not feel ""safe, develop and exist"". Thousands of people have since died, towns and cities such as Mariupol lie in ruins and 13 million people have been displaced. But the questions remain: what was it all for and how will it end? The Russian leader's initial aim was to overrun Ukraine and depose its government, ending for good its desire to join the Western defensive alliance Nato. After a month of failures, he abandoned his bid to capture the capital Kyiv and turned his ambitions to Ukraine's east and south. Launching the invasion on 24 February he told the Russian people his goal was to ""demilitarise and de-Nazify Ukraine"". His declared aim was to protect people subjected to what he called eight years of bullying and genocide by Ukraine's government. Another objective was soon added: ensuring Ukraine's neutral status . Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov spoke of freeing Ukraine from oppression while foreign intelligence chief Sergei Naryshkin argued ""Russia's future and its future place in the world are at stake"". Ukraine's democratically elected president, Volodymyr Zelensky, said ""the enemy has designated me as target number one; my family is target number two"". His adviser said Russian troops made two attempts to storm the presidential compound. Russia's leader refused to call it an invasion or a war. Moscow continues to coin Europe's biggest war since 1945 a ""special military operation"". The claims of Nazis and genocide in Ukraine are completely unfounded but part of a narrative repeated by Russia for years. ""It's crazy, sometimes not even they can explain what they are referring to,"" complained Ukraine's foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba. However, an opinion piece by state-run news agency Ria Novosti made clear that ""denazification is inevitably also de-Ukrainisation"" - in effect erasing the modern state. And it is Russia that is now accused by the international community of carrying out war crimes. Several countries including the US and Canada go further and call it genocide. After so much destruction, the Russian leader's words ring very hollow now: ""It is not our plan to occupy the Ukrainian territory; we do not intend to impose anything on anyone by force."" A month into the invasion, Russia pulled back from Kyiv and declared its main goal was the ""liberation of Donbas"" - broadly referring to Ukraine's eastern regions of Luhansk and Donetsk. More than a third of this area was already seized by Russian proxy forces in a war that began in 2014, now Russia wanted to conquer all of it. The Kremlin claimed it had ""generally accomplished"" the aims of the invasion's first phase, which it defined as considerably reducing Ukraine's combat potential. But it became clear from Russia's withdrawal that it had scaled back its ambitions. ""Putin needs a victory,"" said Andrei Kortunov, head of the Russian International Affairs Council. ""At least he needs something he can present to his constituency at home as a victory."" Russian officials are now focused on seizing the two big eastern regions and creating a land corridor along the south coast, east from Crimea to the Russian border. They have claimed control of the southern region of Kherson and a leading Russian general has said they have hopes of seizing territory further west along the Black Sea coast towards Odesa and beyond. ""Control over the south of Ukraine is another way out to Transnistria,"" said Maj Gen Rustam Minnekayev, referring to a breakaway area of Moldova, where Russia has some 1,500 troops. If Russia does capture both eastern regions, it will most likely try to annexe them after a sham vote, as it did with Crimea in 2014. Ukraine also accuses occupying forces in Kherson of planning a referendum on creating separatist entity: they are already introducing Russia's currency, the rouble, from 1 May. Capturing Donbas and the land corridor is a mandatory minimum for the Kremlin, warns Tatiana Stanovaya, of analysis firm RPolitik and the Carnegie Moscow Center: ""They will keep going. I always hear the same phrase - 'we have no choice but to escalate'."" The powerful head of Russia's security council, Nikolai Patrushev, has spoken of Ukraine disintegrating into ""several states"", blaming Ukrainian and Western hatred of Russia. The question is whether Russian forces have the numbers to press forward. By not declaring this a war, the Kremlin cannot mobilise nationally and military analyst Michael Kofman believes unless that happens Russia's Donbas offensive is the last it can attempt. There is little sign of any negotiated end to this war in the immediate future. A few weeks into the war, Russia said it was considering a Ukrainian proposal of neutrality, but there have been no negotiations since the end of March. President Putin told the UN Secretary General at the end of April ""we are negotiating, we do not reject [talks]"", but he earlier declared negotiations at a dead end. After a meeting with the Russian leader, Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer gave a very downbeat assessment of a man who had entered into a ""logic of war"". Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky had already accepted that Ukraine would not join Nato: ""It's a truth and it must be recognised."" But after apparent Russian atrocities came to light in Bucha, Mariupol and elsewhere, he made it clear there would be no more talks until Russia withdrew from all territories seized since 24 February. In its offer of neutrality proposed at the end of March, Kyiv said: But neutrality for Vladimir Putin was never likely to be enough. ""Ultimately [Putin] wanted to divide the country and I think it's becoming more evident that's what he wants,"" says Barbara Zanchetta of King's College London's Department of War Studies. While the Kremlin wants to annex some areas of Ukraine, Tatiana Stanovaya believes ""much more important is the fate of Ukraine: Putin wants to end Ukraine as a current state"". Since Ukraine achieved independence in 1991, as the Soviet Union collapsed, it has gradually looked to the West - both the EU and Nato. Russia's leader has sought to reverse that, seeing the fall of the Soviet Union as the ""disintegration of historical Russia"". He has claimed Russians and Ukrainians are one people, denying Ukraine its long history and seeing today's independent state merely as an ""anti-Russia project"". ""Ukraine never had stable traditions of genuine statehood,"" he asserted. It was his pressure on Ukraine's pro-Russian leader, Viktor Yanukovych, not to sign a deal with the European Union in 2013 that led to protests that ultimately ousted the Ukrainian president in February 2014. Russia then seized Ukraine's southern region of Crimea and triggered a separatist rebellion in the east and a war that claimed 14,000 lives. As he prepared to invade in February, he tore up an unfulfilled 2015 Minsk peace deal and accused Nato of threatening ""our historic future as a nation"", claiming without foundation that Nato countries wanted to bring war to Crimea. He has lately accused Nato of using Ukraine to wage a proxy war against Russia. For Russia's leader the West's 30-member defensive military alliance has one aim - to split society in Russia and ultimately destroy it. In a Victory Day speech on 9 May he accused Nato of launching an active military build-up on territories adjacent to Russia. Ahead of the war, he demanded that Nato turn the clock back to 1997 and reverse its eastward expansion, removing its forces and military infrastructure from member states that joined the alliance from 1997 and not deploying ""strike weapons near Russia's borders"". That means Central Europe, Eastern Europe and the Baltics. In President Putin's eyes, the West promised back in 1990 that Nato would expand ""not an inch to the east"", but did so anyway. That was before the collapse of the Soviet Union, however, so the promise made to then Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev only referred to East Germany in the context of a reunified Germany. Mr Gorbachev said later that ""the topic of Nato expansion was never discussed"" at the time. And the context in the 1990s was very different, says Barbara Zanchetta: ""It was not done as a provocation, there was a partnership for peace."" Nato maintains it never intended to deploy combat troops on its eastern flank, until Russia annexed Crimea illegally in 2014. If he has, his military setbacks in Ukraine may have put paid to any wider ambitions beyond its borders. The most immediate threat is to Moldova, which is not part of Nato and has already come under Russian threat. But President Putin's ambition to roll Nato back to the late 1990s has taken a hit, with Finland and Sweden looking closely at joining an alliance that now seems as unified as ever. ""He has triggered the opposite effect of what he wanted. He wanted to weaken Nato but Nato is now much stronger,"" says Barbara Zanchetta. Nato has warned of a war that could last weeks, months or even years, and said its members need to be prepared for a long haul. Russia has already punished two Nato members, Poland and Bulgaria, for the West's support for Ukraine, by cutting off their gas supplies. Having witnessed Mr Putin's willingness to lay waste to European cities to achieve his aims, Western leaders are now under no illusion. US President Joe Biden has labelled him a war criminal and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz believes ""Putin wants to build a Russian empire... he wants to fundamentally redefine the status quo within Europe in line with his own vision."" Russia has tried to silence dissent. Protest of any kind is banned and more than 15,000 people have been detained. ""The Russian people will always be able to distinguish true patriots from scum and traitors,"" said President Putin. There has been a big exodus of IT workers and other professionals and the political opposition has either fled or been jailed, as in the case of opposition leader Alexei Navalny. A wide array of Western sanctions threaten to contract Russia's economy by up to 10% this year and hike inflation by more than 20%: "

325,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-61372382,2022-05-09T11:59:32,"Ukraine war: 'When the shelling stops, the traitors will be punished'"," A clash of loyalties is dividing opinion among residents in Bakhmut - a town on the front line in eastern Ukraine's Donbas region. Sometimes it slips out as a whisper. More often, it is hidden behind euphemisms and shrugs - and carefully ambivalent replies. And then, once in a while, a fiercely pro-Russian sentiment is simply blurted out, like the crack of a gunshot, here in the rolling green hills of the Donbas. ""This is Russian territory. Ukraine is the occupier here,"" said a man in overalls, standing with a group of council workers. They had been clearing weeds in Bakhmut - a Ukrainian town currently within easy earshot of Russian artillery. And the man was not alone in his apparent contempt for Ukraine's territorial integrity. Beside him, 65-year-old Yelena merely couched her views in more ambiguous terms. ""I don't know Putin personally, so I can't tell you what I think of him. But I don't see Russia as the enemy. We all lived together in the Soviet Union. So, let's see what happens [if Russia occupies the town],"" she said. The notion that Ukraine stands resolutely united in opposition to Russia's invasion may hold true for much for the country. But here in the Donbas, there is a large ethnic-Russian minority, a painful history of eight years of separatist conflict with Russian-backed militias and - particularly for an older generation - a powerful nostalgia for the USSR. The result is an increasingly fraught clash of loyalties, with at least some residents of Bakhmut - a key hub for people fleeing from the Luhansk region further east - unashamedly supportive of the latest Russian invasion. ""Putin is a clever guy, a clever KGB man,"" said an 80-year-old retired engineer, as she sat in the kitchen of a local cafeteria peeling potatoes. If Russians seized the town, it would ""make no difference to me,"" she whispered, before falling quiet when a colleague came into the room. ""I'm a creation of the Soviet Union. We all lived together in those days and I have relatives everywhere. I'm not going to tell you what I think of Putin,"" said another elderly ethnic-Russian woman who was part of the work group preparing to plant rows of young trees at the entrance to Bakhmut. Some Ukrainians here have brushed aside these pro-Russian comments as the harmless grumblings of an out-of-touch generation - of a handful of elderly pensioners who are reluctant to leave their homes, and whose opinions are unlikely to have any significant impact on the course of this war. But in other parts of Ukraine, recently liberated from Russian occupation, there is evidence that collaborators may have actively assisted the Kremlin's troops. And today, in front-line towns like Bakhmut, there are concerns that pro-Russian sentiment could pose a real risk, particularly if it is shared by officials in local administrations. ""These guys are trying to have it both ways - win or lose,"" said a local businessman, Dmytro Kononets, describing what he claimed was the attitude of some figures in the town council. He contrasted the relatively low-key public comments of the town's Mayor, Reva Oleksiy, to the loudly defiant tone struck by many of Ukraine's younger regional governors and public officials, and asked why the council was busy employing people to dig up weeds when they could be digging trenches instead. ""Obviously, they don't really want to prevent [Russia from seizing the town]. It's like they're just pretending. It's just ridiculous,"" said Kononets, adding that he knew many locals who got all their news from Russian television and believed ""that nonsense"". But the council's supporters said such suspicions were misplaced. They defend the beautification campaign being carried out on the town's streets as a inspiring and defiant display of business-as-usual in the face of Russian aggression. ""This is our form of resistance,"" one of the council workers involved told us. ""The mayor is firmly pro-Ukrainian, without doubt,"" said a town councillor, who nonetheless asked that we not print his name. The mayor himself declined to give an interview. He has held the same post for more than 30 years. His deputy, Maxim Sutkovyi, dismissed suggestions that the mayor might be less than loyal to Ukraine as ""beneath contempt"". ""Bakhmut is part of Ukraine. Our job is to protect daily life here, to keep doing our jobs and not collapse into hysterics. No doubt there are [collaborators] here, but it is up to the security services to root them out,"" said Sutkovyi. While most families in Bakhmut have already left the town, following official advice, there are plenty of local volunteers, in uniform, who have stayed on to fight any Russian attack. ""We'll defend this place to the death,"" said one farmer, Slava, who joined the home guard and was busy loading supplies into his car to take to colleagues manning trenches on the edge of town. But with air raid sirens wailing across the town, Russian forces poised to take full control of Popasna, 30km (19 miles) to the east - and the Russians also pushing forwards from the north and the southeast - it is no surprise that old suspicions and new tensions are surging here. ""Karma will quickly catch up with them,"" said Svetlana Kravchenko, 57, of anyone in Bakhmut who supported the Russian offensive. She helps run a small charity collecting food and other supplies to distribute to the town's soldiers and to elderly civilians in the surrounding villages. Their basement office is also home to a Ukrainian Orthodox Church, where she and others pray daily. Most of the more traditional churches in Bakhmut are still officially linked to the Russian Orthodox church, whose leadership has publicly endorsed President Putin's invasion. ""Everyone makes their own choice. And they will have to answer for that. Maybe some people here want to surrender [to the Russians]. But when this conflict is over, when the shelling and shooting stops, then the traitors will be punished, either in this world or the next,"" said Kravchenko. "

Was Vladimir Putin preparing a major announcement on Russia's offensive in Ukraine? Would he declare some kind of victory? Or signal an escalation? In the end, he did neither. In his Red Square address to Russian troops - and the Russian nation - the Kremlin leader repeated his frequently voiced justification for attacking Ukraine: an argument that appears to blame everyone but Russia for what's happening. He criticised (as usual) America, Nato and the government in Kyiv, claiming that their actions had put the security of Russia itself in danger. He made references (as usual) to ""neo-Nazis"" in Ukraine. We hear that a lot from Russian officials, who regularly voice the baseless claim that Ukraine has been overrun by fascists, ultra-nationalists and Nazi sympathisers. President Putin admitted that Russia had suffered military losses, but he gave no details. The last official figures released by Russia's defence ministry were 1,351 Russian soldiers killed. But that was six weeks ago. There has been no update since. Curiously, Mr Putin didn't employ his familiar phrase - ""Special Military Operation"" - to describe Russia's offensive. Neither did he call it a war. But he tried to draw parallels between current hostilities and World War Two. An attempt, perhaps, to mobilise patriotic sentiment over Hitler's defeat to boost support amongst the Russian public for the invasion of Ukraine. Following the speech, thousands of Russian soldiers marched across Red Square, although there were fewer troops here than in last year's Victory Day parade. Military hardware was put on show, too. But a planned military fly-over was cancelled, officially due to poor weather. The Kremlin had been expecting a swift victory in Ukraine, possibly within days of sending in its troops. It didn't happen. Many here believe President Putin's Plan B was to secure a victory by 9 May. That hasn't happened, either. Where does President Putin go from here? There were few clues in today's speech. But there was no signalling of an end to hostilities. For now, they will continue. "

The Department for International Trade said new import tariffs will apply to goods including platinum and palladium. The metals are used to make parts for mobile phones and computers Export bans will target chemicals, plastics, rubber and machinery. It takes the value of products subject to UK sanctions to more than £4bn. The new import tariffs will cover £1.4bn of goods while the planned export bans are intended to impact products worth more than £250m in sectors of the Russian economy most dependent on UK goods. The announcement came after G7 leaders held a video call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and the US and Canada also imposed new sanctions. International Trade Secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan said: ""We are determined to do our utmost to thwart Putin's aims in Ukraine and undermine his illegal invasion, which has seen barbaric acts perpetrated against the Ukrainian people. ""This far-reaching package of sanctions will inflict further damage on the Russian war machine."" Chancellor Rishi Sunak said: ""Putin's illegal invasion of Ukraine is causing suffering on an enormous scale. His barbaric war must be stopped."" He said the new import and export sanctions would do ""significant damage to Putin's war effort"". This third round of trade sanctions announced by the UK government - excluding gold and energy - would see more than 96% of goods imports from Russia hit by restrictions and more than 60% of goods exports to Russia under whole or partial restrictions, said the DIT. The latest move comes as Russia celebrates Victory Day, the commemoration of the Soviet Victory over Nazi Germany in 1945, which is being marked with the annual military parade in Moscow's Red Square, despite many forces being deployed in Ukraine. The war in Ukraine also means this year's event has taken on different significance, with Vladimir Putin's speech likely to be closely analysed. Western countries have introduced increasingly widespread sanctions against Russia - targeting individuals, banks, businesses and major state-owned enterprises, and exports, among others. Among the high-profile individuals to be targeted has been Roman Abramovich, the billionaire owner of Chelsea Football Club. Chris Weafer, senior partner at Moscow-based business consultancy Macro Advisory, said sanctions were now starting to have a visible effect. ""These latest sanctions, of themselves, are relatively modest, but of course they add to previous sanctions,"" he told the BBC's Today Programme. ""It is the accumulation of sanctions that really is having the impact on the economy."" Companies are unable to import vital components and spare parts and have used up inventories during the last two months, Mr Weafer said. Some firms were warning of job losses or temporary shutdowns. ""The broader impact on people's incomes and on retail sales and across the broader economy is now starting to be felt,"" he said. ""People have been faced with high, double-digit inflation for the last couple of months. And there's a great deal of uncertainty as to what's going to happen next, particularly with regards to job security and income."" The UK has excluded key Russian banks from the UK financial system, frozen the assets of all Russian banks, barred Russian firms from borrowing money, and placed limits on deposits Russians can make at UK banks. Other sanctions have been implemented by the US and the EU. And more than 1,000 international companies have either suspended trading in Russia, or withdrawn altogether - including McDonald's, Coca-Cola and Starbucks. Belarus has been targeted with the UK government saying its leader Alexander Lukashenko had aided and abetted Russia's invasion. "

Saeed Esmaeli, from Bristol, gave Ernest, 13, a pair of wrestling shoes as a welcome gift when he arrived. He then found out his 72-year-old dad is a veteran wrestler and coached in Vladimir Klitschko's boxing company. ""I was really surprised. What a legend we've accidentally welcomed,"" said Mr Esmaeli, who left Iran when he was 11. ""As a child of war myself I know how hard it is to leave home and fit into another culture. ""I will do my best to give them a sense of belonging."" Ernest and his family arrived on 1 April while his father came shortly afterwards on 1 May as he wanted to stay and fight in Ukraine, but was told he was too old. The teenager had been wrestling for three years in Ukraine so his cousin, who arranged their visas, contacted Mr Esmaeli to see if he could attend some of the sessions he teaches in Horfield in Bristol. Mr Esmaeli then found out a week later Ernest's dad, Vitaliy, was a veteran power lifting champion and a life long wrestler, and had coached a lot of boxing greats in Ukraine as well. He said: ""I didn't know about Ernest's dad, it was just a coincidence and I told him to just come along to a session. ""I realised the situation they were facing and welcomed them to the club. ""I've been through these problems myself trying to adapt to a new culture. I was a total outsider and it took me years to blend in, so I can see the type of challenges Ernest will face,"" he added. Ernest's cousin Natasha, who he has been living with in Bristol, said she was ""immensely grateful"" Ernest had been welcomed and given a friendship group via Mr Esmaeli. ""This is the first thing that Ernest was able to establish for himself in this country and it's a string that connects him to his past and life in Ukraine,"" she said. ""Instantly he's got friends in his wrestling team."" Follow BBC West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. Send your story ideas to: bristol@bbc.co.uk "

Patron, a Jack Russell terrier, was presented with the award by Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky at a ceremony in Kyiv. The two-and-a-half-year-old has been credited with helping minesweepers find more than 200 devices. He has also become something of a national hero, a symbol of Ukraine's resistance against Russia. ""I want to award those Ukrainian heroes who are already clearing our land of mines. And together with our heroes - a wonderful little sapper Patron who helps not only to neutralize explosives, but also to teach our children the necessary safety rules in areas where there is a mine threat,"" President Zelensky said during Sunday's ceremony. The conference was also attended by Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau who was visiting the country on Sunday, announcing that Canada would be sending more weapons and equipment to Ukraine. As Patron and his owner Myhailo Iliev were presented with their medals, Prime Minister Trudeau patted his pockets as if he was looking for dog treats. Patron has become a focal point of Ukrainian patriotism and regularly features in videos on official Ukrainian social media channels. He has inspired a number of artworks by fans across the country, ranging from illustrations to knitted animal replicas. Among them is a sketch of Patron urinating on a Russian missile wearing his signature safety vest. Another features Patron in front of two backgrounds - one half showing a grassy park next to a ball, while the other features the remnants of a bombed building. "

Karl Bushby, 53, from Hull, set off in 1998 and is now 26,000 miles (42,000km) into the 36,000-mile (58,000km) walk. The ex-paratrooper reached Turkmenistan, on the Iranian border, in 2019 but encountered visa problems, forcing him to put his expedition on hold. Since then Covid restrictions, the political situation between Iran and the US, and the war in Ukraine, have all delayed his progress. Speaking from Mexico, where he has been living for the past two-and-a-half years, Mr Bushby said: ""I have got to start moving again. It's the most difficult position I've been in on this expedition. It feels like I'm treading a wall of friction between the West and the East. I have to find a way through."" With Iran ""out of the question"", Mr Bushby looked to Russia - a country he has previously visited on his walk. ""Spring 2022 and the war in Ukraine kicked off,"" said Mr Bushby. ""So now Russia is off limits, too."" Mr Bushby believes the only viable option that remains involves swimming 160 miles (257km) across the Caspian Sea, from Kazakhstan to Azerbaijan. Under the rules he set himself prior to beginning the walk, Mr Bushby cannot use any form of transport. ""Swimming across the Caspian Sea is now Plan A,"" he said. ""I am looking to do this in summer 2023. I am going to spent the next year getting myself into the right condition. ""The Caspian Sea has been swum before but we're talking a handful of individuals who do this kind of extreme swimming. There are people who do this kind of swimming all the time. I am not one of them."" Mr Bushby said the crossing would probably take ""a month or so"" to complete and would be done in stages. He added: ""After Azerbaijan, I'm into Georgia. At that point, I'm on the home straight."" In March 2006, Mr Bushby and French adventurer Dimitri Kieffer crossed the Bering Strait on foot, trekking across a frozen 56-mile (90km) section in 15 days. While crossing the Russian border near the Chukotkan village of Uelen, the pair were detained by officials for not entering the country at a correct port of entry. Mr Bushby added: ""I was young and fit then. I'm now 53. Swimming this sort of distance, across the Caspian Sea, is going to take a lot of stamina."" "

Olena Florek, from Staffordshire, travelled to Warsaw to try to get a UK visa for brother Volodymyr. After waiting 24 hours for it to be processed, she then made her way to Lviv to meet her mother and brother. The Home Office said its visa processes had been streamlined to enable more Ukrainians to come to the UK. Mrs Florek's brother requires 24/7 care as he is paralysed from the neck down. He also has cerebral palsy and is unable to speak, after contracting meningitis as a young boy. ""When it is war, not many people talk about those with mental health [issues], people with disabilities, care homes; we don't hear or see or know, but they are there,"" said Mrs Florek. ""Nobody mentions about these people and their situation. ""Have they been abandoned? Can they drink water or [are they] just left at Russian soldiers' mercy? We know they show no mercy,"" said Mrs Florek. In April, BBC News reported on a disabled woman who was reunited with her nephew, who lives in the UK, after volunteers stepped in to bring the woman and the man's mother out of Ukraine. Mother-of-two Mrs Florek, 36, left her family as she said she had no choice but to fly to Warsaw on a ""whim"" as she could no longer ""just wait for someone's mercy"" at the Home Office, after waiting more than three weeks to hear about her brother's visa. ""I couldn't live with myself knowing I haven't done everything in my power to save my close family. He is my only brother and he is precious,"" she said. She said she had been told the delays were due to her brother not having a biometric passport, which was due to his severe disabilities. ""I needed to go and help. If I didn't help, nobody would help them,"" she added. While waiting for her brother's UK visa to be processed in Warsaw, Mrs Florek said she had felt ""broken and exhausted"" after spending a day trying to interpret and translate to help others applying. ""They are people who are dealing with trauma, desperation; people who have no money; people who've lost loved ones; people who've left them; people with nothing; people trying to find a sponsor, someone who can provide shelter."" The 36-year-old said there was ""a big gap"" and more needed to be done to find people who could speak fluent Ukrainian and English, adding many were relying on phone apps to communicate. Her family, who lived in a rural area south of Kyiv, made their journey through checkpoints and areas with a heavy military presence to get to Lviv, in western Ukraine. Mrs Florek said spending 24 hours in Lviv had been ""petrifying, not knowing if we would make it out"" as air raid sirens blared. She speaks several languages and was able to negotiate a place for her brother to travel to the Polish city of Krakow in an ambulance and a van. The family members then met Mrs Florek's husband for an 800-mile (1,200km), two-day trip back to Staffordshire in his van. Now their modest terraced house in Stafford is home to her, her 10-year-old son, teenage daughter, husband, mother and 45-year-old brother. Ms Florek said her mother Halyna hoped to return to Ukraine ""in a matter of weeks"" but had come to the realisation that was ""impossible"". ""She just cried today. ""My mum wanted to visit me here, she has never been here ever... They would say to me 'one day' but that is not what I wanted. Not the way it has happened,"" said Mrs Florek. A spokeswoman for the Home Office said: ""In response to Putin's barbaric invasion, we have launched one of the fastest and biggest visa schemes in UK history. ""In just five weeks, over 56,000 visas have been issued so people can rebuild their lives in the UK through the Ukraine Family Scheme and Homes for Ukraine. ""Our Ukraine schemes have reached a turning point, thanks to the changes we've made to streamline the visa system, including simplifying the forms and boosting staff. ""Around 3,500 applications have been processed a day in the last few days, enabling thousands more Ukrainians to come through our uncapped routes.""

The two first ladies met at a school in the border town of Uzhhorod. It was Mrs Zelenska's first appearance in public since the Russian invasion of Ukraine began on 24 February. The US imposed new sanctions - including visa curbs on 2,600 Russian and Belarusian individuals - in response to the Russian invasion. Three Russian TV stations and executives from Gazprombank were also sanctioned by Washington. Meanwhile, G7 leaders said they were committed to phasing out or banning Russian oil. The meeting between the two first ladies took place at a school which is currently being used as a temporary shelter for displaced people. Mrs Biden said she wanted ""to show that the people of the United States stand with the people of Ukraine"", adding that the war - now in its third month - had been ""brutal"" and had to stop. Mrs Zelenska said it had been a ""courageous act"" to visit Ukraine while it was at war. She added that the visit, on Mother's Day in Ukraine and in the US, was very symbolic. ""We feel your love and support during such an important day."" The two women later sat down and played with some of the dozens of children who are currently housed at the school, making tissue paper bears - the symbol of the local province. The announcement of new sanctions came after G7 leaders held a video call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. A senior US official said the new US sanctions would hit 27 Gazprombank executives. However, the measures do not freeze the firm's assets or outlaw transactions with it. It is unclear who is on the list of 2,600 Russian and Belarusian individuals to be hit with visa restrictions. The US announcement came at the end of a day of diplomatic events, which included visits to Ukraine by Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, the speaker of the German Bundestag and Mrs Biden. Mr Trudeau announced that Canada was sending new weapons and equipment for Ukraine's army, as well as imposing its own range of new sanctions on Russian individuals and companies. ""What Putin needs to understand is that the West is absolutely determined and resolved to stand against what he is doing,"" Mr Trudeau later told Reuters in an interview. ""His illegal war, his escalations, his crossing of red lines by choosing to further invade Ukraine means that we will do as a world everything we can to make sure that he loses."" The UK also announced a fresh package of sanctions on Russia and Belarus, targeting £1.7bn ($2.1bn) of trade. The EU is currently finalising a sixth round of sanctions on Russia but has so far been unable to agree on the measures, including a phased ban of Russian oil. Diplomats said Hungary was still preventing progress on finalising the measures. EU countries are split on how soon they can wind down dependence on Russian energy supplies. Europe gets about 40% of its natural gas from Russia. The new US and Canadian sanctions were announced on the eve of Victory Day in Russia, which celebrates the Soviet Union's victory over Nazi Germany. In a statement, the G7 denounced Russia's President Putin, saying that ""his actions bring shame on Russia and the historic sacrifices of its people"". "

Earlier, the governor of Luhansk region, Serhiy Haidai, said 90 people had been sheltering in the building in Bilohorivka, and 30 were rescued. Mr Haidai said a Russian plane had dropped the bomb on Saturday - Russia has not commented. Luhansk has seen fierce combat as Russian troops and separatist fighters seek to surround government forces. Much of the region has been under the control of Russia-backed separatists for the past eight years. Bilohorivka is close to the government-held city of Severodonetsk, where heavy fighting was reported in the suburbs on Saturday. One Ukrainian newspaper, Ukrayinska Pravda, says the village became a ""hot spot"" during fighting last week. The blast brought down the building which caught fire and it took firefighters three hours to extinguish the blaze, according to the governor, writing on Telegram. He said almost the entire village had been sheltering in the basement of the school. The final death toll would only be known when the rubble had been cleared, the governor said. The UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said he was ""appalled"" by the deadly attack, adding: ""civilians must always be spared in times of war"". Elsewhere in the country, Ukrainian fighters at a steelworks in the port of Mariupol have told the world they will not surrender to Russian forces and have appealed for help to evacuate their wounded. Russia has besieged the area for weeks, calling on defenders from the Azov battalion to lay down their arms. But in a live news conference from the partially destroyed plant, members of the battalion said they would not give in. One of them, Lt Illia Samoilenko, said: ""Surrender for us is unacceptable because we can't grant such a big gift to the enemy."" He added: ""We are basically dead men. Most of us know this. It's why we fight so fearlessly."" The fighters also criticised the Ukrainian government, saying it had failed in the defence of Mariupol. But President Volodymyr Zelensky hit back, saying Ukraine did not have the heavy weaponry needed to unblock the city and that it was his own diplomatic efforts that had secured the evacuation of all civilians trapped inside the steelworks. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), responsible for coordinating evacuations from Mariupol alongside the UN, said 170 civilians arrived in the relatively safe city of Zaporizhzhia from Mariupol on Sunday. In a statement, the international arm of the Red Cross said the four-day operation, which began on 5 May, ""included the evacuation of 51 civilians from Azovstal"". Earlier in May, around 500 people were evacuated from Azovstal and the Mariupol area to Zaporizhzhia, the ICRC said. Also on Sunday, in a speech commemorating World War Two, President Zelensky accused Russia of implementing ""a bloody reconstruction of Nazism"" and said the Russian army was replicating wartime ""atrocities"". Footage in the Ukrainian leader's video address showed him against a backdrop of destroyed residential buildings. At the same time, Western governments have continued to show their support for Ukraine's struggle. Later on Sunday, Ukraine's president held talks with G7 leaders - including US President Joe Biden and the UK's Boris Johnson - via video conference. After the meeting, the leaders pledged their continuing support to Ukraine and their determination to wean themselves off Russian oil supplies. Payments for Russian energy amount to millions of dollars each day and help fund Russia's war effort. The prime minister of Canada, Justin Trudeau, also met Mr Zelensky in person after making an unannounced visit to the town of Irpin, near Kyiv, that was ravaged by Russian forces early in the invasion. At a news conference afterwards, Mr Trudeau announced further military help for Ukraine. The speaker of the German Bundestag met Mr Zelensky in Kyiv on Sunday, too, while US First Lady Jill Biden crossed into Ukraine from Slovakia to meet Mr Zelensky's wife, Olena Zelenska. Since Russia's invasion began on 24 February, the UN has recorded at least 2,345 civilian deaths and 2,919 injured in Ukraine, the High Commissioner for Human Rights said in an update last month. Thousands of combatants are also believed to have been killed or injured on both sides. More than 12 million people are said to have fled their homes since the conflict began, with 5.7 million leaving for neighbouring countries and another 6.5 million people thought to be displaced inside the war-torn country itself.

Mr Trudeau visited Irpin, which came under heavy bombardment at the start of the invasion and was temporarily occupied by Russian forces. Mrs Biden met Ukraine's First Lady Olena Zelenska at a school in the border town of Uzhhorod, which is currently being used as temporary shelter for displaced people. U2 frontman Bono added his voice to support for Ukraine in its fight against the Russian invasion, performing an acoustic set in a hall of the Kyiv metro together with bandmate The Edge. In a speech commemorating the end of World War Two, President Zelensky said the Russian army was replicating Nazi ""atrocities"" during its invasion of his country. Mr Zelensky accused Russia of implementing ""a bloody reconstruction of Nazism"". ""Darkness has returned to Ukraine and it has become black and white again,"" he said in his video address. You can read more about President Zelensky's speech here. ""We thought those were our last minutes. It was extremely scary but we were lucky."" Elena is recalling the moment Russian troops started shelling, after she and a group of escapees passed through one of their checkpoints. After two months living in the basement of a kindergarten in the Russian-occupied town of Izyum in Ukraine, Elena spent two nerve-shredding days on the road to safety. She and her daughter were among 20 people in a convoy of vehicles heading away from Russian-controlled territory. They fled last Friday using a route organised by volunteers. ""All that time we were praying,"" said Elena, 52, recounting how they passed through numerous Russian checkpoints. The BBC's Sophie Williams and Olga Pona tell the story of two women. Railways are increasingly being targeted by Russian forces in the war in Ukraine, but one line close to Kyiv has been restored in just a month. A railway bridge that connected the once Russian-occupied towns of Irpin, Bucha and Borodyanka with the capital has now been rebuilt - a symbol of hope for devastated communities. The BBC's Kyiv correspondent James Waterhouse has been on the first train on the restored route. Whatever else Russia's Victory Day parade - on 9 May - is supposed to represent, it won't be any sort of victory over Ukraine, regardless of the spin President Vladimir Putin and the Kremlin will try to put on it, writes defence analyst Professor Michael Clarke. This war is one that Russia cannot win in any meaningful sense. Putin's foreign military successes around the world after 2008 were all achieved by using small units of elite forces, mercenaries and local militia groups alongside Russian air power. This gave Moscow considerable leverage at low cost during interventions in Georgia, Nagorno-Karabakh, Syria, Libya, Mali and twice in Ukraine during 2014, first in illegally annexing Crimea and then in creating self-declared Russian statelets in Luhansk and Donetsk. You can read Prof Clarke's analysis in full here. At a VE Day celebration in Berlin, Germany, a giant Ukrainian flag was rolled out, in defiance at a ban on the display of Russian and Ukrainian flags for the events to mark Nazi Germany's surrender on 8 May 1945. Police confiscated the flag, drawing criticism from Ukraine's foreign minister. "

Martin Holton brought the families into his mansion near Warwick after going on an aid mission to the Polish border. Sisters Tamara and Tetiana Zastryzhna, their family friend, and their five children, said they felt safe living in the UK. Mr Holton, who runs a car dealership, said: ""It feels nice, they're a great family."" The families arrived in the UK last month after applying for a visa in Poland. ""I have got the space, it is not being used,"" Mr Holton said. ""They haven't affected my life, they have probably enhanced my life in fairness, they make me feel better going to work every morning, it is a nice feeling."" He urged others to open up their homes if they were able, adding: ""It somebody is thinking about sponsoring, do it, it isn't an imposition in your life."" Sunday marked Mother's Day in Ukraine and the families are keeping in regular contact with relatives back home. Ms Zastryzhna said: ""We are happy we are here, now we are safe and have such beautiful and safe conditions to live. ""People are so kind so we are happy to live here."" The mothers said they were keen to find work while staying in the UK, but their number one wish was for the Russian invasion to end so they can return home.

In a speech commemorating World War Two, he said the Russian army was replicating Nazi ""atrocities"" during its invasion of his country. ""Darkness has returned to Ukraine and it has become black and white again,"" he said in his video address. Footage in the video showed the Ukrainian leader against a backdrop of destroyed residential buildings. ""Evil has returned, in a different uniform, under different slogans, but for the same purpose,"" he added. The video also featured archive footage of World War Two and black-and-white footage of Russia's invasion. When Ukraine was invaded by Russia in late February, Moscow maintained its operation was in part to ""de-Nazify"" the country. Russian President Vladimir Putin returned to the theme in his own address congratulating former Soviet nations on the 77th anniversary of Nazi Germany's defeat, saying that ""as in 1945, victory will be ours"". Ukrainian officials fear Russia may step up its attacks ahead of Russia's Victory Day commemorations on Monday. Mr Zelensky appealed to European nations, including the UK, France and the Netherlands, by likening Nazi bombings of their towns and cities to Russian strikes on urban areas in Ukraine. Meanwhile, more than 60 people are feared dead after a Russian bomb hit a school in eastern Ukraine on Saturday, local authorities said. The governor of Ukraine's Luhansk region, Serhiy Haidai, said around 90 local residents had been sheltering in the school in the village of Bilohorivka, near the frontline in the Donbas region. "

Russia has warned them not to. It has threatened ""a military technical response"" if they do. So, on balance, is Europe a safer or more dangerous place if either or both of these countries become a part of Nato? Nato - the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation - is a 30-nation defensive alliance founded shortly after the end of World War Two. It has its headquarters in Brussels but is dominated by the massive military and nuclear missile power of the US. Finland and Sweden are both modern, democratic countries that fulfil the criteria for Nato membership. The organisation's chief, Jens Stoltenberg, has said he would welcome them with open arms and there would be minimum delay in processing their membership. US Army Lt Gen (retd) Ben Hodges, who commanded all US land forces in Europe, is in no doubt of the benefits of this for the West: ""Sweden and Finland joining Nato is huge - a very positive development. They are two very strong democracies, and the military of both is very good, capable and modernised, with remarkable mobilisation systems."" In the case of Finland, a form of military integration is already under way. British tank crews recently went on exercise with a Finnish armoured brigade, together with US, Latvian and Estonian troops as part of Nato's so-called Joint Expeditionary Force (JEF). The UK's ministry of defence said the aim was to ""deter Russian aggression in Scandinavia and the Baltic states"". So, what is the problem if either or both countries want to join? Russia, and more specifically President Vladimir Putin, does not see Nato as a defensive alliance. Quite the opposite. He views it as a threat to Russia's security. He has watched in dismay as Nato steadily expanded eastwards - closer to Moscow - after the disintegration of the Soviet Union in 1991. When Putin was a young intelligence officer in the Soviet state security apparatus, the KGB, Moscow controlled all the countries of eastern Europe, with Russian troops stationed in most of them. Today, nearly all those countries have opted to look westwards and join Nato. Even the Baltic states - Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania - countries that were once, unwillingly, part of the Soviet Union, have joined the alliance. Only 6% of Russia's vast borders are with Nato countries, yet the Kremlin is feeling encircled and threatened. Shortly before President Putin sent his troops into Ukraine on 24 February, he demanded a redrawing of the security map of Europe. Nato troops, he insisted, should pull back from all of these eastern European countries, and no new countries should be allowed to join. His invasion has now resulted in the opposite. For decades, Finland and Sweden have carefully nurtured their neutrality. Culturally, they are firmly in the western camp, but until now they have been wary of antagonising their giant nuclear-armed neighbour, Russia. The Ukraine invasion prompted a radical rethink, with both government and people wondering if they might not be safer after all ""inside the tent"", sheltering under Nato's collective protection known as ""Article 5"". This views an attack on one member as an attack on all. A recent poll in Finland showed 62% of Finns in favour of joining. From a purely military perspective, the addition of Finland's and/or Sweden's substantial militaries would be a major boost to Nato's defensive power in the north of Europe, where it is massively outnumbered by Russia's forces. Finland, says Ben Hodges, brings F35 fighter jets, Sweden brings Patriot missile batteries and has re-secured its large Baltic island of Gotland, where Russia has recently been probing. The armed forces of both Finland and Sweden are experts in Arctic warfare, training intensively to fight and survive in the frozen forests of Scandinavia. When Russia invaded Finland in WW2, the Finns fought ferociously against the invaders, inflicting serious losses. Geographically, the addition of Finland fills in a huge gap in Nato's defence, doubling the amount of its border with Russia. Security and stability in the Baltic Sea, says Hodges, are now dramatically improved. Politically, it would add to the cohesion of western mutual defence, sending a signal to Putin that almost all of Europe is united against his invasion of a sovereign country, Ukraine. Put simply, the risk here is that such a major expansion of Nato, right on Russia's doorstep, alarms and enrages the Kremlin so much that it responds by lashing out in some form. When Putin threatened to take ""military technical measures"" in response this, it is widely taken to be two things - a reinforcing of its own borders by moving troops and missiles closer to the West, and possibly a stepping up of cyber attacks on Scandinavia. Staying neutral has served Sweden very well over the years. Giving up that neutrality is not to be taken lightly. There will also be an economic cost for Sweden's domestic arms industry if the country is obliged to buy Nato weapons instead of its own. The Kremlin spokesman Dmitri Peskov was emphatic in warning that Finland and Sweden joining Nato ""will not bring greater security for Europe"". Vladimir Putin likes to remind people of the time in his youth when he cornered a rat in a room and it turned on him in attack. Putin and his advisers already blame Nato, with some justification, for thwarting their plans to take over Ukraine. If they decide, unreasonably, that this sudden expansion on their northern flank presents an existential threat to Russia's security then there is no knowing exactly what Moscow could do in response.

They will also get free access to Cadw sites, in addition to the free rail travel scheme announced in March. The Welcome Ticket scheme, run by the Welsh government, will require users to show proof of refugee status. The scheme is voluntary for bus companies, but a ""majority"" of the services in Wales are expected to be included. Olga, a refugee who recently moved to Rhondda Cynon Taf with her nine-year-old daughter said the news was ""wonderful"". ""We really need something to focus our mind on just to get out of watching news,"" said Olga. ""There are fantastic places in Wales, we like the nature, we're just now returning from the seaside, it's really impressive, the people are so welcome. ""Me and my daughter were just looking for a safe sky, but we've got a good family, and we're so impressed with everything else."" The Welcome Ticket, will be open to all refugees and people arriving from Ukraine until 30 September. It will require passengers to show a valid passport, Biometric British Residence Permit or Home Office documentation to a bus driver when boarding. There will be no limit on the amount of journeys on local bus services, which include those operating into England where the journey starts or finishes in Wales. Olga and her daughter Leila moved in with Linda and her husband Mike only a few days ago, but Olga said they already feel like family members. Linda said the free bus travel would be ""invaluable"" to refugees, allowing them to integrate, make friends and travel for work. ""I'm finding in general all of the Ukrainians coming over are fiercely proud people and they want to work,"" said Linda, who helps co-ordinate a group of 26 families that are also hosting refugees. ""To be able to have free travel to get to work I think would be invaluable for them, they've not come over with much as they couldn't bring much with them. ""To have free bus travel, that will give them more disposable income to buy what they need, it's excellent, wonderful."" The Welsh government said refugees will have free access to all Cadw sites in Wales, such as Beaumaris Castle, Blaenavon Ironworks and Strata Florida Abbey, until 25 October this year. Deputy Minister for Arts and Sport, Dawn Bowden, said: ""I'm delighted to see Cadw playing its part in showing what being a Nation of Sanctuary means. ""This offer will be in place until 25 October, ensuring all those who come to Wales seeking sanctuary will have the opportunity to view and visit Welsh cultural and heritage sites across the country free of charge."" Welsh government minister Lee Waters added that the transport schemes should help refugees ""integrate into Wales and make a positive contribution to our nation"". "

347,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-61361827,2022-05-08T04:47:05,"Ukraine war: 'If this is true, then I am also a Nazi'"," The last time war came to Uman, the city was occupied by the Nazis. Now 83, Olga was only two years old when the soldiers arrived in her village. We are sitting around a table in a Jewish community centre in Uman, a city slightly west of the centre of Ukraine. The walls of the centre are covered in smiling photos of family gatherings and a box of matzah stapled to a display of a shabbat meal. Olga watches the tea in her cup gradually turn a bitter dark brown. She doesn't touch the biscuits on the table. She lives just a few miles from where she was brought up. ""We were taken 5km [three miles] to a field. I was with my mum and my grannie,"" she tells us. ""When we came to the field ditches were already dug. They began to shoot. We were surrounded by the dogs, by policemen, to stop anyone from running away. ""People started to fall into the ditch. Alive, dead, wounded. They started in the morning and it went on until midday. Then they sprinkled a little earth and left. ""Two boys, aged six and seven, survived. They started to look for other survivors. They dug me out with their hands."" Olga survived, kept hidden by a family until the war ended. She's one of three Holocaust survivors at the table. The other stories are similarly shocking. Dmytro's family lived in a forest to escape the Nazis. Yevhen remembers narrowly escaping from a basement when Nazi soldiers attempted to gas him with exhaust fumes. Only his mother and he survived the war. Russian President Vladimir Putin's repeated accusations that Ukraine needs to be de-Nazified feel particularly insulting to a group that lived through the occupation. ""I have many relatives in Russia. They start telling me that we have a lot of Nazis,"" says Dmytro. ""I tell them, if this is true, then I am also a Nazi. You can kill me too."" ""Putin has no business here,"" says Olga. ""The way he mocks peaceful people is simply unimaginable."" Now in their 80s, they find their home city facing a new threat. The city of Uman is well known as a place of pilgrimage for Orthodox Jews visiting the grave of Rabbi Nachman, the founder of Breslov Hasidic movement. Every year, during the holiday of Rosh Hashanah, thousands of worshipers arrive in the city. For now, the streets close to the grave are quiet. Posters in Hebrew, advertising PCR tests, blow gently in the breeze. We are told that of around 2,000 Breslov Jews that live in the city year round, only between 50 and 100 have stayed. Uman was hit by a missile in the first days of the war, killing a cyclist. It was enough for many to decide to leave. Uman is less than 160km from the Moldovan border. With roads leading from Dnipro in the east, Odesa in the south and Kyiv in the north, many evacuees passed through the city as they fled their country. Some of the Jewish community that stayed behind began to help. ""We decide to give them a place to sleep, the hotel and the medical centre,"" says Rabbi Nathan Ben Nun, president of the Rabbi Nachman foundation. ""War is not good, but we must make lemonade from lemons you know?"" One of the largest synagogues in Europe, the Breslov Hasidic synagogue can hold thousands of worshippers across its three floors. Usually only full during Rosh Hashanah, now this cavernous space is used as a welcome centre, open to all regardless of religion as a first port of call when they arrive in the city. The space is used for clothing donations - piles of jumpers, woolly hats and T-shirts are spread out over its pews - and volunteers cook meals for anyone who needs it. The synagogue's basement, usually used for ceremonial washing - Mikveh - is now a bunker. Mattresses are piled up on the wooden changing benches. ""We've had up to 200 people staying here,"" says Irina Rybnitskaya, lawyer at the Rabbi Nachman foundation who has helped organise the response at the synagogue. ""Some sleeping all night. On the first day of the war everyone was afraid. No one knew what to do. A lot of people came to us, so we were hosting them with tea and coffee."" ""The Hasidic community and Ukrainians became much closer. They don't differentiate between Jewish people or not Jewish. It doesn't matter."" Many evacuees left in a hurry with few possessions, money or idea of where they would go. In some of the city's concrete block hotels, usually packed only once a year by pilgrims, families have been found rooms, paid for by Jewish foundations. In one hotel, housing over 100 families, all now reliant on the kindness of strangers, we meet the seven members of the Yeremets family. They escaped from the Russian-occupied city of Kherson around two weeks ago. Piled up in the corner of their hotel room are three tool boxes. ""I work in IT, but I can make furniture too,"" said one family member, Dmytro. ""I thought perhaps wherever we end up, it might be useful."" They were planning to sleep in their car when they stumbled across the foundation. ""I'm almost 70,"" says grandfather Victor. ""But I've never seen anything like this in my life. They just said - here's everything you need. We did not expect this."" ""As long as I live, I will be so grateful to these people,"" says his daughter Ina. In the hotel dining room, we find Rabbi Liron Ederi. As well as organising the hotel accommodation, he has also left his city of Kryvyi Rih, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's home town. Rabbi Ederi says he's been thinking about his own mother, an Auschwitz survivor, and what she would have thought of the invasion, the violence, the fear, all carried out by Russia in the name of ridding Ukraine of Nazis. ""I believe that a person who accuses someone of something should first look in the mirror,"" he says. "
348,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-61348287,2022-05-07T23:50:16,Viewpoint: Putin now faces only different kinds of defeat," Whatever else Russia's Victory Day parade is supposed to represent, it won't be any sort of victory over Ukraine, regardless of the spin President Vladimir Putin and the Kremlin will try to put on it, writes defence analyst Michael Clarke. This war is one that Russia cannot win in any meaningful sense. Putin's foreign military successes around the world after 2008 were all achieved by using small units of elite forces, mercenaries and local militia groups alongside Russian air power. This gave Moscow considerable leverage at low cost during interventions in Georgia, Nagorno-Karabakh, Syria, Libya, Mali and twice in Ukraine during 2014, first in illegally annexing Crimea and then in creating self-declared Russian statelets in Luhansk and Donetsk. In every case, Russia moved swiftly and ruthlessly in ways the western world was unable to counter except through graduated sanctions regimes - nothing that could reverse the reality. Putin was adept at creating ""new facts on the ground"". In February he tried the same again on the grandest possible scale in Ukraine - to grab governmental power within about 72 hours in a country of 45 million people occupying the second biggest land area in Europe. It was an astonishing and reckless gamble and it failed completely in the first crucial week. Putin now has few options but to keep going forward to make this war bigger - either bigger in Ukraine or bigger by advancing beyond its borders. Escalation is built into the current situation and Europe has reached a very dangerous moment in its recent history. Having failed with Plan A to seize the government in Kyiv before President Zelensky's forces, or the outside world, could react, Moscow then switched to a Plan B. This was a more ""manoeuvrist"" military approach to surround Kyiv and move in on other Ukrainian cities - Chernihiv, Sumy, Kharkiv, Donetsk, Mariupol and Mykolaiv and simply snuff out Ukrainian armed resistance while Kyiv itself would be threatened with capitulation or destruction. This, too, failed. Kherson was the only major city that fell under Russian control and has since continued to resist Russian administration. The fact is that Russian forces were too small to dominate such a big country; they performed very poorly for a mixture of reasons; they were badly led and dispersed around four separate fronts, from Kyiv to Mykolaiv, with no overall commander. And they turned out to be up against a determined and well-trained Ukrainian army who fought them to a standstill in a classic demonstration of ""dynamic defence"" - not holding a line but rather hitting the attackers at points of maximum vulnerability. In frustration, Russia has now moved to ""plan C"", which is to give up on Kyiv and the north, instead concentrating all its forces for a major offensive in the Donbas region and across the south of Ukraine, probably as far as the port of Odesa in the south-west - effectively to landlock the country. This is the campaign we now see being played out in the east around Izyum and Popasne, Kurulka and Brazhkivka. Russian forces are trying to surround Ukraine's Joint Forces Operation, (JFO) - about 40% of its army that has been dug in opposite the breakaway Luhansk and Donetsk ""republics"" since 2014. Key Russian objectives are to take Slovyansk and, a little further south, Kramatorsk. They are both crucial strategic points for control of the whole Donbas region. And the war has moved into a different military phase - a struggle in more open country, during better weather, with tanks, mechanised infantry and, above all, artillery - designed to devastate an opponent's defence lines before armoured forces sweep in. But the process is not so simple. Russia's offensive got off to a staggered start and Ukraine's JFO has held the Russian offensive well short of the lines Russian commanders would have expected to reach by now. The Ukrainians have bought themselves some valuable time. A ""race of the heavy metal"" is under way as each side tries to bring in its heavy fighting equipment before the battle is fully joined. We can expect to see this develop over the next couple of weeks. What happens in the Donbas, however, offers Putin only a choice between different types of defeat. If the battle reaches an autumn stalemate, he will have precious little to show for so much loss and pain. If the military momentum shifts and his forces get pushed back, even more so. And even if the Russians succeed in overrunning the whole of the Donbas and all across the south, they still have to hold those territories for the indefinite future in the face of several million Ukrainians who don't want them there. Any significant Russian military success will likely create a major, open-ended insurgency that will get bigger for every district Russian forces may overrun. Putin went for broke in February with Plan A. The failure of that scheme means that plans B, C or any subsequent plans still leaves Russia going for broke - needing to suppress some or all of a very big country. One way or another, Russia will have to keep fighting in Ukraine, either against the population, or against the Ukrainian army, and quite possibly both simultaneously. And as long as Kyiv sticks to its current line that demands Russian withdrawal before any concessions can be contemplated, there is not much Putin can do but carry grimly on. The western powers will keep supplying weapons and money to Kyiv, and will not be lifting powerful sanctions on Russia any time soon. Once Europe's energy dependency on it is greatly lessened, Russia has so little that Europe really needs, the US and Europe will be able to leave crippling sanctions in place with small cost to their own economies. There is no way back for Vladimir Putin personally and he may even be indicted as a war criminal. His only political strategy is to make the war in Ukraine into something else - part of a struggle for Russia's very survival against the ""Nazis"" and ""imperialists"" of the West who relish the chance to take Russia down. That's why it suits him to toy with the dangerous idea that Russia is facing a ""Great Patriotic War 2.0"" with the rest of Europe. We will probably hear a lot more about this on Victory Day. President Putin will claim to see light at the end of a very dark and long tunnel into which he has steered his own country.

PTSD - Post Traumatic Stress Disorder - affects millions worldwide. The BBC's Fergal Keane, who was diagnosed in 2008, explores its effects and the potential for healing. All day and much of the night I went back and forth in my mind. Do I stay, or go? It was around mid-February and I was certain that war was coming to Ukraine. From my hotel room in Kyiv I looked out on a skyline that might soon be lit by the fire of explosions. The part of me that wanted to tell one of the biggest stories of my lifetime longed to stay. But it is also the part that is drawn to danger and has brought anguish into my personal life in the form of PTSD. What I knew for certain, was that staying on under what I suspected then might be a constant bombardment, along with street fighting, would place my mental health in grave danger. Did I really want to end up in hospital again, my nerves jumping at any loud noise, unable to sleep, exhausted by the depression that invariably comes with my PTSD, and the sense of guilt at the stress felt by my loved ones watching me report from an active frontline? I had also publicly committed to give up war reporting several years before. I booked a flight and went home the following morning. Yet soon afterwards, I was in Lviv in the far west of Ukraine reporting on the massive flow of refugees heading to western Europe. A few friends messaged asking why I was there after promising publicly to avoid war reporting. My rationale was that I was not under fire in Lviv. It was too far west for the Russians to come. It was a way of covering the story without being in danger. Which is true. But being in Lviv was also part of my internal struggle. I could not entirely leave the war zones behind. It was during the making of my BBC documentary on PTSD that I began to seriously consider the addictive nature of war reporting in my own case. Yes, I was a journalist with a deep curiosity about the world and particularly how human beings behave in extreme situations. History and how it plays out in modern conflicts is also a passion of mine, and I have always felt that the work of witness is central to upholding human rights. In 30 years, I've reported on numerous wars and civil conflicts - from Belfast during the Troubles to genocide in Rwanda, to Iraq, Afghanistan and Ukraine. But there was a less healthy aspect to my choice of work. War repeated the nervous stress, and the powerful compulsion to prove I could survive, that I had experienced as a child growing up in a home fractured by the effects of my dad's alcoholism. In war zones I could prove I was no longer a scared child. I had a voice. Since being given my official diagnosis back in 2008, I have used a combination of therapy - the ""talking cure"" - and anti-depressant medication. My therapy was CBT - Cognitive Behavioural Therapy - which examines negative thoughts associated with trauma and tries to replace them with positive ones. The mix of talking and medication have helped to ease the symptoms and show me a healthier way to live. It has also been more than 20 years since I had a drink - for years before I tried to medicate the pain inside with alcohol. PTSD Symptoms If you have been affected by any of the issues in this story you can visit BBC Action Line Fergal Keane - Living with PTSD is broadcast on BBC2 on Monday 9 May at 21:00 BST, as part of Mental Health Awareness Week. It is estimated that three in 100 adults in the UK have experienced PTSD. Victims of rape, assault, domestic violence, and survivors of accidents are among those who can develop symptoms. I cannot stress enough that each individual mind, and traumatic experience, calls for an individual approach. The best mental health professionals realise they are dealing with individuals and not cases to be slotted under pre-determined labels. Researching for the BBC film Living With PTSD, I had a chance to examine the different treatments now being used to treat the disorder: from therapy through the use of medications, including experiments with the drug MDMA. It stimulates the release of neurotransmitters in the brain which can create a mood of empathy, making therapy more beneficial. MDMA treatment is being clinically trialled in Britain but is not yet approved for general use. Another method being explored is the use of video games, like the puzzle Tetris, which can ease stress in the brain. Trials in the US and Britain have showed beneficial effects. I have been lucky to have the support of my employers and the love of family and friends. These are essential weapons in the battle against the loneliness and lack of self-worth that are so much part of my experience of PTSD. I have also been helped enormously by listening to the experiences of others who have struggled with PTSD. In the course of making the film, I visited the WAVE Trauma Centre in Belfast, which provides therapy and emotional support to survivors of Troubles-era violence. One study - carried out over a decade ago - found Northern Ireland had the highest rates of PTSD in the world. More than 50% of those surveyed had suffered mental health problems related to the Troubles. At WAVE, I sat with a group that included a woman blown up in an IRA bomb attack which killed her fellow passenger; a man who was shot by terrorists at work, and the remarkable Peter Heathwood, who was paralysed from the waist down in a gun attack by Loyalists in 1979. His father arrived on the scene as paramedics were taking Peter to the ambulance. Because they had no blankets, the crew had placed Peter in a body bag to keep him warm. When his father saw this he assumed Peter was dead and had a fatal heart attack on the spot. His wife, Anne, who had answered the door when the gunmen knocked, never recovered from the trauma of that day. ""There were no sort of therapies back then,"" Peter recalls. ""I'll never forget it, the eyes were like stone, as if she was a statue. You could talk to her but there was no answer."" Anne began to drink heavily and died at the age of 51. Peter regrets that his wife didn't have access to the talking therapy he has been able to experience at WAVE. ""Unfortunately, I never knew about it at the time, but I really couldn't emphasise the importance of us talking, and getting people who have the same problems, who are out there today, to know what we can offer them and get them in here to be talked to."" The group asked if I would say a few words. I told them what I was feeling at that moment. That it was humbling to sit with them, to be among people who had suffered so much, and yet found the courage to talk, and to help each other. I told them they inspired me, and if there is to be healing for people like me it starts by reaching out to people who understand. I said that being with them was like coming home. I felt hope.

Sergeii Marchenko said although he did not think it would necessarily end the war, it would make it harder for Russia ""to finance their military needs"". He said the invasion of Ukraine had pushed up energy prices, tipping the scales in Moscow's favour. It comes as the European Union tries to reach agreement on a full ban on imports of Russian oil. The bloc has already pledged to reduce gas imports by two-thirds by the end of 2022. Mr Marchenko said: ""Huge oil and gas prices help Russia to receive additional amounts to make their budget run with a surplus. In comparison we are running [the country] with very huge deficit [in] our budget."" ""I believe that [a] full embargo can make Russia suffer more than it is right now,"" he added. About 40% of EU gas imports and 27% of oil imports come from Russia. The bloc's politicians are trying to balance their desire to support Ukraine with the needs of their energy hungry citizens and businesses. On Friday European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen admitted it was ""not easy to establish unity"" amongst the 27 members but added that she was ""confident"" an oil embargo could be agreed. Even before the war, last year's increase in prices meant oil and gas revenues accounted for 36%, or $119bn, of the spending of Russian President Vladimir Putin's government. However this could increase significantly, to more than $180bn, despite big production cuts by Russia - the world's third biggest oil producer - according to the consultancy Rystad Energy. In comparison Ukraine's economy is forecast to shrink 45% this year because of the conflict, according to the World Bank. Mr Marchenko said the war meant his country was collecting less in taxes ""because more than 20% of our businesses are fully closed"". ""It means that we can't manage to fulfil our necessary duty as [a] government without international support, or without just printing money,"" he added. Another reason Ukraine's economy is struggling to support itself is because of the sharp fall in commodity exports. Before the war it was one of the world's top producers of crops such as sunflower, corn and wheat but it is now a lot more difficult to earn money by selling those to the rest of the world. Russia now controls the majority of Ukraine's port cities and with the country's harbours blocked off an increasing amount of what it can still export is leaving by trains, which have a smaller capacity. ""The key question for us is how to unblock the seaports of Ukraine,"" Mr Marchenko said. Doing so could help reduce soaring global food prices by increasing supplies. The fall in Ukraine's agricultural exports is ""a big source of concern for a number of countries"", according to Odile Renaud-Basso, who is President of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD). The economic development body is trying to support Ukraine's farmers as well as other countries that rely on their produce, she said. ""The more we keep economic infrastructure, equipment businesses afloat, the less the cost will be later on. So I think this is why we need to act now and not only wait for the reconstruction,"" she added. The bank was already investing around $1bn a year before the war to help develop Ukraine's economy. With shareholder backing ""we would be ready to increase it"" to help with rebuilding things such as destroyed roads, bridges and buildings, Ms Renaud-Basso said. Ukraine's government estimates $600bn of damage has been done so far. The EBRD president said external support, grants and loans would be needed to rebuild the country, similar to what happened in Europe after World War Two. Work on how to do that has already started, she added. Ukraine is calling for Russia to foot the bill and Ms Renaud-Basso said ""this debate will have to take place"". But she cautioned lessons from the end of World War One need to be heeded. ""It had a very strong impact on Germany, and was one of the origins of what came with Hitler. I think that, for Europeans, this is part of the memory and we need to keep that in mind,"" she said.

352,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-61354626,2022-05-07T23:06:19,'We tried not to watch' - escapees recount terror of Russian-occupied Izyum," ""We thought those were our last minutes. It was extremely scary but we were lucky."" Elena is recalling the moment Russian troops started shelling, after she and a group of escapees passed through one of their checkpoints. After two months living in the basement of a kindergarten in the Russian-occupied town of Izyum in Ukraine, Elena spent two nerve-shredding days on the road to safety. She and her daughter were among 20 people in a convoy of vehicles heading away from Russian-controlled territory. They fled last Friday using a route organised by volunteers. ""All that time we were praying,"" said Elena, 52, recounting how they passed through numerous Russian checkpoints. When troops asked them where they were going, the group convinced the soldiers they were headed for Russia. At one checkpoint, Elena said, Russians looked through her daughter's phone, and became angry when they saw messages to her friends about the situation in Izyum. Finally the pair reached safety in Poltava, a city in central Ukraine. But she said she felt as though she'd lost everything and couldn't forget the horror of what she went through in her home city after the start of the war. ""Bodies were lying for weeks in the streets. We tried not to watch them in order to save our minds. We couldn't bury dead people because it equalled being killed as well. The shelling was non-stop,"" she said. Elena and others in the basement had cooked food on a fire and lived off vegetables collected from their gardens. ""Everyone brought everything they had. We all shared food,"" she said. ""It helped us not to lose hope."" She adds that Russian troops were looting everything, including people's underwear. Soldiers drove around the city in stolen cars with ""Z"" signs painted on them, she recalled. ""They were armed and often very drunk. It was very scary when an armoured personnel carrier was driving on your street and soldiers with machine guns were sitting in it. We tried to hide."" Situated south-east of Kharkiv, the city of Izyum is known as the gateway to the Donbas - Ukraine's old coal and steel-producing region, more than a third of which was seized by Moscow-backed separatists in 2014. It is surrounded by forests and rivers, which make it a natural fortress. And within the city boundaries is the Kremenets mountain, which is 218m (715ft) above sea level. ""Whoever has control of this mountain has a significant military advantage,"" said Maxym Strelnik, an official of Izyum city council. All this made the city an important prize and soon after the Kremlin's invasion, it came under heavy bombardment. On 1 April, Russia seized control and has occupied the city since. Now, Mr Strelnik, who was told by the Ukrainian military to leave the area, estimates that 80% of the city has been destroyed. Between 10,000 and 15,000 civilians remain in Izyum, he believes. ""There is no water, electricity, gas, heating and the sewage system doesn't work,"" he said. In March, during the initial stages of the invasion, people were forced to stay in their freezing basements without heating. Those who fell ill were unable to get medical treatment. ""We cannot even estimate how many victims there are in the city. There are no medical facilities or funeral services. The dead are buried near houses and in the city parks. It's a horrible reality,"" he said. Among those still trapped in Izyum is the mother of Katerina, who escaped with her husband and two children at the beginning of March. ""She calls me from time to time - sometimes once a week,"" Katerina said. ""Even now when I'm safe, I can't feel 100% fine because my mum is left in a town that doesn't exist."" By the time Katerina got out, it was too late for her mother, who lived in a part of Izyum then already occupied by the Russians. She was forbidden to leave her house by soldiers. Katerina's own escape was a harrowing experience. The family had been sheltering together in their basement for seven days when a Russian bomb fell just 500 metres from their house. ""The ground started to fall from the ceiling,"" she told the BBC. ""I started to understand then that our basement would not withstand the bombs."" She and her family had just 15 minutes to prepare to leave. They took very little - only children's clothes. Even the family pets had to be left behind. As they left, she said, she could hear shells above her head. ""The feeling of hearing them will be impossible to get rid of."" Mr Strelnik has stayed close to Izyum, albeit in a zone still under Ukrainian control, to ensure he can try to help the people still inside. But communication with them is incredibly hard. For the past seven days, there has been no mobile phone connection between the town and the outside world. The families of those still inside are desperate to hear from them, he says. The lack of mobile coverage has also made life difficult for Volodymyr Zelensky - not Ukraine's president, but an ordinary citizen of the same name who has been volunteering to help those inside the city get out. During brief spells when a signal was available, relatives informed those still inside about evacuation buses which collected residents from small villages on the outskirts of the city. ""We evacuated about 200 people,"" said Mr Zelenskyy. ""People were very emotional when they got to the evacuation points. They didn't have a hope for weeks and finally when they saw us, they thought that we were their saviours."" But he said the rescue effort was dangerous work. ""The last time our volunteers extracted people from [the nearby village of] Spyvakiva, they were shot by Russian snipers. Three people were killed and three people were wounded,"" he said. The BBC has been unable to independently verify this claim. Both Katerina and Elena count themselves lucky they were able to escape Izyum when they did. But their memories of home in peacetime are haunting. Katerina remembers the place which she says had everything she needed, including parks for children. ""It was so cute, so cosy, like a small fluffy pillow, that feels like your mother hugging you,"" she said. Elena misses the days when she would plant flowers in the garden with her granddaughter. ""We did not realise how lucky we were,"" she said. ""Now I realise I was living in a paradise."" "

The operation began a week ago, co-ordinated by the UN and Red Cross, which have not confirmed the news. Ukrainian forces are holding out at the heavily bombed plant, the last part of the city not under Russian control. Russia has besieged the plant for weeks, demanding the surrender of its defenders from the Azov battalion. The whereabouts of the evacuees are not yet clear, but Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said this part of the humanitarian operation was now complete. In the past, it has taken days for those evacuated to reach Ukrainian-held territory. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said more than 300 civilians had been rescued from the plant, although the Russian defence ministry gave a much lower number, saying 51 people had been evacuated over a period of three days. Mr Zelensky said diplomatic efforts were continuing to get military personnel out of Mariupol. Capturing Mariupol is important to Russian troops because it will allow them to complete a land bridge between Crimea and the Donbas region, as well as giving them full control of more than 80% of Ukraine's Black Sea coastline. But in their quest to do so, they have pummelled Mariupol with artillery, rockets and missiles - damaging or destroying more than 90% of the city. Analysis by Laura Bicker, BBC News, Zaporizhzhia Ukrainian fighters inside the Azovstal complex issued a statement on social media saying both they and the Russians had been using a white flag system to halt fighting to get civilian people out. It sounds like progress between the two sides, and lives have been saved by these negotiations. But Kremlin-backed forces have reportedly intensified their fire on the steel works in recent days, despite pledges of a ceasefire. The previous UN and Red Cross operation to free more than 100 people was held up by land mines and mortar fire. Now that the civilians are free, it puts new pressure on the Ukrainian government to find a way out for about 2,000 fighters using the site to make a last stand for the city of Mariupol - and who have vowed never to surrender. Their families have issued a desperate plea to world leaders to negotiate their safe release. Meanwhile, Russia has said there will be no Victory Day celebrations in Mariupol. Victory Day is celebrated annually on 9 May in Russia to mark the Soviet Union's victory in World War Two. ""A time will come and there will be a big celebration there,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters, adding there were no plans for official visits on the day. At the same time, intense fighting has continued in the Kharkiv region as troops attempt to regain control of the area from the Russians. Ukraine's armed forces said on Saturday that they had taken five villages north-east of the country's second largest city. Analysts say the Ukrainian operation is developing into a successful counter-offensive. Kharkiv has been the focus of intense shelling since the 24 February invasion. "

The annual military parade in Moscow's Red Square has a new significance this year, as Russian forces continue their two-month assault in Ukraine. The 9 May, Victory Day, is one of the most important holidays in the Russian calendar. On Monday, there will be military processions all over the country to commemorate the Soviet defeat of Nazi Germany in 1945. As always, flags flutter from almost every building and shop windows are decorated with golden stars. But this year will be different. Russia is at war once again - this time with its neighbour. Vladimir Putin may have hoped to have used the anniversary to present the Russian people with a victory of his own in Ukraine. But following an invasion which hasn't gone to plan, he's yet to even accomplish his most recently stated aim to take the Donbas region. Read analysis from the BBC's Jenny Hill in Moscow here. How does a European country stay neutral when war rages in Europe? Switzerland managed it during the first and second world wars, but now, watching Russia's attack on Ukraine, many Swiss are rethinking their long-established position. Switzerland was granted ""eternal neutrality"" at the Congress of Vienna in 1815. It was a pragmatic, geopolitical move that was supported because the country was seen as a harmless buffer between Europe's big powers - France on one side, Austria and Prussia on the other - and it preserved Switzerland's safety while its neighbours slaughtered each other. During World War Two, Swiss neutrality was more pragmatic than heroic. Switzerland mobilised all its able-bodied men to defend its borders, but it also banked gold looted by the Nazis and, in a shameful move designed to keep Germany at bay, turned away thousands of Jewish refugees - a policy it finally apologised for in the 1990s. For decades, neutrality has enjoyed almost universal support among the Swiss: opinion polls have shown approval ratings of well over 90%. But now the Swiss are soul-searching.

Ukrainian authorities confirmed that several locations around Odesa's airport were hit. That includes the runway, which was hit twice, and a furniture production plant.

It comes after Ukraine's armed forces claimed on Saturday that they had taken five villages north-east of the country's second largest city. Analysts say the Ukrainian operation is developing into a successful counter-offensive. Kharkiv has been the focus of intense shelling since the February invasion. The governor of Kharkiv region said on Saturday that Russian troops continue ""to fire on civilians in Kharkiv region"". Oleh Synyehubov on Telegram reminded people to ""not go out unnecessarily"" and told people not to ignore the air raid sirens. There is concern that the Russian shelling could intensify in the run up to Victory Day on May 9, when Russia commemorates its win over Nazi Germany in 1945. The region has been heavily targeted by Russian forces since the invasion, but a report from the Institute of the Study of War says that Ukrainian troops are now ""notably retaking territory along a broad arc around Kharkiv"". It added that Ukrainian troops may be able to relieve Russian pressure on Kharkiv ""and potentially threaten to make further advances to the Russian border."" Hubanov Pavlo, a children's doctor in Kharkiv told the BBC that people are still hiding in shelters and are not going to work. ""There is no normal life in the city,"" he said. ""Kharkiv is very close to the Russian border and so the city is constantly under attack. Unfortunately while the war continues, we cannot relax and we are constantly on alert."" Mr Pavlo used to work at Kharkiv Regional Pediatric Hospital but it was destroyed by shelling. ""The shells hit our hospital several times, and now the building is destroyed and it was impossible to provide medical care there, because Russians were shooting all the time. I am now working in another hospital,"" he said.

357,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-61320132,2022-05-06T23:39:33,Ukraine war sees Swiss challenge their age-old neutrality," How does a European country stay neutral when war rages in Europe? Switzerland managed it during the first and second world wars, but now, watching Russia's attack on Ukraine, many Swiss are rethinking their long-established position. Switzerland was granted ""eternal neutrality"" at the Congress of Vienna in 1815.

Switzerland mobilised all its able-bodied men to defend its borders, but it also banked gold looted by the Nazis and, in a shameful move designed to keep Germany at bay, turned away thousands of Jewish refugees - a policy it finally apologised for in the 1990s. Nevertheless, gratitude for being spared two world wars is, says Markus Haefliger, politics correspondent with the Tagesanzeiger newspaper, ""almost in our genes… that makes neutrality so important for Swiss people"". For decades, neutrality has enjoyed almost universal support among the Swiss - opinion polls have shown approval ratings of well over 90%. But now, says Mr Haefliger, the Swiss are soul-searching. ""They ask themselves how can you stay neutral in a war like Ukraine? It's so clear who is the good guy and who is the bad guy."" When Russia invaded its neighbour in February, thousands of Swiss citizens took to the streets, condemning the aggression and demanding support for Ukraine. Thousands also offered their homes to Ukrainian refugees, for whom the Swiss government has offered visa-free collective protection. For young Swiss in particular, the idea that their country could stay aloof in such a conflict seemed unthinkable. Operation Libero is a young, non-aligned political movement which campaigns for closer ties with Europe - Switzerland is not a member of the EU - and a less isolationist strategy. Its president, Sanija Ameti, believes this new war has been a wake-up call. ""Swiss people are realising that they are part of this European family of liberal democracies. This is a fight between systems, the one that we are in, and the autocratic, kleptocratic system of [Russian President] Putin."" That's a view shared by most political parties and most members of the Swiss government, which moved after a brief hesitation to adopt all the EU's sanctions against Russia. It's a big change from just 40 years ago, when - to the enduring shame of many Swiss - Switzerland did not join sanctions against apartheid South Africa. The adoption of sanctions was greeted with headlines around the world, suggesting that Switzerland had abandoned neutrality. In fact, when it comes to sanctions, neutrality has been fraying round the edges for some time, says Stefanie Walter, politics professor at Zurich University. ""Switzerland has actually changed position quite a lot in the last couple of decades,"" she points out. It joined United Nations sanctions against Iraq in the 1990s, and those against former Yugoslavia. ""And right now, as well as Ukraine, there are about 23 other sanctions in place."" But while sanctions may be supported by most Swiss, any military support appears at first out of the question. Switzerland's neutrality is legally defined by the Hague Convention of 1907, and forbids sending weapons to countries at war, as does Swiss domestic law on weapons exports, which was recently tightened. And so when Germany asked Switzerland to permit the export of Swiss-made ammunition for tanks Berlin is sending to Kyiv, the Swiss said no. That move prompted criticism from a surprising source, when the leader of the centrist Die Mitte party tweeted that in his opinion it would be legitimate to send weapons in the defence of European democracy. Other centrist politicians have suggested closer Swiss ties with the Nato military alliance, including a common air defence system and participation in the organisation's military exercises. Such opinions would have been unimaginable just a few months ago, and they will be fiercely resisted by the right, where the Swiss People's Party is threatening a referendum to make even sanctions illegal, and on the left, where the Social Democrats and the Greens are opposed to any military involvement. But bit by bit, many Swiss are beginning to contemplate a new identity, and a new security strategy for their country. A recent opinion poll showed that, while two-thirds of Swiss still opposed the idea of joining Nato, more than half (52%) were in favour of joining a European defence union. This plan, known in Brussels as Pesco (permanent structured military co-operation) would involve countries committing to a common security and defence policy. Armies would work together, and fighter planes, tanks and other weapons would be jointly procured. The end goal: a common European army. The idea of neutral, non-EU member Switzerland getting involved in something like this would have been unthinkable just a few months ago, but the war in Ukraine has clearly changed opinions. Sanija Ameti believes Switzerland has a responsibility to defend European liberal democracy. ""We really need a debate about whether we have to protect our system with weapons,"" she explains. ""The consequence would mean not being neutral anymore."" Prof Walter does not go quite that far but suggests that ""Switzerland has to define neutrality anew"". For Markus Haefliger, the war in Ukraine has clarified Switzerland's position in a new, polarised world. ""Switzerland is so clearly part of the Western world, its values, its economy, its traditions, everything,"" he says. ""The big question is, can we be neutral in the traditional sense in this new world order?"" "
358,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-61338097,2022-05-06T23:38:14,Victory Day parade: Moscow readies itself and turns up rhetoric," The annual military parade in Moscow's Red Square has a new significance this year, as Russian forces continue their two-month assault in Ukraine. As tanks roll through the city streets, speculation is intensifying over President Vladimir Putin's next move. Fighter jets and bombers roared over Moscow earlier this week. It was just a rehearsal - for a grand military parade and flypast to mark Victory Day. The ninth of May is one of the most important holidays in the Russian calendar and on Monday there'll be military processions all over the country to commemorate the Soviet Victory over Nazi Germany in 1945. As always, flags flutter from almost every building and shop windows are decorated with golden stars. But this year will be different. Russia is at war once again - this time with its neighbour. And Vladimir Putin may have hoped to have used the anniversary to present the Russian people with a victory of his own in Ukraine. But, following an invasion which hasn't gone to plan, he's yet to even accomplish his most recently stated aim to take the Donbas region. ""Everyone is expecting something to happen [on 9 May], both the enemies of Putin and his supporters,"" says political expert Abbas Gallyamov, who was once a speechwriter for Mr Putin. ""These expectations created a vacuum that needs to be filled. If it's not, Putin will lose politically."" The question of what Mr Putin might do has set analysts guessing and rumours swirling. The Kremlin has dismissed as nonsense reports that he might use the opportunity to officially declare war on Ukraine - or even the West - and seek to mobilise reservists or even civilians to replenish his depleted army. But many experts assume that, at the very least, he'll dress up any territorial gains in eastern Ukraine as a victory worthy of celebration. Though that's unlikely to mean the end of the war. Mr Gallyamov makes a fascinating prediction, that Mr Putin will then present Ukraine with an ultimatum - come to the negotiating table or choose to fight on and face the threat of a tactical nuclear weapon. ""The only way he can win now, because he'll definitely lose if it continues, is to produce the impression of an absolutely crazy guy. He wants the western public to get scared, western leaders to get scared and for them to start calling Zelensky and say: 'Enough now let's stop this. Go to the negotiating table and agree to at least some of the demands he makes. Because we're ready to help you but we're not ready to die because of you."" Mr Putin, he believes, deeply regrets his invasion and needs a way out without looking weak. But what do his people think? Opinion polls suggest he has majority support but it's unwise to fully trust even the independent polling agencies in a country which has criminalised the expression of anything other than the official narrative - that Vladimir Putin's ""special military operation"" is an honourable and necessary act of self-defence. There is opposition but, again, it's difficult to quantify. The street demonstrations which accompanied the first weeks of war have dwindled to the occasional individual protest. The independent monitoring group OVD info have recorded more than 15,000 detentions of protesters - most of them in the early days of the invasion. A recent series of fires at sites with military or tactical significance have prompted speculation about domestic sabotage but there is no conclusive evidence to back the theory, and fires are common here, largely due to old or dilapidated buildings and infrastructure. But a recent wander through Moscow city centre gave at the least a sense of popular sentiment. On one pedestrian precinct some of the shops displayed the Z sign, which has become a symbol of support for the Russian offensive. A couple of stores were selling T-shirts featuring the letter. One shopkeeper modelled one rather ostentatiously in his doorway. Most people walked by, apparently unmoved. But some did stop to gather around a large and eye-catching display of black and white photographs in the centre of the precinct. Close-up images of the faces of distressed children stared out at them. I noticed one woman wipe tears from her eyes as she looked at the exhibition. These were, the sign proclaimed, the children of Donbas. It's one of Vladimir Putin's pretexts for the war. That his troops are coming to the rescue of the Russian speaking population of eastern Ukraine, who are imperilled by a murderous regime in Kyiv. And he's gone to extraordinary lengths to create a parallel reality in which Russia is both defender and victim. And Ukraine and the West are the aggressors. State TV has long presented the West as Russia's nemesis but, in the run up to Victory Day, the rhetoric and the aggression has intensified. Presenters rail furiously against America and Europe and their supply of weapons to Ukraine. Echoing the Kremlin, they blame the west for provoking ""World War Three"" and seeking to prolong the conflict for as long as possible. It's a powerful tool. One of the most popular TV programmes in the last few weeks was a talk show in which a presenter warned Britain that, if provoked, Russian could completely destroy it with nuclear weapons. And over the last month, free exhibitions about Nato have opened in more than 20 Russian cities. At the display in Moscow last week a group of students stared, impressed, at an anti-tank missile as a guide explained that this was a British weapon, the likes of which were being used, right now, against Russian soldiers. A menacing soundtrack droned like a warplane overhead and sinister murals of western soldiers covered the walls. An introductory sign stated that Nato was one of the world's most aggressive alliances and unhesitatingly used force in its own interests. The visitor book was illuminating; ""very stupid propaganda - no to war"" someone had written. But there were scrawled Zs too. Another hand had crossed out the words ""glory to Ukraine"" and written ""free from Nazis"". It's a telling phrase. Vladimir Putin has also sought, infamously and baselessly, to portray his war as a necessary ""de-Nazification"" of Ukraine. He's described the government in Kyiv as neo-Nazis. And his foreign minister recently triggered international outrage when, after acknowledging that the Ukrainian president is Jewish, he claimed that Hitler also had Jewish ancestry. It's why 9 May is such a powerful date for Mr Putin. It's an opportunity to exploit this country's long and painful memory of the sacrifice made by its people in the fight against Nazi Germany. To rally today's Russians behind his ""cause"". To use his country's past to legitimise his present. It was chilling to see state TV coverage of one of the rehearsals for the military parade in Moscow. An elderly lady was featured, watching the trucks and missile launchers thunder past. She'd been at the very first parade, having lived through the war as a child, she told her interviewer. And then she turned away and stiffly raised her arm to wave at Vladimir Putin's tanks as they paraded by, a fond smile spreading across her face. Additional reporting by Yaroslava Kiryukhina "

Speaking to a London think tank, Volodymyr Zelensky said that was the minimum that his country could accept. He said he was the leader of ""Ukraine, not a mini-Ukraine"". But he did not mention Crimea, annexed by Russia in 2014. Russia is currently battling to take full control of the city of Mariupol. There are still Ukrainian forces along with some civilians in the south-eastern city's vast Azovstal steelworks, which has been subjected to a furious Russian onslaught. Finally taking Mariupol would be Russia's biggest achievement in two months of war and would give Russia's President Vladimir Putin something to celebrate on 9 May, which is Victory Day in Russia - the day the country marks the Soviet victory over the Nazis in World War Two. However speaking from Kyiv to the Chatham House think tank in London, Mr Zelensky said there could be no question of Russia holding on to territory it has conquered since it invaded Ukraine. ""To stop the war between Russia and Ukraine the step should be regaining the situation as of 23 February,"" he said in response to a question from the BBC, referring to the day before the war began. ""I was elected by the people of Ukraine as president of Ukraine, not as president of a mini Ukraine of some kind. This is a very important point,"" he added. The reference to the situation as of 23 February suggests Ukraine may not insist on retaking Crimea before making peace with Russia. The peninsula was annexed by Russia eight years ago. Mr Zelensky called for the resumption of diplomatic dialogue between Russia and Ukraine: ""Despite the fact that they destroyed all our bridges, I think not all the bridges are yet destroyed, figuratively speaking,"" he said. Russia, for its part, has described that process as being in a ""state of stagnation"". On Friday a further 50 civilians including 11 children were evacuated from the Azovstal steelworks in Mariupol, Russia and Ukraine said, in an operation coordinated by the UN and Red Cross. More are believed to still be trapped in the Soviet-era tunnels and bunkers beneath the sprawling factory. Ukraine's Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said the operation had been slowed by fighting and what she called ""provocations"". She said evacuations would resume on Saturday. Russia had earlier announced a daytime ceasefire at the plant for three days, starting Thursday. Meanwhile Mr Zelensky said he was inviting German Chancellor Olaf Scholz to visit Ukraine on 9 May. The German leader's presence in Ukraine on the day Russia commemorates the Soviet sacrifice in World War Two would be highly symbolic. ""He can make this very powerful, wise political step, to come here on 9 May, to Kyiv,"" Mr Zelensky said. ""I am not explaining the significance, I think you're cultured enough to understand why."" The Ukrainian leader has previously been critical of Germany's stance during the war. In a BBC interview in April he accused Germany of blocking efforts to embargo sales of Russian energy and said European countries that continued to buy Russian oil were ""earning their money in other people's blood"". The same month a planned visit to Kyiv by German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier was cancelled at the last minute because of Germany's economic ties to Russia. Also on Friday US President Joe Biden announced $150m (£120m) in new military aid to help Ukraine defend itself. A senior US official told reporters the aid included artillery rounds, counter-artillery radars used for detecting the source of enemy fire, electronic jamming equipment and spare parts. But Mr Biden warned that current funding was close to running out and urged Congress to authorise more. The US says it is also providing intelligence to Ukraine, and US media reports have quoted officials as saying US intelligence helped Ukraine sink Russia's flagship missile cruiser the Moskva. "

Could the woman long rumoured to be his girlfriend be next? The EU has added Alina Kabaeva to a list of proposed individuals to be targeted in the next round of measures in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Ms Kabaeva is a former gold medal winning gymnast. She then became a politician in the ruling United Russia party, and currently heads a holding company that has large stakes in almost all major state media outlets. It is for her role in putting out Kremlin propaganda - as well as what the EU call her close association to Mr Putin - that she could find herself on a black list. She may be more than a media boss, though. As far back as 2008, Mr Putin denied the pair were in a relationship. More recent reports say they have children together. Here's what we know about her For days, small numbers of civilians have slowly been leaving the Azovstal steelworks in Mariupol, the last pocket of Ukrainian resistance in a city that has seen some of the worst fighting of the conflict. Friday saw about 50 civilians evacuated, with Ukraine accusing Russia of violating a ceasefire by firing on the area. There are believed to be up to 200 civilians still sheltering in the tunnels beneath the plant. One of the Ukrainian fighters there told the BBC: ""The situation at the steelworks is now critical; it has been critical for a long time, and now it is getting worse."" Those leaving are just a handful of the estimated 12 million people displaced by the war. We've been looking at where they ended up. What would it take to end the war? On Friday, the BBC's Frank Gardner asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky what the ""minimum"" concession from Russia would be in return for a peace deal. ""A return of Russian forces to where they were on 23 February,"" he said. That is the day before the invasion began - and so does not include the return of Crimea - a part of Ukraine annexed by Russia in 2014. ""But for this to happen there needs to be diplomatic dialogue,"" Mr Zelensky added. ""From our side, not all the diplomatic bridges have been burnt."" Russia, for its part, has described that process as being in a ""state of stagnation"". The sinking of the Moskva battleship is largely held as one of Ukraine's most important symbolic victories of the war to date. Now, US media outlets are reporting that American officials passed intelligence to their Ukrainian counterparts to help identify and locate the ship. Anonymous US officials are quoted as saying they did not know that Ukraine would target the Moskva after helping determine its location. Read more about the accusations and denials here. Getting medical supplies to the Ukrainian border - and fast - following an attack can be challenging. That's why a huge number of German private pilots are volunteering to fly them in small turboprop planes - sometimes paying the hefty costs themselves. That's not the end of the story, though - as it makes no sense to fly an empty plane back when people need evacuation. "
361,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-61332283,2022-05-06T11:20:12,Why 9 May Victory Day is so important for Russia," It has become an annual event - the military parade in Red Square in Moscow and cities across Russia on 9 May, marking victory over Nazi Germany in 1945. Under Vladimir Putin, Victory Day has become a show of strength of troops and military hardware, as well as a chance to remember the sacrifices of World War Two. Twenty-seven million Soviet citizens died, by far the greatest loss of any country, in what Russians call the Great Patriotic War. This year, the event has taken on a significance of its own. Far from liberating Europe, Russia has waged months of war against its neighbour Ukraine and is devoid of any real form of military victory that it can celebrate. Regiments that played a key role in the war will parade in front of the top brass and the president, whose address will echo across Red Square and be scrutinised for what to expect next. Russia's leader often uses this moment to send messages of intent. The Victory Day parade was occasionally marked in the Soviet era and revived by President Boris Yeltsin for the 50th anniversary in 1995, but it was Vladimir Putin in 2008 who made it an annual event featuring military hardware. Russian identity has been largely created with Victory Day in the background, with schoolbooks and history books focusing on Russia as Europe's wartime liberators. ""Even in a normal year it's a huge show of Russia strength, of Putin's control and everything he stands for,"" says Ammon Cheskin of Glasgow University. ""And that's just amplified this year."" Claims that he will declare an end to the campaign have been denied, as have reports that he will announce a full declaration of war or a mobilisation of Russian men. Russia's military would not ""artificially adjust"" its actions to any particular date, said Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov. Something short of full mobilisation could be announced, in response to Russia's big losses on the battlefield. Dozens of ads have appeared on job websites in recent weeks looking for ""specialists in mobilisation work"", but such a step could hit the president's popularity and 9 May might not be the right time to announce it. After Russia annexed Crimea in 2014, Vladimir Putin marked Victory Day with a speech in Red Square about defeating fascism, before flying to the Black Sea port of Sevastopol to celebrate his new victory in front of thousands of onlookers. ""This year the primary objective was to announce the victory that was supposed to happen in February,"" says Ernest Wyciszkiewicz of the Centre for Polish-Russian Dialogue and Understanding. ""They are preparing a PR stunt for Monday: it's important for Russians to see that the special military operation they have been hearing about has led to something tangible."" Instead of celebrating the overthrow of Ukraine's government, the Kremlin will have to settle for the capture of most of Mariupol. The city may lie in ruins, but Russia has repeatedly talked of ""de-Nazification and demilitarisation"" of Ukraine and it may claim defeat of the Azov battalion, which it has falsely portrayed as Nazi. That would resonate on a day marking World War Two. ""In Russian cities and regional capitals we can see signs with the Victory Day symbol,"" says Olga Irisova, co-founder of analysis group Riddle Russia. ""Usually the signs say 9 May 1945 but this year it's 1945/2022, so they're trying to provide people with the idea that once again they're standing up to Nazis."" In Mariupol itself there will be no Victory Day parade because of apparent security threats. Russia's proxy leader in the region, Denis Pushilin, has said a parade will have to wait until Mariupol becomes part of his so-called Donetsk People's Republic. There will be unspecified festive events, though, and it could feature prominently in Russian coverage. In the run-up to 9 May the city has had visits from Kremlin TV spin doctor Vladimir Solovyov and a delegation from the Kremlin led by the president's deputy chief of staff, Sergei Kiryenko. War in Ukraine: More coverageWhy 9 May is so important for Russia The Red Square Victory Day parade is about aesthetics too, and military hardware in particular. It is a chance for the Kremlin to show off its latest weaponry. It was the Armata T-14 tank that turned heads on Victory Day in 2015, but it has been conspicuous by its absence in the war in Ukraine, because it is not yet ready for frontline combat. Ukraine says it has destroyed well over 1,000 less modern Russian tanks on the battlefield. There will be less hardware and fewer troops this year than in 2021. But there will still be some 10,000 troops and 129 pieces of military equipment, according to an analysis by BBC Russian. Gone will be one of Russia's newest tanks, the T-80BVM, as well as the Pantsir-S1 anti-aircraft missile system. The aerial display will be just as big as before, with 77 planes and helicopters, and the air force has been rehearsing over Red Square in a Z-formation - the controversial symbol adopted by invading forces. But there will be no foreign leaders this year, which the Kremlin puts down to the 77th anniversary not being a significant event in itself. Most of the messaging around Victory Day is directed at the Russian population anyway, says Olga Irisova. By harnessing the Nazi narrative from World War Two, the Kremlin is able to stir up strong feelings because most Russians have relatives who either died or struggled in the war. While events will take place across Russia, in neighbouring countries 9 May has become less and less significant. Ukraine saw some of the greatest losses in the war and a recent opinion poll suggested that the date should be seen as a day of remembrance rather than victory. Kazakhstan has cancelled its military parade for a third year running and Latvia has declared it a day of remembrance - for victims of Russia's war in Ukraine. "

Up to 20 refugees will be able to enrol on a one-year, full-time Masters course in a range of subjects. Their course and application fees will be waived, accommodation and meals will be covered, and they will be given a £7,500 grant to support their costs. The university's vice-chancellor said it had been left ""horrified"" by the Russian invasion. Prof Louise Richardson said: ""Our community is united in our desire to do something to help. ""These scholarships represent our effort to provide an opportunity to students and academics whose scholarship has been disrupted by the war. ""We look forward to welcoming colleagues from Ukraine."" The scholarships will be co-funded by the university and participating colleges. Baroness Jan Royall, Somerville College's principal and chair of the university's Conference of Colleges, said the war is causing ""immense suffering and long-term repercussions for those affected"". ""It has been inspiring to see the speed and unanimity with which the colleges have rallied to support this important new programme,"" she said. ""In time, there will be more for us to do in order to lessen the impact of this terrible war - but this scheme will give Ukrainian students a chance to rebuild their lives now, which is invaluable."" The university and colleges said they are still providing welfare support for students who have been affected by the conflict in Ukraine and have given out financial support ""where necessary"". It said it was also offering support for Ukrainian applicants who are due to start their Oxford courses in October but whose education or finances have been impacted by the conflict.

Sarah and Helen Barley-McMullen, from Belper, Derbyshire, made contact with a couple who fled Kyiv in March. The two women - one of whom is Russian - have been staying in Berlin awaiting visas and paperwork to allow them to travel to the UK. Sarah said: ""We are so relieved and absolutely over the moon."" The couple - Yulia and Tatiana - have been together for 10 years. They worked as translators in Ukraine until they were forced to flee. Sarah said: ""They are exhausted. They said that when they left Kyiv, they could hear the bombs. They both only took a rucksack and a bag each of belongings, so they could run if they needed to. ""They are very keen to support other refugees in Derbyshire with their translation skills."" Sarah said she and her wife offered them a home because they feared LGBT refugees may face additional persecution. Sarah said: ""When you think of the trauma people from Ukraine are going through, it was a no-brainer for us. ""We are happy to give a home to anybody but we wanted to shine a spotlight on LGBT refugees."" The couple have also set up a Facebook group called Out!standing for Ukraine where people can offer support for LGBT refugees. Yulia and Tatiana were helped in their journey to the UK by Conservative MP for Mid Derbyshire Pauline Latham. She said: ""I am delighted that the LGBT Ukrainians have made it to Belper. ""I know they will receive a very warm welcome there.

Unnamed officials said Ukraine had asked the US about a ship sailing to the south of Odesa. The US said it was the Moskva and helped confirm its location. Ukraine then struck it with two missiles. The Pentagon has not commented. But a spokesman said the US gave intelligence to help Ukraine defend itself. The unnamed US officials quoted in media reports said they did not know that Ukraine would target the Moskva after helping determine its location. The 510-crew missile cruiser had led Russia's naval assault on Ukraine, and its sinking was a major symbolic and military blow. At the time, the Russian defence ministry said ammunition on board the Moskva exploded in an unexplained fire and the ship tipped over while being towed back to port. The US is yet to directly address the reports about the Moskva. However Pentagon spokesman John Kirby denied earlier media reports that the US was providing information about the locations of senior Russian generals on the battlefield, so that Ukrainian forces could kill them. ""We do not provide intelligence on the location of senior military leaders on the battlefield or participate in the targeting decisions of the Ukrainian military,"" he said. Mr Kirby said Ukraine combined information that the US and others provided with their own battlefield intelligence. ""Then they make their own decisions, and they take their own actions,"" he said. The White House National Security Council (NSC) also denied the US was helping Ukraine target senior Russian officers. ""We do not provide intelligence with the intent to kill Russian generals,"" NSC spokesperson Adrienne Watson said. The Biden administration is ramping up support for Ukraine. President Biden has asked Congress for $33bn (£27bn) in military, economic and humanitarian assistance to support Ukraine, while insisting that the US was not ""attacking Russia"". The sum is more than twice as much as the US has already spent on providing military equipment and humanitarian aid. The BBC's North America Editor Sarah Smith says Mr Biden wants to show he is undeterred by vague threats about the possible use of nuclear weapons, and a warning from Vladimir Putin that there could be retaliatory strikes against countries that intervene in Ukraine. Russia's foreign ministry has said Western military support for Ukraine threatens ""the security of the continent"". "

About 200 civilians are also believed to be hiding in bunkers in the plant. UN chief Antonio Guterres said everything should be done to ""get people out of these hellscapes"". Russia's Vladimir Putin said his forces are ready to give civilians safe passage, but fighters must surrender. The Russian president has already declared victory in Mariupol, ordering his forces to seal off the sprawling industrial site - which was designed during the Cold War to serve as a nuclear bunker and has a network of tunnels deep below ground - rather than try to take control of it. However the remaining Ukrainian forces inside the steelworks - fighters from the Azov regiment, some marines, border guards and police - say Russian attacks are continuing. In his overnight address Ukraine's President Zelensky also said that Russian shelling and attempts to wrest control of the steelworks were ongoing. ""Just imagine this hell. And there are children! More than two months of constant shelling, bombing, constant death nearby,"" he said. The Azov regiment released drone footage showing explosions at the steelworks, but the date of the footage could not be verified. Earlier on Thursday Sviatoslav Palamar, an Azov regiment commander, said Ukrainian defenders were fighting ""difficult, bloody battles"" with Russian troops who had managed to enter part of the complex. But the Kremlin denied its forces had tried to storm the plant and insisted that a humanitarian corridor was open as part of a three-day ceasefire that started on Thursday. Mr Guterres said a third operation to evacuate civilians from the city was under way and would arrive in the city on Friday. Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said on social media that this would happen at about midday. At least 20 children are thought to be among the remaining civilians in the steelworks, and food and water supplies are dwindling fast. On Sunday an initial group of civilians was evacuated from the plant. Footage showed mainly women and children being helped to walk over piles of rubble, and boarding a bus with missing windows. Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine 10 weeks ago but has not yet gained full control over any of Ukraine's major cities. In other developments: Are you or your family in Mariupol?

Moscow had promised a three-day truce, but is said to be attacking the plant, where some 200 civilians are still trapped with the Ukrainian soldiers. This is where most of the developments on the ground have been today. But a lot has been happening elsewhere. A row between Russia and Israel - centring on Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov's remarks that Nazi leader Adolf Hitler had ""Jewish blood"" - appears to have been mended during a phone call between Mr Putin and Israeli PM Naftali Bennett. Mr Bennett's office said the prime minister had accepted an apology from Mr Putin - even though the Kremlin's account of the conversation did not mention an apology. Read the full story and the background here. Last week, three buses staffed by volunteers set off for Popasna in eastern Ukraine, hoping to save some of the trapped civilians near the front line. Only one returned. ""We've been going quite close to the front and evacuating blind people, people with walking frames. I'm quite scared most of the time,"" said Guy Osborn, a visiting British maths teacher volunteering to help. Read more about the fate of the missing rescuers from the BBC's Andrew Harding. For weeks, Western nations have made much of the sanctions they've placed on Russia's wealthy and powerful as a response to the war. But it's emerged that many of those wealthy Russians have been moving to Dubai in the United Arab Emirates - a haven that has not put any sanctions on Russia. Russian billionaires and entrepreneurs have been arriving there in unprecedented numbers, the BBC has been told. One company who helps clients set up there said: ""We are receiving five times more enquiries from Russians...moving here to secure their wealth."" Since the early days of the war, charities have been raising funds for Ukrainians affected by the crisis. But now, a BBC investigation has found hundreds of fake websites - some using the branding of reputable charities - designed to pocket donations for scammers. One site was traced to a man based in Nigeria, who deleted it when contacted by the BBC, and another used the real social media profile of a genuine, real-life fundraiser in the scam.

Here's what the display of military might is all about, and why it's important. Oil and gas prices are skyrocketing in part due to the invasion of Ukraine, since Russia is one of the world's big sources of both. But energy giant Shell tripled its year-on-year profits for the first quarter, making $9.13bn (£7.3bn) in three months.

Speaking through a translator Mr Vashchynski, joined by his wife Svetlana, and children Polina, five, and baby Sofia, said the ""trees and the greenery"" were ""all new"" to them. He said he hoped his children would ""love it here and that everyone will be content and happy in the new arrangements"". Mr Frankl's Jewish parents sought refuge in the UK from Nazi Germany during World War Two. He said: ""I'm actually quite emotional because I realise that my parents went through something similar. ""There's that in the background and all the way through we've been battling this bureaucracy to bring them here safe. What is more fulfilling than that?"" Mr Frankl said he was told the delays in moving the family were due to the refugee couple's five-year-old daughter needing extra safeguarding checks. But he called the system ""atrocious"" and ""designed to fail"". The Home Office said ""vital robust safeguarding processes"" were in place ""to protect children from trafficking and other risks"". A spokesperson added: ""The Home Office has made changes to streamline the application process so that thousands of visas are now being granted every day."" The Vashchynskis no longer have a home to return to after the Russian bombing of their city. Mr Frankl said Mr Vashchynski was able to leave Ukraine because he moved to Hungary for work in January so had left the country prior to the Russian invasion.

He told the AP news agency that the operation had ""dragged on"". Belarus shares a border with Ukraine and Russia sent troops from there when it launched its invasion. Russia's Vladimir Putin helped Mr Lukashenko cling to power in 2020 after his widely disputed presidential re-election sparked mass protests. In turn, Belarus's long-time leader has given his backing to Russia's invasion and critics have said he is little more than a vassal and accomplice to Mr Putin. In his interview with AP, Mr Lukashenko said that Russia's leader had no choice but to act because Ukraine was ""provoking Russia"". But he added: ""I am not immersed in this problem enough to say whether it goes according to plan, like the Russians say, or like I feel it. ""I want to stress one more time: I feel like this operation has dragged on."" Mr Lukashenko said he wanted the war to end, saying Belarus had ""done and are doing everything"" to stop it. By calling it a war, he went further than Russia's own description of its invasion as a ""special military operation"". Moscow has justified the war as an effort to ""demilitarise and de-Nazify"" Ukraine - which is considered a baseless pretext. Mr Lukashenko also said that any suggestion that Russia might use nuclear weapons against Ukraine was ""unacceptable because it's right next to us"", but added he did not know whether Moscow intended to use them. Although Belarus has provided a platform for Russian forces it has not sent its own troops in. On Wednesday it began snap military drills which it said posed no threat to Ukraine. Belarus was already under Western sanctions following the 2020 election, and faces further measures over its role in the conflict. It was one of only a handful of countries to back Russia's invasion at an emergency UN vote. Out of the 193 UN member states, 141 condemned the war, with some major countries like China and India choosing to abstain. "

SCHol Tech are installing the Ukrainian language onto computers and delivering them across Somerset. The Taunton-based group of IT specialists have been refurbishing donated laptops since early 2021. Student Yulia Haidenko, whose Kharkiv university is continuing online, said her new device ""will be very useful"". The 18-year-old said the university had been destroyed during the Russian invasion but lessons were still taking place. Her host Ruth Knowlman said the laptops would help her guests set up essentials such as online bank accounts. She said laptops were ""a big thing to carry"" out of Ukraine. ""They've [refugees] come with so little and had to leave so much behind that this is a huge help."" The scheme was started in early 2021 by Bridgwater father-of-three, Dan Taylor, who wanted to provide free computers for schoolchildren taking classes online during the second coronavirus lockdown. It is now run by Tim Finch, Carl Molyneux and Brian Tagg who all live in the Taunton and Wellington area. The team of IT professionals have collected, processed, and then delivered more than 210 free laptops with the support of local volunteers. On Thursday the first three Ukrainian language laptops were handed to refugees who had arrived in the area after fleeing their homeland. ""Initially for the pandemic it was obviously an education crisis, people trying to home-school children without devices,"" said Mr Molyneux. ""We came to the end of lockdowns and we found the demand was still there so we've just kept going,"" he added. Mr Finch said: ""We did wonder, after helping something like 150 families in the area during the lockdown, whether our initiative would be short-lived. ""However, the new cost-of-living crisis, and now the refugee situation, raised the importance of continuing to help those in our area most in need."" The team have adapted the laptops so they can be switched easily between English and Ukrainian, put together with feedback from a local Ukrainian resident. Mr Molyneux said this allowed them to prepare laptops specific to the needs of both Eastern and Western Ukrainians. ""We hope this is just the start of our ability to provide native language machines to refugees from other nations who come here, often with very little,"" he added.

372,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-61330552,2022-05-05T14:12:32,Shell profits nearly triple as oil prices surge," Energy giant Shell has reported its highest ever quarterly profits as oil and gas prices surge around the world. Shell made $9.13bn (£7.3bn) in the first three months of the year, nearly triple its $3.2bn profit it announced for the same period last year. But the firm said pulling out of Russian oil and gas due to the Ukraine conflict had cost it $3.9bn (£3.1bn). On Tuesday, rival BP also reported a sharp rise in profit, but the UK has so far ruled out a windfall tax. The invasion of Ukraine has helped oil and gas prices skyrocket. Russia is one of the world's major exporters but Western nations have pledged to cut their dependence on the country for energy. Oil prices were already rising before the Ukraine war as economies started to recover from the Covid pandemic. Shell chief executive Ben van Beurden said the war in Ukraine had caused ""significant disruption to global energy markets"". ""The impacts of this uncertainty and the higher cost that comes with it are being felt far and wide. ""We have been engaging with governments, our customers and suppliers to work through the challenging implications and provide support and solutions where we can."" Shell rivals, including BP and TotalEnergies have also reported a sharp rise in underlying profits. Norway's Equinor, which supplies a quarter of the UK's gas, also posted record earnings on Wednesday. Shell's profits were expected to be big. The price of oil and gas, already high at the end of last year, surged higher after the Russian invasion of Ukraine threatened disruption and eventual boycotts of one of the world's biggest suppliers of energy. These numbers surpassed those lofty expectations. The question now is what Shell will do with all this money. The company paid out £4.3bn to shareholders, which include millions of pension savers, in the last quarter and said it plans to dish out roughly the same in the next three months. Shell has already said it will invest £20bn to £25bn in the UK in the next decade in low carbon energy and in UK gas and oil supplies. Ministers will be watching closely to make sure Shell delivers on those commitments. It's the promise of investment that is standing between UK oil and gas companies and the windfall tax opposition parties have called for but the government has so far resisted. The high prices of oil and gas are pushing up the cost of living around the world. In the UK, inflation is running at 7%, its highest rate for 30 years, as energy bills, fuel costs and food prices jump. The Bank of England raised interest rates on Thursday to try to temper inflation. One of the main contributors to UK inflation has been fuel prices, which are near record highs and could stay that way for months, according to some analysts. Demand for diesel has grown as the popularity of online shopping deliveries remains high, and inventories are low in the US and Europe. Russia is a major exporter of diesel, but the Ukraine invasion has made access to that limited. As part of Western sanctions, the European Union has proposed a total ban on Russian oil imports. Mr van Beurden said Shell was ""ahead of a ban or a boycott"" by getting out of its positions in Russia. The firm is in the process of ending all of its joint ventures with the Russian energy company Gazprom, as well as pulling out of its Russian petrol station and other businesses. He said a complete ban or boycott of Russian gas would be a ""major disaster"" which would leave a ""supply hole"" in Europe. Russia has demanded that payments for gas be made in roubles to try to prop up the currency, but the EU has said that may contravene sanctions. Mr van Beurden said that Shell will ""continue paying to the end of May and will have to see what happens after that"", adding that the firm will operate within sanctions. The UK government has so far ruled out a windfall tax on the oil companies, despite calls from opposition parties for one to be imposed. The Shell boss said that if a windfall tax was imposed on North Sea oil and gas profits, Shell would be unlikely to shelve UK green investment plans such as building more electric vehicle charging. Nevertheless, he added that Shell's plans would ""have to make economic sense when it comes to making those investment decisions on the day"". Shell plans to invest $25bn over the next decade, with 75% in green technologies, and the rest in oil and gas projects, including in the North Sea. The company's chief financial officer, Sinead Gorman, said its North Sea plans would see more ""energy security"" for the UK. However, Mr van Beurden acknowledged that oil firms sell their products on international markets, and that developing North Sea oil would not necessarily lower prices. "

Fake sites have used the branding of charities such as Save the Children. Some scammers have even pretended to be getting equipment to soldiers on the front line. One charity boss called the practice ""awful"" and said it was taking money from children in need around the world. The investigation identified a bogus site, calling itself Save Life Direct - which claimed to have raised $100,000 (£80,000) - was registered to a man based in Abuja, in Nigeria. When he was traced and contacted by the BBC, he initially claimed he was sending donations to a ""friend"" in western Ukraine. Later, he admitted he hadn't raised $100,000 at all. He said he would provide proof the site was real but he did not - and the following day, the website was taken down. Many of the scams use emotionally-charged language, including pretending to be real people in Ukraine in need of help. One bogus site had stolen the details of a real organisation raising cash for the Ukrainian military - putting up an alternative address, controlled by the scammers, to which money could be sent. It even used the real Facebook profiles of genuine Ukrainian fundraisers, including one belonging to Tanya Tarasevich - whose job is to get supplies to fighters on the front line. She said she was appalled by their actions: ""It's the worst thing you can do to a person, when in your country little children are dying and your country is all on fire. It's a crime."" Jack Whittaker, an expert in online scams who is completing a PhD at the University of Surrey, said there were hundreds of these websites, showing a ""high degree of success"". His research shows scammers are always looking for a new opportunity. ""They simply have the TV on and they look for the next big thing that they can attach themselves to, in this case the perfect opportunity was the Ukrainian crisis"". The BBC's investigation also found the logos and branding of the charity Save the Children had been stolen and used to create a fake website. Chris Saul, from Save the Children, said the ""generosity of the British public is being taken advantage of"". ""There's also the children, who we work with around the world, who are not going to get the support they need,"" he added. "

Ian and Roberta Gould, from Chester, have been trying for six weeks to host a mother, daughter and cousin fleeing from war-torn Ukraine. Mrs Gould said the application for 17-year-old Viktoria was declined because she was travelling without a parent. The Home Office said unaccompanied minors are only eligible if reuniting with a legal guardian in the UK. The Goulds chose to open up their second home to help refugees after war started in Ukraine in February. They applied to sponsor Natalia, Davina and Victoria, who have been in Poland since escaping the conflict six weeks ago. Mr Gould even flew to Poland a week ago to reassure the family of their offer. He said: ""I got in touch with the [government] hotline. Nobody ever responds. Not a word. ""What on earth do [the refugees] feel now after wasting six weeks? ""They could have been in another country that welcomes them. Why can't we show some humanity?"" Mrs Gould added: ""Now what is their choice? Do they leave the 17-year-old in a strange, foreign country that she can't speak the language of? ""She can't go back to Ukraine because both her parents are fighting. What happens to her? Where does she go?"" A spokesperson for the Home Office said: ""Due to safeguarding concerns, unaccompanied minors are only eligible under the Homes for Ukraine scheme if they are reuniting with a parent or legal guardian in the UK."" The Goulds said that their experience of trying to help the refugees had been one of the toughest of their lives and they ""burst into tears"" when the visa application for Viktoria was turned down. Mr Gould said: ""I'm nearly 70. I've had the full range of life's experiences and nothing has stressed us out as much as this. ""We haven't slept properly for at least a month just worrying about them."" Why not follow BBC North West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram?

Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole (BCP) Council's guide is available in Ukrainian, Russian and Polish. It has information about support payments, how to open a bank account, getting children into schools and registering with a doctor. The council has also created an information pack for sponsors.

Lilya and her six boys, aged between four and 14, are waiting to come to Monmouthshire. But visa delays mean they could soon lose their temporary home in Romania. The Home Office said it had streamlined the system and was working as fast as it can. Lilya and her sons lived in a village in central Ukraine. Before the invasion, Lilya lost her four-year-old daughter Liza, her son Dmytro's twin, in a house fire. Her severely disabled daughter, Vladochka, died when she was 13. So when the latest Russian invasion began, she said she knew she had to get her family out. ""I know what it's like to lose a child,"" she said. ""When the war started, we were still at home for a while, hoping that these hostilities would end quickly, as we had been told we will win in a week or two. ""When the situation worsened, I simply had no choice but to try to put my children in a safe place, because I didn't want to lose more children."" As the invasion continued into March, Lilya read a BBC Wales story about plans to house up to eight Ukrainian refugees in a refurbished bungalow on the site of a primary school in Wales. She got in contact with Phil Cotterell, chairman of the school's governors, who then sponsored the family to come to Wales. Lilya said she was ""thankful to God"" for his help and the work of volunteers in Wales. Her next struggle was to get herself and her boys out of Ukraine. Her initial plan was to travel to Odesa on the Black Sea, but heavy shelling made the route unsafe. Eventually, she found someone to take them to Romania, arriving at the border in the middle of the night. They found help and a place to stay in the Romanian capital, Bucharest. But the family's goal was to reach the bungalow in Wales. ""When I saw the photo and learned that people are raising money and making renovations, I was amazed... especially the photo where they already bought toothbrushes and toothpaste,"" she said. ""Every day they ask how my day went... I know that there are very wonderful people living there."" Lilya said she looked up the town on the internet and was looking forward to going there. ""We saw the castle, but only in the photo. I want to visit it and get acquainted with the people of this city,"" she said. ""We hope that we will not only be guests but will be able to become part of society and benefit people."" She said she associated the UK with castles and knights and described Mr Cotterell as a ""noble knight"". As she waited in Romania, Lilya said she felt the visa process was ""taking too long"". The bungalow, meanwhile, has been transformed from being a storage space to a welcoming home, with a cosy lounge, new carpets and three bedrooms. People have done painting, gardening and fundraising, while local businesses have helped to cover the cost of the family's travel and accommodation in Bucharest. Mr Cotterell has asked the home secretary to step in, as the family's current accommodation in Romania is only available until 1 May. ""I would like to say to Priti Patel, to the home secretary, as a mum, can you intervene in this family's plight and get her on a flight to the UK before May 1st,"" Mr Cotterell asked. ""This family has gone through horrendous horror in escaping the war."" He said there was ""anticipation"" but also the ""frustration"" over the weeks the family has had to wait. ""We have done everything possible through the system to the letter, I've had an enhanced DBS check, and the family has completed all the process,"" he said. ""What I found mind-blowing is, how do seven people present their applications at the same time but they can't be processed at the same time?"" Other families having problems with visas, including applications being ""lost,"" have been raised in the House of Commons by the Cardiff North MP, Anna McMorrin. The latest Home Office figures show 2,314 visas had been issued to people wanting to come to Wales as part of the UK government's Homes for Ukraine sponsorship scheme. The figures, which are broken down by local authority area, indicated that Cardiff had the most visas issued, at 162. Blaenau Gwent had the least with five. A total of 669 visas have been approved after being sponsored by the Welsh Government. There are no figures on arrivals to Wales but of the 86,100 visas issued by the UK government, 27,100 people have arrived. A UK government said the UK was at the ""forefront of supporting those fleeing Ukraine"" with staff deployed to visa application centres across the EU, where they are ""providing advice and supporting people through the process as fast as [they] can"". A spokesperson added: ""In just six weeks, almost 72,000 visas have been issued so Ukrainians can live and work in the UK. ""The changes the Home Office has made to streamline the visa system, including simplifying the forms and boosting staff numbers, are working and we are now processing visas as quickly as they come in, enabling thousands more Ukrainians to come through our uncapped routes.""

Russian billionaires and entrepreneurs have been arriving in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) in unprecedented numbers, business leaders told the BBC. Property purchases in Dubai by Russians surged by 67% in the first three months of 2022, a report said. The UAE has not put sanctions on Russia or criticised its invasion of Ukraine. It is also providing visas to non-sanctioned Russians while many Western countries have restricted them. It is estimated that hundreds of thousands of people have left Russia over the last two months - although exact figures are not available. One Russian economist said as many as 200,000 Russians had left in the first 10 days after the war began. Virtuzone, which helps companies to set up operations in Dubai, has seen a huge surge of Russian clients. ""We are receiving five times more enquiries from Russians since the war began,"" said chief executive George Hojeige. ""They are worried about an economic meltdown that's coming. That is why they are moving here to secure their wealth,"" he added. The influx of Russian nationals has bolstered demand for luxury villas and apartments across the city. Real estate agents are reporting a surge in property prices, as Russians arriving in Dubai are looking to purchase homes. Dubai-based real estate agency Betterhomes found property purchases by Russians surged by two thirds in the first three months of 2022. And another real estate agency, Modern Living, told the BBC it had hired many Russian-speaking agents to cater to rising demand. Chief executive Thiago Caldas said they were receiving numerous calls from Russian nationals looking to relocate to Dubai immediately. ""Russians who are coming down are not buying just for investment, they are looking at Dubai as a second home,"" he said. Many multinational companies and Russian start-ups are also relocating their employees to the UAE. Fuad Fatullaev is the co-founder of WeWay - a blockchain technology company that had offices in Russia and Ukraine. After the war broke out, he and his partners shifted hundreds of employees to Dubai. ""The war had a massive impact on our operations. We couldn't continue [as we were] as we had to move hundreds of people outside of Ukraine and Russia,"" says Mr Fatullaev, who is a Russian citizen. He adds that they chose to shift their employees to the UAE as it offers a safe economic and political environment to operate a business. He said Russian businesses were moving out as they were finding it incredibly difficult to operate due to sanctions. The challenge was even more acute for companies dealing with international clients and brands, as most western firms have severed ties with Russian-based enterprises, he said. Global firms like Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan and Google that have shut down offices in Russia, are also relocating some of their employees to Dubai. ""There is definitely a brain drain that is happening. A lot of people are leaving because there are a lot of business restrictions right now,"" says Mr Fatullaev . Russia's central bank is barred from tapping into the billions of foreign reserves held overseas in foreign banks. Some Russian banks have been removed from the Swift financial messaging system. To protect its reserves, the Russian government has enacted capital restrictions and banned citizens from exiting the country with more than $10,000 in foreign currency. Finding it difficult to transfer cash, a lot of Russian buyers are making payments in cryptocurrencies. Some of the purchasers have an intermediary who will take the payment in crypto and then pass on the cash to the seller on behalf of the buyer. Gulf states including the UAE and Saudi Arabia have rejected calls from western governments to impose sanctions on Russia. The UAE was one of only three countries, along with China and India, to abstain in a United Nations Security Council vote in February to condemn Russia's invasion of Ukraine. It also abstained in a General Assembly vote on 7 April to suspend Russia from the UN Human Rights Council. The rise in Russian investment comes just months after the UAE was placed on a ""grey list"" by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), a global financial crime watchdog. It means the country faces increased monitoring of its efforts to counter money laundering and terrorist financing. The UAE government has claimed to have taken significant measures to regulate inbound investment, and has stated that it remains committed to working closely with FATF on areas for improvement. "

CJ Darton, who used to be an infantryman for the Royal Anglian regiment, is with Ukrainian teams and police finding and decommissioning explosives. In one day, Mr Darton, from Norfolk, said he had made 300 mortars safe. He said he was ""glad"" to be able to ""bring [my skills] to the table"". ""Ultimately every fuse that you touch, every shell that you touch, there is a 50% chance that it's going to actuate in your hands or detonate,"" he said. ""A lot of them are damaged."" His work had involved a controlled explosion of a tank turret, he said, which had a live shell stuck inside. Mr Darton said the Ukrainians did not ""have the boots on the ground"" to do this kind of clearance so had joined ""with the police to bring our knowledge, skills and expertise in the explosive world"". The ex-soldier understood he was risking his own life. ""It's a very dangerous game what we are doing,"" he said, but added he was looking at the longer term. ""If we don't do what we're doing, a year, two years', five years' time, 10 years' time, if a group of children go running through the woods that haven't been checked, been cleared, then there's going to be more bodies,"" said Mr Darton. Mr Darton said the team he was working with had no equipment, so were using sticks to search for trip wires. ""It needs to be done. I'm in a position to be able to help. It's a unique set of skills and qualifications that a lot of people out here don't have so I'm glad I can bring it to the table,"" Mr Darton said. The former soldier said the situation in Ukraine was worse than that being broadcast. Bodies on the streets were all too common, he said. ""Obviously I've served in Afghanistan, I think I was fairly desensitised to that kind of thing anyway, [but] it's not nice to see."" Mr Darton said he was prepared to stand alongside the Ukrainians on the front line for as long as it takes. Find BBC News: East of England on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

Ukrainian forces inside the plant have been fighting ""difficult bloody battles"" for a second day, the commander of the Azov regiment said. Russian forces are reported to have entered ""the territory of the plant"" after days of sustained attacks. About 200 civilians are believed to be sheltering inside, including children. The BBC has not been able to verify the reports of the Russian attack on the steel plant. In a brief video message posted on Telegram, Azov commander Denis Prokopenko said: ""I am proud of my soldiers who are making superhuman efforts to contain the pressure of the enemy... the situation is extremely difficult."" President Volodymyr Zelensky has made a further appeal to the UN to help save the lives of those who remain there. ""Everyone is important to us. We ask for your help in saving them,"" Mr Zelensky told UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres in a phone call. The Ukrainian leader thanked Mr Guterres for a successful UN and Red Cross-led evacuation this week, which rescued more than 100 people from the steelworks, but called on the UN to ""assist in the removal of all the wounded from Azovstal"". There were also more evacuations from other areas - Ukraine's deputy prime minister said that 344 evacuees from various south-western cities including Mariupol arrived in the relative safety of Zaporizhzhia on Wednesday - a south-eastern city still under Ukrainian control. In a post on Telegram, Irina Vereshchuk thanked the UN and Red Cross for their help, saying: ""These are women, children and elderly people from Mariupol, Manhush, Berdiansk, Tokmak and Vasylivka... We will now support them during this difficult time, including with much-needed psychological support."" Osnat Lubrani, the UN's humanitarian coordinator for Ukraine, confirmed the evacuations. ""While this second evacuation of civilians from areas in Mariupol and beyond is significant, much more must be done to make sure all civilians caught up in fighting can leave, in the direction they wish,"" she said in a statement. Russia has said it will implement a ceasefire from Thursday to allow more civilian evacuations from the Azovstal plant. The Russian military said routes out of the plant would open from 08:00 to 18:00 Moscow time (05:00 to 15:00 GMT) on 5, 6, and 7 May. During this time, Russian forces will cease activities and withdraw units to a safe distance, the military said in a post online. Meanwhile, new analysis suggests many as 600 people were killed when Russia bombed a theatre in Mariupol in March. The attack is believed to have caused the worst known loss of life in a single strike since the invasion began. An investigation by the Associated Press (AP) news agency now puts the death toll at about double the previous estimate of 300. AP spoke to 23 survivors, rescuers and those familiar with the theatre's use as a bomb shelter. Russian troops have spent weeks besieging and bombarding Mariupol, which is key to Moscow's military campaign in Ukraine. Full control of the city would give the Russians a land bridge from Russia, through parts of the Donbas region held by Russian-backed separatists, right through to Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014. Despite indications that Russia is making slow progress in its effort to invade and retain southern and eastern parts of the country, the Kremlin has dismissed speculation that it will declare all-out war in Ukraine in the coming days as ""nonsense"". Moscow has up until now denied it is at war, instead referring to the invasion as a ""special military operation"". But Western officials have speculated that President Vladimir Putin could use the 9 May Victory Parade to announce an escalation of military action. Moscow has denied this. "

The toughest sanctions to come out of Brussels yet will see Russian crude oil imports phased out within six months. But the measures need to be approved by EU members, and Hungary says it will veto the measures in their current form. Paul Kirby from our Europe desk has the full story. Also facing new EU sanctions are Russian military officers suspected of war crimes in Ukraine. The measures are designed to damage Russia's economy and penalise President Vladimir Putin, high-ranking officials and those who have benefited from his rule. Apart from oil and war crimes suspects they target some of Russia's top banks, disconnecting them from the international payments system Swift, used to transfer money across borders. And three of Russia's state-owned broadcasters are banned from the EU on cable, satellite and the internet. Read more about how sanctions work and what action has already been taken in our explainer. The EU accepts that it isn't going to be easy to get rid of Russian oil and few countries are as keenly aware of the challenge as Germany. Our correspondent Damien McGuinness has been to Schwedt to see for himself the refinery at the heart of Russia's oil supply. While people in the the oil town stand behind Ukraine and understand the urgency of moving away from Russian energy, there are fears closing down the site could destroy the local economy. On 9 May Russia marks Victory Day, which commemorates the defeat of the Nazis and the end of World War Two. Western officials have speculated that President Vladimir Putin might have plans for a major announcement that day - in particular, declaring that Russia is at war with Ukraine. Moscow has up until now denied it is at war, instead referring to the invasion as a ""special military operation"". Such a move might signal a major escalation in the conflict. Russia on Wednesday dismissed the rumours as ""nonsense"". But as the BBC's Security Correspondent Frank Gardner notes, Russia denials need to be taken with a pinch of salt. On the ground in the east fighting continues. In the port of Mariupol, Ukrainian soldiers remain under siege at a steel works, while Russian forces are said to be advancing around the town of Izyum. But around the city of Kharkiv, Ukrainian forces are reported to be pushing Russian troops back. The war is not confined to the east, though: Ukraine has reported nearly 50 Russian air strikes across the country on Tuesday alone. We've been tracking the war with maps. There are claims that thousands of disabled Ukrainian children have been forgotten and abandoned in institutions that can't look after them. The human rights organisation, Disability Rights International, has carried out an investigation and found children with severe disabilities tied to beds in overrun children's homes unable to cope. The BBC has been given exclusive access to an institution in western Ukraine, where disabled children from the east have been left by their carers who fled to neighbouring countries. A 12-year-old schoolboy called Thomas in the English city of Durham wrote to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to say he was on the country's side and that Mr Zelensky was ""the best president"". The letter was among 270 parcels of medical supplies, clothing, food, toiletries and four wheelchairs donated by pupils from Durham Trinity School and Sports College, which helps youngsters with a wide range of additional learning needs. The convoy was driven in a cattle truck to a refugee reception centre last month, which was set up at the East Warsaw railway station in Poland to help Ukrainians fleeing the conflict. Despite not expecting a reply, his school received one last week, in which the Ukrainian leader thanked him for his support.

381,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-61321799,2022-05-04T19:57:08,Ukraine war: Russia denies it plans to declare war on 9 May," Russia has dismissed speculation that it will declare all-out war in Ukraine in the coming days as ""nonsense"". Moscow has up until now denied it is at war, instead referring to the invasion as a ""special military operation"". But Western officials have speculated that President Vladimir Putin could use the 9 May Victory Parade to announce an escalation of military action. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, however, said there was no truth to the rumours ""at all"". UK Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said last week that the Moscow parade - commemorating the defeat of the Nazis and end of World War Two - might be used to drum up support for a mass mobilisation of troops and renewed push into Ukraine. ""I would not be surprised, and I don't have any information about this, that he is probably going to declare on this May Day that 'we are now at war with the world's Nazis and we need to mass mobilise the Russian people',"" he told LBC radio. Russian officials only refer to the invasion as a ""special military operation"" to ""demilitarise"" or ""de-Nazify"" the country, referencing a baseless claim about Nazis in the Ukrainian government which Moscow used to justify the invasion. As well as the annual parade in Moscow, there are also long-standing reports that the Kremlin is planning some sort of additional parade in the city of Mariupol in southern Ukraine, almost all of which is now under Russian control. Ukrainian forces remain in one area of the city - a vast industrial steelworks called Azovstal. Latest reports suggest that after the recent successful evacuation of some civilians, attacks on the steelworks have resumed and contact has been lost with the last remaining soldiers inside. Ukrainian officials say the streets of the city centre are being cleared of debris, bodies, and unexploded bombs. Large parts of the city lie in ruins, after Russian forces bombarded it relentlessly for weeks under siege. Ukrainian politician Alyona Shkrum told the BBC she was expecting things to become more difficult alongside Russia's victory day celebrations. ""For Putin and for the empire he's trying to build, basically this is a symbolic day, right?"" she said. ""So he takes some kind of victory day and he turns it into a big fight right now against Nazis, which is obviously Russian propaganda and completely ridiculous. ""We are expecting that there will be quite tough times here in Kyiv and in Odesa and in Mariupol, and in other cities for 9 May."" At the risk of stating the obvious, there is only one person who can be absolutely sure of how Russia plans to mark its annual Victory Day on 9 May and that is Vladimir Putin. And he is keeping his cards close to his chest. Moscow's denial that it plans to declare war that day need to be taken with a hefty pinch of salt. In the days leading up to the invasion on 24 February Russian officials queued up to ridicule suggestions of an imminent invasion as ""western hysteria and propaganda"". Yet invade they did, catching even many Ukrainians by surprise. So the very least we can expect is some triumphant announcements of objectives achieved and enemies (real or imagined) vanquished. Blame for the slow pace of Russian advance in the eastern Donbas region will likely be placed on Nato and there will probably be further warnings to the West to stop helping Ukraine defend itself. Whatever happens on 9 May it is hard to see this war ending any time soon. "
382,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-61318689,2022-05-04T19:31:03,Ukraine war: EU plans Russian oil ban and war crimes sanctions," The EU has proposed some of its toughest measures yet against Russia, including a total ban on oil imports and sanctions on war crimes suspects. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the package was aimed at maximising pressure on Russia while minimising damage to Europe. Russian crude oil would be phased out within six months, she said. Hungary has rejected the proposal as unacceptable and the Czech and Slovak governments want a transition period. The EU has been focusing for weeks on how to wean itself off Russian oil and gas. It has already pledged to reduce gas imports by two-thirds by the end of 2022 and now plans to phase out crude oil over six months and refined products by the end of 2022. ""We will make sure that we phase out Russian oil in an orderly fashion,"" the Commission president said. The package first has to be approved by EU ambassadors and is set to be signed off in the next few days. But Hungarian government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs said his country would veto it in its current form: ""They exactly know that what they are proposing is against Hungarian interests... and if we do that we are completely going to ruin the Hungarian economy."" Slovakia as well as Hungary currently relies on Russian oil and under the initial proposal would be given until the end of 2023 to find alternative suppliers. Slovakia's economy minister said his country wanted a three-year transition period, while Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala said he would also seek a two-to-three year exemption to tackle problems with pipeline capacity. Last year, Russia supplied the EU with a quarter of its oil imports, and the Netherlands and Germany were the biggest buyers. The Dutch government has said it wants to halt all Russian fossil fuel imports by the end of this year and Germany has drastically reduced its reliance on Russian oil imports, down from 35% to 12%. The UK, which is no longer in the EU, is already phasing out Russian oil, which accounts for 8% of its imports. German Economics Minister Robert Habeck has said the six-month transition period gives Berlin long enough to make the change. The problem for Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic is that they are all landlocked and rely on their neighbours for fuel supplies. Czech special envoy for energy security Vaclav Bartuska told the BBC that Europe was currently trying to redraw the map of energy supplies as fast as it could: ""We want to get rid of Russian crude once and for all and we want to be absolutely sure there'll be no need to go back and ask Russia again."" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Moscow was working on various options in response to the planned embargo. Sanctions were a double-edged sword for the Europeans and others, he said, as the cost for European citizens would increase every day. Oil prices rose by 5% on news of the EU plan to $110 a barrel of Brent Crude. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said in a video briefing on social media that the gradual EU ban on oil was ""better than nothing"". Any country that opposed the oil embargo was complicit in Russia's crimes in Ukraine, he said, whatever their arguments. As well as seeking a ban on Russian oil, the EU Commission president announced that sanctions would be imposed on military officers involved in suspected war crimes in Bucha and Mariupol. ""This sends another important signal to all perpetrators of the Kremlin's war: We know who you are, and you will be held accountable,"" Ms von der Leyen told the European Parliament on Wednesday. There are plans for a broad ban on three of the biggest Russian state-run broadcasters. ""We have identified these TV channels as mouthpieces that amplify Putin's lies and propaganda aggressively,"" Ms von der Leyen said. Although the three networks were not named, they are thought to include the widely watched Russian-language Rossiya and RTR Planeta channels of state-owned operator VGTRK. The EU has already suspended two networks, RT and Sputnik, that broadcast in English, German and Spanish. A ban would also be imposed on providing European services to Russian companies through accountants, lawyers and spin-doctors, she said. Earlier sanctions have already hit Russian banks but the biggest bank of all, Sberbank, has been left off the list because it was considered necessary for paying for Russian gas. Sberbank makes up over a third of Russia's banking sector and is now set to be removed from the SWIFT global financial messaging system. Two other Russian banks are included in the proposals. Previous sanctions packages have also targeted a number of individuals linked to the Kremlin and the invasion, and the head of the Russian Orthodox Church, Patriarch Kirill, is said to be on the latest list. He has given his full support to the war, prompting Pope Francis to warn him not to become ""Putin's altar boy"". The Commission president also gave details of plans to help Ukraine tackle the vast costs of the war and the impact on its economy. Explaining Europe's ""very special responsibility towards Ukraine"", she said Ukraine needed to fund the dramatic fall in its economic output and wider reconstruction. A recovery package would be drawn up that could tackle weaknesses in the Ukrainian economy and help fight corruption, she said. ""We want Ukraine to win this war, but we also want to set the conditions for Ukraine's success in the aftermath of the war."" In a separate move, the EU also promised to increase military aid to neighbouring Moldova, which is under threat from Russian soldiers based in the breakaway Moldova region of Transnistria. ""We will continue to deepen our partnership with you to bring your country closer to the EU,"" European Council President Charles Michel told Moldova's pro-EU president, Maia Sandu, in Chisinau.

Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said the ban will cut off service exports ""critical to the Russian economy"". Ms Truss said the ban will ""help ensure Putin fails in Ukraine"". Other sanctions among the 63 introduced on Wednesday target Russian media organisations and those working for them. The government said UK accountancy, management consultancy and PR services account for 10% of Russian imports in these sectors. ""Doing business with Putin's regime is morally bankrupt and helps fund a war machine that is causing untold suffering across Ukraine,"" said Ms Truss. ""Cutting Russia's access to British services will put more pressure on the Kremlin and ultimately help ensure Putin fails in Ukraine."" Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng added: ""Our professional services exports are extraordinarily valuable to many countries, which is exactly why we're locking Russia out. ""By restricting Russia's access to our world-class management consultants, accountants and PR firms, we're ratcheting up economic pressure on the Kremlin to change course."" Legislation is now in force requiring social media and internet services to block content from Russian state-controlled media RT and Sputnik. Tech and Digital Economy Minister Chris Philp said: ""For too long RT and Sputnik have churned out dangerous nonsense dressed up as serious news to justify Putin's invasion of Ukraine. ""These outlets have already been booted off the airwaves in Britain and we've barred anyone from doing business with them. ""Now we've moved to pull the plug on their websites, social media accounts and apps to further stop the spread of their lies."" Ever since Russian forces invaded Ukraine, Britain has imposed unprecedented sanctions on Russia. Assets frozen, banks cut off, oil imports curbed, luxury goods exports banned, oligarchs targeted. So in that context, stopping British public relations executives having Russian clients might seem small beer. Many of the big accountancy firms have already reduced their business in Russia and farmed off local staff. And - if you look at the small print - these latest sanctions do not apply to the whole of the UK service sector. There is no mention of the lawyers and the estate agents and the rest which have, in the past, helped smooth the path of Russian money and influence into the UK. But UK officials insist more restrictions on the service sector are to come and similar curbs are also being agreed by the EU. In March RT disappeared from all broadcast platforms in the UK after UK access to the TV network was affected by a ban imposed by the European Union. Media regulator Ofcom also revoked its licence to broadcast in the UK. Media organisations facing sanctions include All Russia State Television and Radio Broadcasting. Other media companies sanctioned include news agency InfoRos, disinformation website SouthFront and the online journal Strategic Culture Foundation. War correspondents, including those embedded with Russian forces in Ukraine, are also on Wednesday's list. They include Evgeny Poddubny, a war correspondent for the All-Russia State Television and Radio Broadcasting Company; Alexander Kots, a war correspondent for Russian newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda; and Dmitry Steshin, a Russian journalist and special correspondent for Komsomolskaya Pravda. Others sanctioned include those working for Channel One a major state-owned outlet in Russia, which described the invasion of Ukraine as a ""special military operation"". The UK has now sanctioned over 1,600 individuals and entities since the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The latest sanctions come as Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said it was ""inconceivable"" that the UK would not help Finland or Sweden if they were attacked by Russia, even if they had not joined Nato. The two countries are expected to make a bid to join the alliance. Speaking on a visit to a military exercise in Finland, Mr Wallace said it was up to Finland to decide whether or not to join. ""I cannot conceive a time when we wouldn't come to support Finland and Sweden no matter where they were with the Nato debate or where they are with agreements,"" he said. "

Dozens of tanks will be deployed to countries ranging from Finland to North Macedonia this summer. Joining them will be tens of thousands of troops from Nato, and the Joint Expeditionary Force, which includes Finland and Sweden.

The men, some with a reported history of violence, message the women on Facebook groups specially set up to connect sponsors and hosts. Some refugees have also become homeless after relations with hosts broke down or because housing was not well vetted. But a UK government official said safeguards were in place. These included ""Home Office security and background checks on all sponsors, before visas are issued"", and at least one council visit to a sponsor's property. A charity head labelled the Homes for Ukraine scheme dangerous and said she was ""shocked by the absence of safeguarding checks"". In March, the government announced the scheme would allow anyone to host a family or individual, if they agreed to housing, criminal-records and other background checks. The system is slightly different in Wales and Scotland. Numerous Facebook groups were set up by local support networks and individuals, in response. They have become one of the main ways of connecting families and sponsors. Last month the UN's refugee agency, the UNHCR, raised concerns about the system, highlighting what it called ""the need for adequate safeguards and vetting measures to be in place against exploitation"". In EU countries, accommodation is organised primarily by national authorities and charities. There are also some private arrangements. While some British charities have tried to match applicants with potential hosts, many refugees are using the informal Facebook groups. There is evidence predatory males are joining these groups. One whistleblower with knowledge of the official scheme told the BBC in some local authorities, as many as 30% of all registered would-be sponsors are single men over 40 - the majority of them offering to host single women in their 20s and 30s. The government says it does not recognise those figures. The BBC findings were ""deeply concerning and undermine the sponsorship programme"", said Robina Qureshi, chief executive of Positive Action in Housing. She described the scheme as ""dangerous"". Her organisation would never place a woman with a single man, and the government, she said, ""has created chaos, no risk checks, no due diligence"". On a Facebook group set up to help match Ukrainian refugees, BBC News found one would-be sponsor who appears to live in a one-bedroom flat posting multiple offers to host young women. Someone who knew him well claimed he had multiple convictions, including for burglary and affray. Police records indicate he was reported for allegedly carrying a crossbow and threatening a former partner, although no further action is believed to have been taken. Another man, in Manchester, had joined several Facebook groups and was offering a spare room to a string of young, single, Ukrainian women. He was also a member of a dating site called Single Ukrainian Women. Elsewhere on his timeline, he had written Islamophobic comments. It is not known whether either of these men was approved under the Homes for Ukraine scheme. Councils are meant to approve each property and complete Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) checks on all potential hosts they know about, including those who make contact via Facebook. But the basic DBS checks are limited. Enhanced checks are requested only if there are children involved. A basic DBS check had raised no concerns about a man in his 50s offering to host a young Ukrainian woman, a source told BBC News But when staff performed a more detailed check of social services records they found multiple complaints against him, including for domestic abuse and harassment. The UK government has come under pressure to speed up the settlement of refugees from Ukraine, with many complaining visa and host approvals have been unnecessarily slow. But it's thought that some councils are struggling with a lack of resources. The BBC found numerous posts on Facebook from Ukrainians who had reached the UK, but found their accommodation unsuitable. In such cases, often local charities step in to find emergency accommodation. One post from a volunteer helping new arrivals said: ""I was contacted by a young woman who had arrived on Saturday. She wanted to change hosts. I asked what the issue was and she sent me videos. The home wouldn't pass an inspection to rehome a dog."" The refugee involved, who does not want to be identified, told BBC News: ""She is a kind person but her house is a very big cluster of mess. There are many repairs needed. I couldn't go in the kitchen. I couldn't live here."" That refugee had received a visa under the Homes for Ukraine scheme, but the squalid condition of the property suggests no-one from the local council appeared to have checked the host's accommodation. She has since been rehoused. BBC News also learned of a Ukrainian who said she had been shown pictures of the bedrooms she and her two young children would be using. But on arrival, her entire family had been expected to sleep in one small reception room next to the kitchen, with no privacy. The property had not been inspected. There had been no DBS checks. And she says the house was filled with Nazi memorabilia. ""The family... have Nazi pictures and Soviet symbols,"" she said. ""I don't feel safe."" She left and found a better host through social media but feels deeply scarred by the experience. ""I do not want my children to feel unsafe again and we feel unsafe,"" she said. ""I think we will go back to Germany."" While offering to support a refugee in her own home, Mira Kozlowska, who is Polish but lived in the UK for 21 years, has found herself helping to match others with suitable sponsors on social media. ""So many people are arriving and wanting to change sponsor,"" she told BBC News. ""It's a huge problem on the horizon."" ""Just now, I saw a post about how the sponsor wants the family to be out all day and not in the house. ""Another girl was talking about how she didn't even have a door on her room and no privacy."" Another newly arrived refugee said, through an interpreter: ""When we arrive, there is no bed, just a mattress on the floor. ""The apartment is cold and when I put on the heater he shouts. ""There is no food in the kitchen and we have no money."" Under the Homes For Ukraine scheme, hosts receive £350 per month from the government. And Ms Kozlowska said: ""I'm basically wondering how many people are doing it solely for the extra £350 - very scary."" The government rejects those criticisms and said ""attempts to exploit vulnerable people [were] despicable"". ""The Homes for Ukraine scheme has safeguards in place, including Home Office security and background checks on all sponsors before visas are issued. Councils also conduct checks and must make at least one in-person visit to a sponsor's property."" Have you been affected by the issues raised in this story? Email haveyoursay@bbc.co.uk.

Thomas, 12, a pupil at Durham Trinity School and Sports College popped a handwritten letter into a convoy of supplies collected by his classmates. Addressing it to ""the best president"" Thomas told Volodymyr Zelensky he was ""happy to be helping"" Ukraine. Despite not expecting a reply, his school received one last week, saying the letter ""brings a smile to my face"". The reply is typed and written in English, dated Saturday 23 April and signed Volodymyr Zelensky. Teacher Robin Hadden said: ""We couldn't believe it when the letter arrived, our office staff opened it, addressed to 'Thomas at Trinity School', and asked around the classrooms as we were not expecting anything back. ""It's a really personal reply thanking Thomas for his thoughts, saying he is hoping to bring peace to all the citizens of Ukraine and how they'll rebuild towns and how hearing of the UK support has put a smile on his face."" The letter was among 270 parcels of medical supplies, clothing, food, toiletries and four wheelchairs donated by pupils from the special school, which helps youngsters with a wide range of additional learning needs. The convoy was driven in a cattle truck to a refugee reception centre last month, which was set up at the East Warsaw railway station in Poland to help Ukrainians fleeing the conflict. Among the items sent were cuddly toys collected by his class, which Thomas wrote in his letter were ""some teddies for your country along with some food as well"". The youngster also added he was hopeful Ukraine would ""win to beat Russia"" and that ""Putin is too scared about telling the truth about the war"". Thomas' mother Kimberley told BBC Radio Newcastle her son was excited when he arrived home after school on Friday.

It comes after the EU and its allies suspended seven institutions from the system in March. The move aims to hit the country's banking network and its access to funds via Swift, which is pivotal for the smooth transaction of money worldwide. Swift is the global financial artery that allows the smooth and rapid transfer of money across borders. It stands for Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication. Created in 1973 and based in Belgium, Swift links 11,000 banks and institutions in more than 200 countries. But Swift is not your traditional High Street bank. It is a sort of instant messaging system that informs users when payments have been sent and arrived. It sends more than 40 million messages a day, as trillions of dollars change hands between companies and governments. More than 1% of those messages were thought to involve Russian payments. In March, seven Russian banks were removed from Swift including Bank Otkritie, Novikombank, Promsvyazbank, Bank Rossiya, Sovcombank, Vnesheconombank (VEB) and VTB Bank. The European Commission now wants to exclude a further three including the country's biggest lender, Sberbank, which accounts for more than a third of Russia's banking sector. The package still has to be approved by EU ambassadors and is set to be signed off in the next few days. The EU, US, UK and others have said that cutting banks out of Swift will ensure they ""are disconnected from the international financial system and harm their ability to operate globally"". The aim is for Russian companies to lose access to the normal smooth and instant transactions provided by Swift, disrupting payments for its valuable energy and agricultural exports. Banks now have to deal directly with one another, adding delays and extra costs, and ultimately cutting off revenues for the Russian government. Russia was threatened with a Swift expulsion before - in 2014 when it annexed Crimea. Russia said the move would be tantamount to a declaration of war. Western allies did not go ahead, but the threat did prompt Russia to develop its own, very fledgling, cross-border transfer system called the System for Transfer of Financial Messages (SPFS) as an alternative to Swift. Few foreign countries currently use SPFS, but India is reportedly considering a Russian proposal to use it for payments in roubles. Separately, Moscow is working with Beijing to connect to China's Cross-Border Interbank Payment System (CIPS) - another alternative to Swift which processes payments in Chinese yuan. Some nations - such as Germany, France and Italy - were initially reluctant to take action against Russia's use of Swift. There were concerns that companies owed money by Russia would have to find alternative ways to get paid. There were also fears it could impact the global banking system, although there is no evidence of this yet. Alexei Kudrin, Russia's former finance minister, has suggested being cut off from Swift could shrink Russia's economy by 5%. However, there are doubts about the lasting impact on Russia's economy, particularly if banks find sustainable ways to reroute payments via countries that have not imposed sanctions. Swift was created by American and European banks, which did not want a single institution developing their own system and having a monopoly. The network is now jointly-owned by more than 2,000 banks and financial institutions. It is overseen by the National Bank of Belgium, in partnership with major central banks around the world - including the US Federal Reserve and the Bank of England. Swift helps make secure international trade possible for its members, and is not supposed to take sides in disputes. However, Iran was banned from Swift in 2012, as part of sanctions over its nuclear programme. It lost almost half of its oil export revenues and 30% of foreign trade. Swift says it has no influence over sanctions and any decision to impose them rests with governments. "
392,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-61318690,2022-05-04T11:46:55,Ukraine war: How Germany is getting rid of Russian oil," The pipeline that carries Russian oil to Germany is called Friendship, or Druzhba in Russian. But Vladimir Putin's attack on Ukraine has destroyed any lingering feelings of affection. Druzhba opened in the 1960s, transporting oil more than 5,000km (3,100 miles) from what was then the Soviet Union to Schwedt in former communist East Germany. The refinery in Schwedt is key to the European Union's plan to phase out Russian oil imports by the end of 2022, a proposal that has won Germany's support. Since the invasion the German government has dramatically reduced its dependence on Russian oil from 35% to 12%, all of which comes to the refinery in Schwedt. But people here are worried what an embargo might mean for German regions like this, where thousands of livelihoods depend on Russian energy. ""We are very worried and very shocked,"" says Schwedt's mayor, Annekathrin Hoppe, who once worked in the refinery herself. She fears closing the site could destroy the local economy, although at the same time she says the town stands behind Ukraine and understands the urgency of moving away from Russian energy. After the fall of the Berlin Wall, and the sudden withdrawal of East German state support for local industries, this region went into decline and during the 1990s struggled with unemployment and depopulation. Thanks to the refinery it has managed to get back on its feet. Schwedt today is thriving with newly renovated buildings and spotless streets. Russian oil was more than just a symbol of friendship. The oil refinery in Schwedt became the region's economic heart. More than 1,000 people work at the refinery, and another 2,000 at companies nearby that depend on it. The refinery heats most of the homes in Schwedt and provides fuel for more than 90% of vehicles in north-eastern Germany, including Berlin. Mayor Hoppe says closing the refinery would prompt a collapse in fuel supplies in this region and parts of Poland, impacting drivers, emergency services and even Berlin airport. That is why German Economy Minister Robert Habeck has spent the past few months on a whirlwind global tour, from Norway to Qatar, to find alternatives to Russian energy. Last week, after a visit to Poland, he explained in a social media video how Germany had managed to pivot away from Russian oil quicker than expected, and that it could now survive an oil energy embargo. Mr Habeck pulled no punches, saying prices would go up and sacrifices would have to be made, but he stressed an embargo would no longer lead to economic collapse. This video acted as a green light to other European capitals, as it meant Berlin would now support a ban on Russian oil. The German government hopes to find other sources of oil for the Schwedt refinery but there is one problem: it is majority-owned by Russian state oil company Rosneft. That's why this is the only site in Germany still dependent on Russian oil. The government has a solution, to ship oil in via German and Polish ports, but it says this is not possible as long as Rosneft has control. Berlin is now looking at a new law that could allow the German state to take over energy facilities considered crucial to national security. ""I know what war means,"" restaurant owner Ismail Sakiri told me on his terrace overlooking the Oder river. The scene here is idyllic, but with Poland on the other side of the river, the war in Ukraine feels close. He grew up in former Yugoslavia and has his own painful experience of conflict. Like most people in Schwedt he fully supports Ukraine and helps Ukrainian refugees coming over the border, he says. But he also wants his town to survive and believes without the refinery businesses like his would go under. Germany's approach to Russian energy has proved hard to explain to some of its EU partners. It is unpopular with some German voters who want an overnight ban. But the government has never shifted from its stance that Germany's economy would not survive an immediate embargo. Instead Berlin is trying to diversify as quickly as possible, and stop Russian imports as soon as the economic hit is manageable. This appears to be working with coal, and now oil as well. The next challenge for Germany is to wean itself off Russian gas. "

Many have joined friends and family, but others are staying in the houses of people they met through the Homes for Ukraine scheme. In Buckden in Cambridgeshire, a weekly event have been set up for 50 refugees who are now living in and around the village where families can meet, share a meal and get support. What are the residents and businesses doing to help refugees feel part of the community, and what do Ukrainians make of it? Jason Negus has owned the butchers in Buckden, which has about 3,000 residents, for 11 years. He says last week he donated ""pork-based products, like pork chops and pork belly slices"" for the weekly meal, while this week it will be chicken. ""It's a collaboration between lots of different businesses who are donating to make this meal happen,"" he says. The butcher says he wanted to help because ""you're seeing all of those people, they're out of their homes and they've lost their loved ones"". ""Let's pull together and make it work for them,"" he says. ""I hope it takes the pressure off them and I hope it brings people together in this country as one."" Marcin Laskowski runs an artisan bakery in nearby Huntingdon which specialises in east European and German products. He says he wants to help ""because it's a very difficult time; [the invasion] was a shock; we've got plenty of Ukrainian friends so we want to try and help a little bit"". The bakery had previously sent 90 pallets of products to Poland for Ukrainian refugees and now they are providing doughnuts and pastries for the weekly meal. Mr Laskowski says that includes traditional Ukrainian poppy seed pastries and dumplings. The baker, who is originally from Poland, says: ""Nobody thinks about war in 2022; it's very difficult for everyone."" He hopes the pastries allow the refugees to ""remember some tastes from their country and just for a few minutes forget about the situation"" there. Alex Hucklesby has been hosting a family of three in his home in Godmanchester for three weeks now. ""It has been hectic since they arrived, in terms of integrating more people into our already busy household, but also all the paperwork and bureaucracy that we've had to go through to get them what they need in the UK,"" he says. He adds that getting the visa was ""quite a challenge"" and they have also had to apply for universal credit, doctors, dentists, a midwife and make school applications for the refugees. ""As soon as we heard about the conflict in Ukraine we decided we want to do something, and as soon as the government launched the Homes for Ukraine scheme my wife and I decided we wanted to welcome a family into our home,"" he says. ""We discussed it with our children and they agreed to share rooms to free up space in the house and we took it from there."" He says the weekly meal is ""fantastic for [the refugee family] to meet other Ukrainians in Huntingdonshire"". ""People have been so welcoming and so helpful with donations of food and assistance, it's been incredible how the community has pulled together,"" he says. Nataliya Rudyk is staying with the Hucklesbys, along with her 12-year-old daughter and 7-year-old son. The 37-year-old was a human rights lawyer in Ukraine and also taught students with special needs. She says after Russian rocket strikes near her home in the south-west of the country, it was ""very dangerous for me and my family, I understood I needed to go to another country"". ""I am pregnant and my husband said go to the UK,"" she says. The mother-of-two says: ""Now I have two very good friends, my sponsors Alex and [his wife] Maria, I am happy I live in his house, his family is very friendly, he helps me every day."" She says the weekly meal is ""amazing for Ukrainian people"". ""It's very important for us because we can speak in Ukrainian and talk about our problems, talk about our decisions, like schools,"" she says.

Among them were 69 people who had sheltered in bunkers beneath the massive Azovstal steelworks for months. It's the first time a humanitarian corridor has been successfully agreed to enable some people to leave the plant. There were hugs and tears of exhaustion and relief as the group of women and children arrived. ""We were losing hope that we would ever get out,"" one woman told the BBC.

His house was just as he might have left it to walk to the shops. Maria filed a police report via an automated service online and settled in to wait. All Maria knows is that her father Mykola Medvid, a 56-year-old part-time car mechanic, left his house on 18 or 19 of March and hasn't been to see her baby since. ""We went to the nearby villages and the ones further away,"" Maria said. ""He wasn't at a friend's house, at a checkpoint. Not dead, not alive. It's like he disappeared into thin air.""

The two celebrated their wedding - complete with a cake baked by volunteers - in the hospital's surgical ward, enjoying a dance which has since been shared across the world: According to the The Lviv Medical Association, which shared the video on their Facebook page, the couple are hoping to travel to Germany for Oksana to have further treatment. from Sophie Williams & Olga Pona in Lviv One of the biggest musical groups in Ukraine has teamed up with Ed Sheeran, releasing a new song partly filmed and recorded while they were serving in the war against Russia.

Mr Putin was speaking in his first telephone talks in more than a month with French President Emmanuel Macron.  The French leader again called for a ceasefire and for talks to end the war brought on by Russia's invasion. He asked Mr Putin to allow further evacuations in the city of Mariupol. The city has seen some of the bitterest fighting of the war and hundreds of civilians are believed to remain trapped under the rubble of a steelworks held by Ukrainian forces. Western states have armed Ukraine extensively in its fight against Russia, and on Tuesday the UK announced a further pledge of military equipment worth £300m ($376m) including electronic warfare equipment, a radar system, GPS jammers and night-vision devices. Thousands of people, both combatants and civilians, have been killed or injured since the invasion on 24 February and more than 5.5 million have fled abroad as refugees. Russian forces have pulled back from the region of the capital Kyiv to focus their operations on eastern Ukraine. Calling for a stop to arms supplies, Mr Putin accused Ukrainian forces of committing war crimes by bombarding towns in eastern Ukraine where Moscow-backed separatists control large areas, according to a Kremlin statement. A number of attacks on residential areas have been recorded in separatist-controlled areas since the invasion began but nothing on the scale of the shelling of government-held towns by Russian forces. Ukraine denies shelling residential areas. Russian forces have been accused of carrying out atrocities, including in Bucha, a town outside Kyiv. The Russian leader insisted Russia was open to dialogue with Ukraine. According to a statement by the Élysée Palace, Mr Macron called on Mr Putin to put an end to Russia's ""war of aggression"" and said he was ready to help achieve a negotiated solution to the conflict which respected Ukraine's sovereignty. The French president, who won re-election last month, has spoken to Mr Putin several times since Russia's invasion of Ukraine. He said he was available to work with ""competent international organisations"" to help lift Russia's blockade of Ukraine's Black Sea ports so that it could resume food exports. "

Speaking to the BBC after returning to Kyiv, Melinda Simmons said she understood that Ukraine's defence is based on values that many Brits share. The Foreign Office advises against all travel to Ukraine because of the lethal danger posed by the Russian invasion. Since it began, one British national has been killed and four captured while fighting or providing aid there. ""Our travel advice is very clear,"" the British ambassador said to BBC Radio 4's World at One programme. ""Ukraine is not a safe place to be. It advises against all travel."" Asked why she is not more critical of people who make the choice to fight in Ukraine, Ms Simmons said: ""I think it quite hard to be critical of people who make choices to do this."" She described Ukraine's defence against Russia as an ""existential fight"" based upon shared principles that many in the UK hold dear. ""Some people interpret that as wanting to come and fight or come to a dangerous area to help deliver humanitarian aid,"" she said, ""I'd rather they didn't because it is not a safe country"". The British nationals captured by Russian forces include two aid workers who were detained at gun point in southern Ukraine last week. One of those workers, Paul Urey, has since appeared on Russian television to explain his decision to come to Ukraine while wearing handcuffs. It is not clear whether he was speaking under duress. After watching the video his mother Linda Urey said she didn't believe what he was saying: ""I know my son like every mother, and this is not him being natural."" A further two British men, Aiden Aslin, 28, and Shaun Pinner, 48, are being held by Russian forces after being captured while defending Mariupol. And last week the Foreign Office announced that a UK national had been killed in the conflict. It says the Russian invasion of Ukraine poses a ""real risk to life"" and advises against all travel there for any reason. Those wanting to help should instead consider donating or taking in a Ukrainian refugee, the Foreign Office guidance suggests. After leaving the Ukrainian capital in late February, the British ambassador Melinda Simmons said her return to her home on Friday was ""incredibly emotional."" Driving back into the capital Ms Simmons passed by ""bombed out playgrounds, bombed out schools, hospitals, burned out trees, twisted metal in farmland,"" she told broadcasters. It showed that the Russian military was deliberately targeting civilian sites, she said. ""Right from the beginning this was about hitting the Ukrainian nation. It wasn't just about taking out the military capability."" Ms Simmons has urged other foreign ambassadors to also come back to the capital. ""It's massively important for the work,"" she says, as well as being a psychological boost for the Ukrainians she works with. The French, Italian, and Spanish ambassadors are among those also to have already returned to the capital, and yesterday the United States said it hoped its embassy in Kyiv would resume operations by the end of May. The Ukrainian capital is still vulnerable to Russian air strikes, and last week Moscow made threats against Western diplomats returning to the city. Russian forces were primed to carry out strikes against ""decision-making centres in Kyiv,"" Moscow officials said, adding that the presence of foreign advisers in those sites ""will not necessarily be a problem to Russia deciding to take retaliatory action"". When asked by if Ukraine can ultimately win this war, Ms Simmons said the country had been underestimated. ""They have all the determination that is needed and all the focus that is needed to do this,"" she said. ""The challenge for them is to see this through."" "
401,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-61313296,2022-05-03T16:53:44,Russia beats final deadline to avoid debt default," Russia has avoided defaulting on its government debts by making necessary payments in US dollars, shortly before the final deadline passed on 4 March. $650m (£520m) payments on international bonds were originally due on 4 April. The US Treasury blocked Russia from making the payments from reserves frozen by Western sanctions, raising the prospect of default. Russia offered to pay in roubles then changed its policy last week. The decision marks the latest twist of a long-running wrangle with the US Treasury over how Russia is allowed to service its debts. If Russia had only made the payments in roubles, it would have deemed a failure to pay - a default - after a grace period of 30 days from the original payment date of 4 April. But on 29 April, it announced that it would change course and pay from the portion of its dollar reserves which were not kept in the West, and had thus escaped sanctions. A US official confirmed that the payments have been made. ""Russia was forced to choose between draining their remaining valuable dollar reserves or new revenue coming in, or default,"" the US official said. ""Russia has made their debt payment using funds located outside the US or other partner jurisdictions. These valuable reserves have permanently left Russia and can longer go towards funding their invasion of Ukraine,"" the official continued. The payments have arrived in some investors' accounts, according to unnamed sources quoted by the Reuters news agency. The Credit Derivatives Determination Committee for Europe, Middle East and Africa met on Tuesday to discuss whether Russia had failed to pay its debts, and therefore investors who had bought Credit Default Swaps, a form of insurance against non-payment, could start making claims. In a statement on its website, it noted news reports that payments had been made, and said it would defer the next step of the process, while it ""continues to monitor the situation."" A default may not have been permanently averted. Russia has around $40bn of international bonds still outstanding, and may have trouble making debt payments after 25 May, when US Treasury provisions allowing debt interest and repayments expire. A default would have been the first time Russia had failed to pay its government debt since 1998 - the economic crisis at the end of then President Yeltsin's term in office. A government default would be a major blow to Russian prestige - and Russia is clearly prepared to spend valuable foreign currency reserves to avoid it. The credit reference agencies, which would normally pass the definitive ruling on when a country has defaulted, are banned from covering Russian debts by EU sanctions. "

Addressing the Ukrainian parliament via video link, he said Ukraine's allies ""cannot make the same mistake"" as they did over the 2014 Crimea invasion. He said the West had been ""too slow to grasp what was really happening"" and ""failed"" to collectively impose sanctions against Vladimir Putin. Details of £300m of extra military aid were also announced by Mr Johnson. The military aid to be sent to Ukraine in the coming weeks will include electronic warfare equipment, a counter-battery radar system, GPS jammers and night-vision devices. Introduced to MPs in Kyiv by the Ukrainian parliament's speaker, Mr Johnson said Ukraine's allies must be ""humble"" as the nation was previously invaded in 2014 when Russia seized Crimea, and began the war in Donbas. ""We cannot make the same mistake again,"" he said. The UK prime minister - the first international leader to address the parliament since the Russian invasion - praised Ukraine's resistance for standing up to Russian forces. He said: ""You have exploded the myth of Putin's invincibility and you have written one of the most glorious chapters in military history and in the life of your country. ""The so-called irresistible force of Putin's war machine has broken on the immoveable object of Ukrainian patriotism and love of country."" He also echoed the words of Prime Minister Winston Churchill, just as Ukraine's President Volodomyr Zelensky did when he addressed MPs at Westminster in March. Speaking to Ukrainian MPs in the chamber holding Ukrainian and Union flags, he said: ""This is Ukraine's finest hour, that will be remembered and recounted for generations to come. ""Your children and grandchildren will say that Ukrainians taught the world that the brute force of an aggressor counts for nothing against the moral force of a people determined to be free."" Following the speech - which was delivered through an interpreter - the MPs in the Chamber stood to applaud and then President Zelensky described the UK and Ukraine as now being like ""brothers"". ""It is not scary when such an evil enemy is against you if such a good friend is next to you. Such as Great Britain"" the Ukrainian president said. He also thanked more than a dozen British celebrities who had voiced their support for Ukraine - including Sir Elton John, Ed Sheeran and the Beckham family. In an earlier interview with ITV's Good Morning Britain, Mr Johnson said the UK was leading the world in helping Ukraine to ""protect themselves"". He said: ""What the UK is doing - and has done since the crisis began - is lead the world in helping the Ukrainians protect themselves against barbaric aggression by Vladimir Putin. That's all we're doing. ""We're not saying we're doing this in order to drive some geopolitical change or to have an outcome in Moscow... ""What we care about is Ukrainian people and their suffering."" When asked about the Ukrainian UK ambassador's call for MPs to drop visa rules for refugees fleeing the country, the prime minister insisted it was important to ""protect the system from those who might want to abuse it"". A total of 86,000 visas have been issued, but only 27,000 refugees have arrived, Mr Johnson said. He said the UK could have reacted faster. The latest tranche of military support includes radar systems designed to detect artillery projectiles and missiles and then locate the positions of the weapons that fired them. The UK is also supplying heavy lift aerial drones, which can carry supplies to Ukrainian forces that have become isolated. And Downing Street said it would send 13 specialised Toyota Land Cruisers to protect civilians officials to command posts and help security authorities rebuild railways in eastern Ukraine, where Russian forces are now concentrated. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said the steel-plated vehicles, which were requested by the Ukrainian government, would also help evacuate civilians fleeing Russian shelling on the front line. They will arrive there in the coming days, she said. Ministers said last week that they would soon be able to supply Ukraine with long-range Brimstone missiles, as well as sending Stormer armoured vehicles to support the country's air defence. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the party supported sending military aid to Ukraine, but he called for the government to do more on sanctions and to process refugees ""much more quickly"". ""I think the in-principle position of all political parties that we stand up for Ukraine, stand with Ukraine, stand against Russian aggression is very important,"" he said. Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokeswoman Layla Moran said it was the right decision but ""wrong timing"" to send additional weapons to Ukraine, saying it was desperately needed a week ago. She questioned whether the prime minister had delayed the announcement ahead of local elections, a move she said was ""deeply cynical"". "

Groups representing Britons hoping to host Ukrainians plan to take the first step towards a class action case - and have employed a leading barrister. Latest figures show that of the 86,100 people given Ukraine scheme visas, 27,100 have so far arrived in the UK. The government said it had simplified the process and boosted staffing numbers for the scheme. A spokesperson added it was ""now processing visas as quickly as they come in - enabling thousands more Ukrainians to come through our uncapped routes"". More than 5.5 million people have fled Ukraine since Russia's invasion began on 24 February, according to the UN's refugee agency. The groups Vigil for Visas and Taking Action Over the Homes for Ukraine Visa Delays said they had instructed Amanda Jones, an immigration and public law barrister, to explore a potential legal challenge against the Home Office. Less than half of the people issued with visas under the Ukraine Family Scheme - which allows Ukrainians to join relatives already in the UK - have arrived, according to the latest Home Office figures. The groups said that, ""in many cases, people have either heard nothing or been informed that some family members have received visas whilst others remain 'under consideration'"". Katherine Klinger, from Vigil for Visas, has applied for a family of eight Ukrainians to stay with her in North London. Mrs Klinger told the BBC that the process has ""just been a fiasco"" and her experience urged her to take action. ""This will be a complicated action because it is challenging not only individual cases but the whole policy background, actions and inactions of the Home Office."" ""We have been advised to take a sample of 10 but we could have up to 1000, or more. We've been advised to submit 10 case studies - and issue that as the pre-action protocol."" ""If the Home Office does not get a grip on this urgent and potentially catastrophic situation, we will bring our action for judicial review and ask that it is considered urgently in light of the vulnerability of so many of the March Applicants."" A couple who will be part of the action are Mo Gibson and Nichola Merrick - who both worked in a Citizens Advice bureau in Hastings, East Sussex, for 10 years. ""My wife and I have got decades of experience as a paid Citizens Advice managers,"" Mr Gibson said. ""We've dealt with some horrific, really difficult challenging cases at every level, dealing with all sorts of dark sides of humanity. But never have we been absolutely stumped by something like this in trying to help. ""It's destroying our morale, but it could easily put these people, and it has put them, in more danger."" Charities helping refugees in Ukraine and its neighbouring countries believe there is a gap between public sentiment towards helping those fleeing the war and the UK government's response so far. An Ipsos opinion poll of over 1,000 UK adults found 51% think the government is offering too little humanitarian support to Ukraine. Enver Solomon, CEO of the Refugee Council, said he wanted to see the UK follow its ""European neighbours by doing much more for people who have literally lost everything"". ""We need a different approach that is humane, fair and effective which ensures people who have lost everything are quickly given the protection and safety they desperately need in the UK,"" he added. A government spokesperson said: ""In response to Putin's barbaric invasion we launched one of the fastest and biggest visa schemes in UK history. Over 86,000 visas have been issued so Ukrainians can live and work in the UK. ""The changes the Home Office has made to streamline the visa system, including simplifying the forms and boosting staff numbers, are working and we are now processing visas as quickly as they come in - enabling thousands more Ukrainians to come through our uncapped routes.""

Antytila are one of the biggest musical acts in Ukraine but stopped working to join the military. Proceeds from the song, released on Monday, will go to help the people of Ukraine. ""Ed feels that pain, compassion and sympathy for Ukrainian people,"" lead singer Taras Topolya told the BBC. He said the lyrics were created while he was serving as a medic on the front line in Borodyanka. Borodyanka, just west of the capital, Kyiv, was occupied by the Russians, who left the town badly damaged. Ukrainian troops have since regained the area. After writing the lyrics, members of the group were also able to film while on the frontline in Kharkiv. ""We just stopped in the middle of the road and were singing there in the middle of nowhere,"" he said. Antytila went viral earlier this year after they posted a video offering to perform via live link at a concert for Ukraine in Birmingham. Organisers of the concert, which featured Ed Sheeran, turned down the offer because of the group's association with the military. Topolya said that because of this, Sheeran's team then proposed a collaboration with the band. The video has since had over one million views on Youtube. ""It has already raised awareness about the situation in Ukraine and this process is continuing,"" Topolya said. ""I am very glad a famous singer supports Ukrainians.""

Harry Richardson, an English teacher, has returned to his home town Leek, Staffordshire, with his Ukrainian wife Alina and her daughter and grandson. The family had sheltered in a basement in Uman before escaping to Moldova. He will mentor students at JCB Academy after being offered a job by JCB chairman Lord Bamford who saw his story on BBC Midlands Today. Lord Bamford said people in Britain were following the plight of residents in Ukraine. ""I think British people are very moved by it and certainly I and my family as well feel [this]. I mean, it is so utterly shocking. ""These people are having their lives destroyed."" Mr Richardson, who moved to Ukraine three years ago, previously said his family put some belongings in a ""suitcase and two or three bags"" and left everything else behind. Their difficult journey to the border included being stopped 18 times at road blocks by soldiers and police, he said. Mr Richardson said he left behind people he had lived and worked with, with sadness but hoped to ""carry on drawing people's attention to the horror of what is being experienced"". He said teaching English at the JCB Academy ""brings a certain amount of normality back"". ""It reminds me of where I was in terms of my career, my aspirations. So it's really nice to get back to poetry and literature and not bombs and explosions,"" he said. Follow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

Sacred Heart Catholic Church, in Morriston, Swansea, has ties with a convent in Krakow which has housed refugees, including 30 children. Members had been raising funds, but felt they could do more and started to knit clothes for mothers and babies. Father Jason, the church's priest, has now delivered some items to Poland. Suzanne Romano, a member of the knitting group, said it was set up in response to the war after the United Nations Population Fund estimated there were 265,000 pregnant women in Ukraine at the time of Russia's invasion. She said: ""By knitting, we aim to provide blankets and clothes for the babies to give the mums peace of mind."" Elaine Rees, a fellow member of the knitting group, said the response she had seen for her appeal for help had been ""overwhelming"". Father Jason, who took the bundles of clothes to Krakow, said: ""We, as a church, have a long connection with the Sisters of our Lady of Mercy in Krakow, and Morriston has a long history with Ukraine. ""Many Ukrainians came here to live and work after the Second World War. ""We even had an Ukrainian club here."" After making the donation, he said: ""There is a sense of achievement that the parish of Morriston has helped in a little way and shown our concerns for the refugees."" But he added there was ""more to be done"". A building close to the convent in Krakow has been converted into a refuge for 60 people by the Catholic charity Caritas. Refuge manager Dominik Klos said: ""Most of them don't have anything. ""They fled with just small bags and a few things that they had time to pack. ""Mostly, the refugees are a little ashamed and don't want to ask for anything. ""They are grateful but they have a lot of needs. ""Every help is very important."" One of those refugees is Ohla, who fled to Poland from Kyiv with her mother and two children. ""We didn't bring much because we had only one bag between us all,"" she said. ""We only brought medicine and some clothes. In Caritas, they gave us clothes and food... because we brought nothing with us. ""We hope to go back, back to our home, when everything is finished."" More than 150,000 displaced Ukrainians have fled to Krakow, which has seen its population grow by about 20% since the start of the war. Szymon Czyszek, director of International Growth in Europe, with the Catholic charity Knights of Columbus, said integration and psychological help were crucial issues. He said: ""One of the things we need to work on is the teaching of the Polish language, but we also offer psychological aid. ""This is really important because we want to reach out to people and see not only from the perspective of material needs but also psychological needs. ""We also want to try to make sure they can get jobs here so that they can be integrated and become more independent."" "

Sergei Lavrov made the comments to try to justify Russia's portrayal of Ukraine as ""Nazi"" despite the fact that its president is Jewish. Israel's foreign ministry summoned Russia's ambassador for ""clarification"" and demanded an apology. Nazi Germany murdered six million Jews in the Holocaust in World War Two. Mr Lavrov made the remarks in an interview on Italian TV programme Zona Bianca on Sunday, days after Israel marked Holocaust Remembrance Day, one of the most solemn occasions in the Israeli calendar. When asked how Russia can claim that it is fighting to ""de-Nazify"" Ukraine when President Volodymyr Zelensky is himself Jewish, Mr Lavrov said: ""I could be wrong, but Hitler also had Jewish blood. [That Zelensky is Jewish] means absolutely nothing. Wise Jewish people say that the most ardent anti-Semites are usually Jews."" The minister's statement was met with outrage across Israel's political spectrum. Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett said: ""Such lies are meant to blame the Jews themselves for the most terrible crimes in history and thus free the oppressors of the Jews from their responsibility. ""No war today is the Holocaust or is like the Holocaust."" Israeli foreign minister Yair Lapid reacted angrily, calling Mr Lavrov's words ""unforgivable"". Mr Lavrov was also condemned by the head of Israel's Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial, Dani Dayan. ""Most of his remarks are absurd, delusional, dangerous and deserving of any condemnation,"" he tweeted. ""Lavrov deals with the reversal of the Holocaust: turning the victims into criminals, based on the promotion of a completely unfounded claim that Hitler was of Jewish descent."" In a video address, President Zelensky said: ""I have no words... No one has heard any denial or any justification from Moscow. All we have from there is silence"". The Ukrainian president added that the silence indicates the Russian leadership had either forgotten ""all the lessons of World War Two"" or ""perhaps they have never learned those lessons"". US State Department spokesman Ned Price said Mr Lavrov's comments showed ""the lowest form of racism"" and ""insidious lies"". He added that ""the Kremlin is consistently proving that there is no floor when it comes to just how low they can stoop"", and Mr Lavrov's claims are ""the latest example of that"". The BBC's Jon Donnison in Jerusalem says the strength of the reaction reflects just how deeply offensive and unconscionable Mr Lavrov's comments will be to Jews, both in Israel and around the world. Over recent months, Israel, which has a large Russian population, has tried at times to act as a mediator between Russia and Ukraine. But, he says, the Israeli government has faced some criticism for not taking a tough enough line with President Vladimir Putin. Mr Lavrov's comments will test Israel's relations with Russia and while offensive to many, they reflect a common narrative amongst the Kremlin's supporters, our correspondent adds. Ukraine's foreign minister rebuked Mr Lavrov, saying his remarks were evidence of Russia's own ""deep-rooted anti-Semitism"". There have for decades been unproven claims that Hitler's unidentified paternal grandfather was Jewish, fuelled by an assertion by Hitler's lawyer Hans Frank. In his memoir, published in 1953, Frank said he had been instructed by Hitler to investigate rumours that he had Jewish ancestry. Frank said he uncovered evidence that Hitler's grandfather was indeed Jewish - though the claim, which has gained ground among conspiracy theorists, has been treated with scepticism by mainstream historians.

The Azovstal plant was being shelled by ""all kinds of weapons"", National Guard commander Denys Shlega said on Monday. On Sunday a number of civilians who had sheltered inside the last resistance stronghold managed to escape. But ""several dozen small children are still in the bunkers underneath the plant"", the commander said. The shelling on the plant in the southern port city, which has been under intense Russian bombardment for weeks, began as soon as the civilians who had been evacuated left, he told Ukrainian television. On Monday evening, footage emerged apparently showing a massive fire at the Azovstal, in what social media users said was a result of Russian bombardment. A first group of evacuees from the steelworks were expected to arrive in the Ukrainian-controlled city of Zaporizhzhia on Monday - but the rescue efforts have run into delays, the BBC's Laura Bicker, who is in the city, reports. It is not clear what is causing the hold-up, she says. The convoy is on its way, but the buses have hundreds of miles to travel along a road which is - in part - rubble. They also have to go through a number of Russian checkpoints. Those who left Mariupol on Monday were evacuated with the support of the United Nations (UN) and the International Committee of the Red Cross, which organised an official convoy. Russia said some evacuees had been taken to a village controlled by Moscow-backed separatists. But state media later reported that they would be free to travel onwards to Ukrainian-held territory if they wanted to. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky welcomed the news that around 100 people were heading for Zaporizhzhia, which is about 140 miles (230km) north-west of Mariupol. ""Grateful to our team! Now they, together with UN, are working on the evacuation of other civilians from the plant,"" he wrote on Twitter. Some people have spent many weeks sheltering in the Azovstal steelworks, with reports suggesting food, water and medicine supplies are all running low. ""The situation has become a sign of a real humanitarian catastrophe,"" Ukraine's Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said. One Russian news report estimated the number of civilians still in the plant was more than 500. A few evacuees from Mariupol who had not been sheltering in the steelworks arrived in Zaporizhzhia earlier on Monday after travelling independently. ""We lived in [our] basement starting from 27 February,"" Natalya Tsyntomirska told Reuters news agency. ""The whole time, we were shelled with mines, and then air strikes started. Our house is completely destroyed."" Another evacuee, who did not give a name, said she had been unable to reach the evacuation buses because of a blockade. ""Our city is divided between the left bank and right bank. The left bank was under a total blockade. We couldn't reach these buses,"" she said. Late on Monday, the Mariupol city council said an evacuation of civilians with the support of the UN and Red Cross had been agreed for Tuesday at 07:00 local time (04:00 GMT). Russia has so far made no public comments on the issue. A number of similar evacuation attempts have failed in recent days - with both Ukraine and Russia blaming each other for reneging on the agreed terms. By Laura Bicker in Zaporizhzhia A few civilians with their own cars are making use of the humanitarian corridor brokered by the United Nations and the Red Cross to get to the refugee centre. Most of the vehicles are battered, one even had its windscreen smashed. Others are using plastic film and sticky tape to hold parts of the car together. Daniil had to scramble through the city looking for spare parts for his car after it was hit by shrapnel from a shell which landed just five metres away. Peeking out the plastic film window from the passenger seat was his husky dog, Sly. After handing over his papers to officials, Daniil jumped out the car and threw his hands in the air. His fingers made the V for victory sign. ""It's been difficult, tough, frightening. I lived on a tugboat in the port in Mariupol. We couldn't even raise our heads. It was so scary to be there,"" he said. ""Mariupol used to have a wonderful park. It was a prospering city. Now it's all gone."" I asked him what he will do now. ""I am going to leave. I am going to get as far from everything as possible."" Mariupol is almost fully under Russian control, with much of the city destroyed in weeks of heavy Russian bombardment and intense street fighting. Taking the port city is a key Russian war aim, and some of Russian troops there have already been released to join Moscow's wider offensive in the eastern Donbas region. However, Ukrainian soldiers have continued to defend the steelworks. Azovstal and its maze of of underground tunnels - surrounded by water on three sides - has become their fortress, plant director general Enver Tskitishvili told the BBC on Monday. It has 36 bunkers, some of them able to withstand a direct nuclear strike. The Ukrainian government had updated Azovstal's bunker system in the wake of Russia's annexation of the southern Crimea peninsula and Moscow's backing of rebels in Donbas in 2014. Earlier this year, it even gave Ukrainian fighters details and maps of the underground network, and supplied the plant with 40,000 packages of food - each one enough for one person for one day. ""But we didn't expect such a genocide and inhumane war,"" Mr Tskitishvili said. "

But they have yet to make it to Ukrainian-controlled areas. Azovstal is the last Ukrainian hold-out in Mariupol, a port city devastated by Russian shelling. The civilians - and armed defenders - have been sheltering in the complex of tunnels and bunkers of the steelworks since the rest of the city fell to Russian troops. Hundreds more remain trapped there - desperately short of food, water and other supplies. A Ukrainian National Guard commander at the plant, Denys Shlega, said Russian forces had resumed heavy shelling of the area. Russia has not admitted any shelling since President Vladimir Putin ordered a tight siege of the plant to force its defenders to surrender. EU remains divided over Russian energy European Union energy ministers have failed to reach agreement on how - and when - to wean their countries off Russian oil and gas. Some countries are more dependent on the imports and reluctant to commit to measures which would deprive their citizens. Germany's economic minister said the country would be able to weather a Russian oil ban by the end of 2022, as he appeared to back tougher sanctions. However, Hungary said it opposed such a move, stating it would not back measures that could endanger supplies. Russia cut gas supplies to Bulgaria and Poland last week after the two EU member states refused to pay Moscow in roubles, as President Putin demanded. EU payments to Russia amounting to millions of dollars a day are used to finance the invasion of Ukraine. President Volodymyr Zelensky has often described it as ""blood money"". Israel's foreign minister has denounced as ""unforgivable"" remarks by his Russian counterpart that Nazi leader Adolf Hitler ""had Jewish blood"". Russian FM Sergei Lavrov made the comments to try to justify Russia's portrayal of Ukraine as ""Nazi"" despite the fact that its president, Volodymyr Zelensky, is Jewish. Nazi Germany murdered six million Jews in the Holocaust in World War Two. Commenting on Mr Lavrov's remarks, Prime Minister Naftali Bennet said: ""Such lies are meant to blame the Jews themselves for the most terrible crimes in history and thus free the oppressors of the Jews from their responsibility. ""No war today is the Holocaust or is like the Holocaust."" from Andrew Harding, BBC News, Lysychansk Russian forces have been pushing towards Lysychansk from the north, the east, and now from the south-east, in what appears to be a more methodical and perhaps more effective strategy to cut off key Ukrainian supply lines, including the region's vital rail network. Most civilians have already abandoned Lysychansk, but during a particularly noisy burst of shelling, a family of four walked along the pavement near the hospital carrying fresh supplies of food to a nearby cellar. ""We have nowhere else to go. No relatives in other places. Besides, you need money to live somewhere else and we would be broke within a month,"" said Anastasia Leontiova, holding her four-year-old son's hand. Seventeen civilians, including several children, were living in the cellar of a large administrative building. Their water had just been cut, but they still had electricity. One couple, Lubova Gubin, 69, and her husband Alexei, 73, sat on their beds in a tiny room, listening to the news on a radio and quietly arguing about what they should do. ""We'll stay here. We've had a long life,"" said Alexei, firmly. ""Well, he decides,"" said Lubova. by Jayne Morgan, BBC Wales Investigates Yuliia and her three daughters used to run out of their basement shelter in Mariupol after rain.

418,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-61298791,2022-05-02T18:29:58,EU divided over how to step away from Russian energy," European Union countries are split on how soon they wind down dependence on Russian energy supplies. While sanctions have been applied to other areas of business, the EU remains heavily reliant on Russian oil and gas. Germany's economic minister said the country would be able to weather a Russian oil ban by the end of 2022, as he appeared to back tougher sanctions. However, Hungary has said it opposes such a move, stating it would not back measures that could endanger supplies. EU ministers met on Monday to discuss how to manage the situation, under intense pressure to reduce the revenue stream supporting President Vladimir Putin's war in Ukraine. There are two main challenges faced by members states - how to pay for Russian energy in a way which doesn't breach or undermine EU sanctions, and also how to source and develop alternative supplies to move away from reliance on Russia. At a press conference on Monday, the EU's energy policy chief Kadri Simson said Russia halting gas supplies to Poland and Bulgaria had strengthened the bloc's will to become independent of Russian fossil fuels. But according to the Centre of Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA), the EU has imported about £37bn worth of fossil fuels since the conflict began. The two largest importers worldwide were Germany followed by Italy. Energy giant Gazprom stopped gas exports to Poland and Bulgaria last week after those countries refused to comply with Russian demands to switch to payment in roubles, and many other member countries are set to face the same issue around mid-May. Poland and Bulgaria had planned to stop using Russian gas this year and say they can cope with the stoppage, but it has raised fears that other EU countries, including Europe's gas-reliant economic powerhouse Germany, could be next. Ms Simson repeated the European Commission's view on Monday that paying for gas in roubles would be a ""violation"" of sanctions and ""cannot be accepted."" She said member states were building up gas storage supplies before winter. Nathan Piper, head of oil and gas research at Investec, told the BBC it was ""pretty clear"" that the EU wanted to ""pivot away"" from Russian oil and gas, but added the lack of unity was being caused by the ""ability to actually make that happen"". Europe gets about 40% of its natural gas from Russia, which is also the bloc's main oil supplier, but some countries are more dependent Russian fossil fuels than others, so sudden supply cuts could have huge economic impact. For example, Germany currently gets about 25% of its oil and 40% of its gas from Russia, Slovakia and Hungary received 96% and 58% respectively of their oil imports from Russia last year, according to the International Energy Agency. Germany's economic minister Robert Habeck said his country had ""managed to reach a situation where Germany is able to bear an oil embargo"" and was ""on course to do the same for gas"". ""Other countries need a bit more time,"" he added. Diplomatic sources told the BBC that compromises to a complete bloc ban were being looked at, particularly for countries such as Hungary and Slovakia. Mr Piper said with oil, there were more options to get alternative supplies, compared to gas, which is transported most commonly through pipelines. He added it is also ""trickier"" for landlocked EU states to find new sources. He also warned while Germany might move to ban oil, switching off its Russian gas - which makes up 40% of its total imports - would ""take them years"". ""Russia could go 'if you want to go after our oil, how about we reduce our gas',"" he added. ""They could push up the price, reduce the volumes. They have a lot of bargaining power."" Elsewhere, energy research institute EWI said Germany should limit gas use now to prepare for the possibility of a future cut-off from Russia. Uniper, one of Germany's biggest energy firms, also warned an EU ban on Russian oil could prompt Russia to halt westward gas flows. The company said last week it would pay in euros which will be converted into roubles, meeting the Kremlin's demand for all transactions to be made in the Russian currency. ""We consider a payment conversion compliant with sanctions law and the Russian decree to be possible,"" a spokesman told the BBC. Other European energy firms are reportedly preparing to do the same amid concerns about supply cuts. In late March, Russia said ""unfriendly countries"" would have to start paying for its oil and gas in roubles to prop up its currency after Western allies froze billions of dollars it held in foreign currencies overseas. Under the decree, European importers must pay euros or dollars into an account at Gazprombank, the Swiss-based trading arm of Gazprom, and then convert this into roubles in a second account in Russia. The majority - 97% - of EU companies' gas supply contracts with Gazprom stipulate payment in euros or dollars. Some countries are looking to turn to liquified natural gas (LNG), with the US agreeing to ship an additional 15 billion cubic metres to Europe by the end of the year. The US has already banned Russian oil imports and the UK plans to phase them out by the end of the year. The EU has previously laid out a strategy to make it independent of Russian fossil fuels by 2030, which includes greater use of greener sources of power. "

Yuliia and her three daughters used to run out of their basement shelter in the besieged city of Mariupol after it'd rained as they were so thirsty. It wasn't just the basics of water and food, there was no toilet, shower or electricity in their refuge from bombs. Nataliia now wants her childhood friend with her in the sanctuary of Wales. ""We had a small bowl [of soup] for three kids once per day,"" explained Yuliia. ""And one glass of water for three kids to clean themselves."" After her home was destroyed by Russian bombs, Yuliia and her daughters - aged 11, six and three - had to find sanctuary in a communal basement which offered some shelter but she barely had any food to feed the children. ""The kids were asking for food so much, that's why she tried to feed them at bed time, so they felt full before bed,"" said worried friend Nataliia, watching on from her home in north Wales. ""When it started to rain first of all they were able to drink from the puddle and that water was so, so, tasty. Then they found some pans to fill with water.""

Yuliia and Nataliia, who moved from Ukraine to Wales to be with her husband Dewi five years ago, have been close friends since school and had always kept in touch - until war broke out in Ukraine in February. For days, sometimes weeks, it wasn't safe for Yuliia to text or call her friend 2,000 miles away. Nataliia had to make do with Yuliia's intermittent video diary updates from her underground bunker with her girls while her husband fought the Russians on the front line. The 32-year-old accountant has managed to get her mum and stepdad out of eastern Ukraine when the situation began to escalate and Liudmyla and Sasha now live with Nataliia, husband Dewi, four-year-old Julia and Jacob, one, in the safety of Caernarfon. Now Nataliia can't just look on as her friend struggles and is doing everything she can to help Yuliia and her young family become Ukrainian refugees in Wales. Yuliia and her girls are among 11 million Ukrainians forced to flee their homes before they eventually escaped Mariupol, under fire - weeks before the start of the United Nations-led evacuation from the strategically significant city. The port city of Mariupol, which has been encircled since the start of March, is now mostly under the control of Russian forces - although several hundred Ukrainian troops remain in the Azovstal metal works factory in the south of the city. Russian forces have blockaded the sprawling industrial complex and are continuing their aerial bombardment of it, but no attempt has been made yet to clear Ukrainian troops from a network of tunnels beneath the factory. Russia has been accused of war crimes for its intense shelling of the city, with the local mayor saying at least 20,000 civilians have been killed. More than 100,000 people remain trapped in the city. By train and then minibus, they headed for Poland, not knowing when they'd see her husband again, or whether they'd be able to join Nataliia and her family in Wales. But it is the sights of war that are leaving their mark on Yulia. ""She did see dead people in Mariupol, the ones who were killed by rockets who had no hands, no legs, whose bodies were destroyed,"" said Nataliia. ""I would love to have Yuliia here in Wales. I was dreaming that one day we will have a cup of tea in our dining room altogether and they can see our life here and have a more happy life. I just would love it."" About 27,000 Ukrainian refugees - out of the 86,000 approved visas - are in the UK and Wales has said it wants to be a ""nation of sanctuary"" for those fleeing the horrors of war in their home-land. About 10,000 Welsh households had offered homes to Ukrainian refugees but by the end of last month, the Home Office had issued 2,300 visas for those wanting to come to Wales. The Welsh government has sponsored nearly 700 visa applications so far, but couldn't tell BBC Wales Investigates how many refugees had arrived in Wales, insisting it has asked the UK government for the data but been told it's unavailable. The Home Office said it is working ""as fast as it can"" to provide the information for the devolved governments, adding more than 86,000 visas have been granted under various schemes and is simplifying forms and boosting staff numbers to speed up applications.

A brown smoke trail from a rocket drifted overhead, and three artillery shells landed perhaps a mile east of the road one recent afternoon, as Major Oleg Kravchenko drove at furious speed towards a forward medical post close to the advancing Russian front lines. ""Every day it's blood, blood, blood, blood,"" said Maj Kravchenko, a wry, burly figure who heads the army's medical teams in the area. ""Keep your head down and watch out for snipers. The Russians were shelling this area 15 minutes ago,"" an army nurse said as we followed the major into a derelict building where ambulance teams were waiting for the next call. The trill of springtime birdsong was interrupted every few seconds by the boom of artillery. Broken glass and debris covered the floor. An unused table-tennis table stood in one corner, near a large hole that had been torn in the concrete wall by an incoming shell. The medics sat nearby around a makeshift table, drinking coffee. Lysychansk is one of many strategic towns - set amid forests, rolling hills, and giant coal mines - now being targeted by the Kremlin as its forces try to organise a pincer movement from the east to seize the rest of the Donbas, and to encircle Ukrainian forces. ""The most we've had is 30 wounded (in one day). Shrapnel, bullets, trauma. Depending on what kind of battle. We pick them up and take them to the hospital. The fighting is very extreme and dangerous now. But our soldiers are holding our positions and we're giving to our enemy a good fight,"" Maj Kravchenko said. On many front lines, the overwhelming majority of injuries involve shrapnel and concussion - evidence of the Russian strategy of simply bombarding Ukraine's heavily-fortified positions from a distance. But the bullet injuries the major spoke about seem to back up reports that Russian troops are now seeking to advance on foot. Further up the hill, outside Lysychansk's crumbling, Soviet-era hospital, now run by the military, a soldier with severe head injuries lay on a stretcher inside an ambulance. ""The injury is severe. His prospects are very poor,"" said the medic treating him, gruffly, seconds before the ambulance left to move the patient to a safer location. Upstairs, the darkened hospital wards were packed with more young soldiers, many lying listlessly on beds, suffering from concussion. ""It was mortar fire. On Easter day. My head aches. It's hard to focus,"" whispered Olexander Grinchak, 30. He gestured slowly towards the bed opposite, where his friend was recovering from similar injuries. The hospital has no running water, but is continuing to perform surgery. On the streets outside, many buildings bear the scars of recent Russian artillery and rocket fire. A fresh impact site left a huge hole on the road; a petrol station had been shattered by another strike. Russian forces have been pushing towards Lysychansk from the north, the east, and now from the south-east, in what appears to be a more methodical and perhaps more effective strategy to cut off key Ukrainian supply lines, including the region's vital rail network. Most civilians have already abandoned Lysychansk and the nearby front-line town of Severodonetsk. But during a particularly noisy burst of shelling, a family of four walked along the pavement near the hospital carrying fresh supplies of food to a nearby cellar. ""We have nowhere else to go. No relatives in other places. Besides, you need money to live somewhere else and we would be broke within a month,"" said Anastasia Leontiova, holding her four-year-old son's hand. ""I'm feeling fine,"" said nine-year-old Masha, brightly, although she flinched when a loud explosion boomed across the town. ""I'm not scared. Because I'm the older sister, so I'm not scared,"" she continued. Seventeen civilians, including several children, were living in the cellar of a large administrative building. Their water had just been cut, but they still had electricity. One couple, Lubova Gubin, 69, and her husband Alexei, 73, sat on their beds in a tiny room, listening to the news on a radio and quietly arguing about what they should do. The retired kindergarten cleaner and truck driver have lived in Lysychansk their whole lives. ""We'll stay here. We've had a long life,"" said Alexei, firmly. ""Well, he decides,"" said Lubova. ""I told my wife she could leave with the children,"" replied Alexei. ""My husband is sick. His legs hurt. He can't walk. So, we'll stay. But I'm scared. This war should never have happened,"" said Lubova, before bursting into tears. ""It's awful. I'm so afraid. I'm afraid every night. I don't know if we'll survive this. I don't know if Lysychansk, or Ukraine, will survive."" "
423,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-61229607,2022-05-02T00:04:49,Ukraine war: A wake-up call for India - the world's biggest cooking oil importer," Indonesia, the world's biggest producer of palm oil, announced last week that it would halt exports to stabilise spiking prices at home, which it blamed on the war in Ukraine and the pandemic. Cooking oil is an integral part of the Indian diet. So much so that India is the world's second-largest consumer and largest importer of vegetable oils. Some 56% of its requirements are imported from more than seven countries. Indians mainly cook with palm, soybean and sunflower oils. For palm oil, the country imports 90% of its requirement from Indonesia and Malaysia. Nearly half of that comes from Indonesia alone. If this was not enough, half of India's sunflower oil requirements come from Russia and Ukraine, which account for 80% of global exports. The war in Ukraine is likely to lead to a 25% cut in supplies of sunflower oil in the next fiscal year, according to a report. Palm oil inventories in Malaysia, the second-largest producer, are also tight. This year, India will end up spending about $20bn (£16bn) in importing cooking oil, double of what it spent two years ago. ""No country can depend so much on imports. We are bleeding now. This is a big crisis. We need to learn from this war to reduce our dependence on imports,"" says BV Mehta, executive director of the Solvent Extractors Association, a vegetable oil trade organisation. India has cut tariffs on cooking oil to calm prices. But rising prices since 2020 and now the disruption in supplies due to the war in Ukraine have made things difficult. There has been a more than 300% rise in two years in global prices of palm oil - the cheapest oil preferred by Indian households, hotels, restaurants and bakeries. Not surprisingly, cooking oil prices have surged more than 20% in less than a month. There have been reports of people stocking up on supplies. Much of the country's fabled cheap street food is deep fried in oil. Along with rice, wheat and salt, cooking oil is a staple for the poorest Indians. ""The rise in cooking oil prices is definitely hurting,"" admits Sudhanshu Pandey, India's senior-most food official. It also easily fuels food inflation, which hit a 16-month-high of 7.68% in March. Di Yang, a food economist with UN Food and Agricultural Organisation (UNFAO), says that if prices continue to hover around such high levels, India might need to ration supplies as ""there is almost no alternative to compensate for import shortages in the short term"". To partially compensate for the shortages, India is pinning its hopes on a good crop of mustard and soybean this year. ""Our increased domestic production has meant that India has still not felt the full impact of global inflation as the domestic price rise in cooking oil has been almost half of the global rise in prices,"" says Mr Pandey. ""But in the end, we have to become self reliant and this will happen when farmers will switch to oil seeds when they fetch more attractive prices."" One plan is to grow more oil palm. On the face of it, the idea seems like a good one: it's a highly efficient crop - yielding several times more oil than similar crops like soybean. Palm oil is also highly versatile and can be used in consumer products and industrial applications. But palm is also a water guzzling crop, and new plantations will require slashing down of vast swathes of forests. The government has proposed that a third of the new oil palm plantations can come up in India's hilly-north east. This has predictably raised the hackles of the environmentalists who cite the examples of Indonesia and Malaysia whose success as major palm oil producers has come at the cost of their tropical rainforests. Mr Pandey says the government plans to treble India's domestic production of palm oil, currently a paltry 2.7%. For the moment, he says, Indians are moving to ""cheaper alternatives"" of cooking oil. Traditionally, Indians have cooked with aromatic and strongly flavoured oils like mustard, groundnut, coconut and sesame depending on which part of the country they lived in. The move to foreign vegetable and seed oils like palm and sunflower has possibly something to do with rising urbanisation and cosmopolitanism. These oils are also cheap and makers have sold them as healthier alternatives. ""Our cooking oil crisis is partly self-made because of lobbies which have successfully sold imported vegetable oils,"" says Pritha Sen, a food historian. Many believe that with more people moving into cities - and migrating within the country - a lot of urban cooking is done with colourless and odourless oils like palm and sunflower to make the food friendly for families and guests with different regional palettes. ""Bland and boring have come to define what many Indians cook and eat at home on a regular basis,"" says Marryam H Reshii, a food writer. ""And much of this has to do with the choice of cooking oil."" The rise in prices of these oils is now hurting Indians, who are already facing a cost-of-living squeeze. ""Vegetable oils are to Indian cooking what olive oil is to Mediterranean cuisine. The price hike will sharply impact our cooking practices,"" says Rakesh Raghunathan, a food show host. But then, who knows, this crisis could even nudge people to use cooking oil wisely, wonders Saadia Dhailey, a food writer. After all, a lot of Indians still like very oily food. "

Some have left the Azovstal steelworks, the last hold-out of Ukrainian troops in the strategically significant city. Russia said dozens of civilians have arrived in a village it controls. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said a large group is also on its way to Zaporizhzhia, which Ukraine maintains control of. ""The first group of about 100 people is already heading to the controlled area,"" he tweeted. ""Tomorrow [Monday} we'll meet them in Zaporizhzhia. Grateful to our team! Now they, together with UN, are working on the evacuation of other civilians from the plant."" The United Nations confirmed that a ""safe passage operation"" had begun to evacuate the citizens on Saturday, and that it was involved alongside the Red Cross. The evacuation convoy arrived on Saturday morning, the UN said - but did not give details on where people were being taken or how many had left, saying that sharing details could jeopardise the safety of the operation. Reuters footage from the complex show civilians - mainly women and children - being helped to walk over piles of rubble, and boarding a bus with missing windows. One woman with a six-month-old baby said they had been trapped in the steelworks for two months. Another, older woman says they were running out of food. Ukrainian officials said Russian shelling resumed on the steel plant after Sunday's brief ceasefire. While dozens have been rescued, several hundred civilians - including children - are still in the bunkers, Denys Shleha of Ukraine's National Guard was quoted by Reuters as saying on Sunday. He added that at least two more evacuation efforts like this will be needed to get everyone out. One of the evacuees to Russian-held territory told Reuters news agency: ""You just can't imagine what we have been through - the terror."" ""I feared that the bunker would not withstand it - I had terrible fear,"" 37-year-old Natalia Usmanova said. ""When the bunker started to shake, I was hysterical, my husband can vouch for that: I was so worried the bunker would cave in."" ""We didn't see the sun for so long."" In other developments: The first civilians managed to leave the Azovstal plant on Saturday, but their fate was unclear for most of the following day. Now, the Russian defence ministry says some 80 civilians have left the besieged steelworks and were taken to Bezimenne, a village in Russian-held territory in Ukraine. They are being provided with medical care and supplies, it said. In a statement carried by Russian media, the ministry also said that civilians who wanted to leave for Ukraine-controlled areas ""have been handed over to representatives of the UN and the International Committee of the Red Cross"". Reuters news agency reported that one of its photographers stationed in the village had seen more than 50 arrive in a convoy, and reported that UN staff were in the area. Mariupol has come under intense bombardment from Russian artillery for weeks. The Azovstal steelworks - where Ukraine's last defenders are holed up with some remaining civilians - is a vast industrial area with a network of underground tunnels, making its capture difficult for Russian forces. Last month, after declaring that the southern Ukrainian city had been captured, Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered his troops to seal off the steelworks ""so that a fly cannot not pass through."" The devastation across Mariupol has been some of the most severe in the conflict, with much of the city reduced to rubble and a widespread humanitarian crisis. Fleeing residents have spoken about a lack of food and water, and bodies of the dead being left in the streets. Speaking to the BBC on Saturday, Mariupol mayor Vadym Boychenko said: ""The citizens who left the city say that hell exists and it's in Mariupol."" With most of the city now under Russian control, the focus remains on the conflict-hit steelworks. Shortly after news of Sunday's wider evacuation project emerged, Mariupol officials said that evacuation from areas of the city other than the Avozstal industrial plant had been put on hold until Monday morning.

One woman, Natalia Usmanova, spoke to told reporters that she had endured ""two months of darkness"" in the industrial complex. About 1,000 civilians have been sheltering in the vast network of underground tunnels and shelters, and concerns were growing about their conditions amid dwindling food and water supplies. © 2022 BBC.

From Monday hens are allowed back outside, after the government lifted restrictions imposed last November requiring them to stay indoors. It means free-range labelling can return to shelves. Since March, the eggs have been classified as ""barn eggs"" in supermarkets due to the length of time birds had been kept inside. Free-range eggs come from hens that have unlimited outdoors access during the daytime. The RSPCA says about 55% of all eggs produced in the UK are free-range. The UK has been facing its largest ever outbreak of avian influenza. While poultry and other captive birds will no longer need to be housed, unless they are in a protection zone, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said other precautions to protect flocks remain in force. They include enhanced cleansing and biosecurity measures. In a joint statement, the four chief veterinary officers said: ""Whilst the lifting of the mandatory housing measures will be welcome news to bird keepers, scrupulous biosecurity remains the most critical form of defence to help keep your birds safe. ""It is thanks to the hard work of all bird keepers and vets, who have played their part in keeping flocks safe this winter, that we are in a position to take this action. ""However, the recent cases of avian influenza show that it's more important than ever for bird keepers to remain vigilant for signs of disease and maintain stringent standards of biosecurity."" Farmers welcomed the move but warned that there are still challenges. ""It's really nice to see the hens outside,"" said Llyr Jones, a poultry farmer. ""Once they've laid their eggs in the morning, the doors open at 9 o'clock and they can have the rest of the day roaming the fields."" Mr Jones, who runs the Derwydd farm in Ruthin in north Wales, said the main challenge for farmers now is rising production costs, after the Ukraine war sent prices soaring. Russia and Ukraine are among the world's biggest producers in agriculture and food. Wheat, a core ingredient in chicken feed, has surged in price in recent months. Mr Jones said that since the start of the war, it's costing him an extra £400 a day to feed his hens. Rising energy and labour costs have added to the strain. ""Unfortunately we can't absorb the costs,"" he said. His concerns are echoed by the British Free Range Egg Producers Association. Its chief executive, Robert Gooch, said it was ""really good news"" that shoppers can once again purchase free-range eggs. ""But while it's a relief to my members, lifting the housing order does not solve the crisis facing the egg sector,"" he said. ""It will not remove the huge hikes in energy, transport, feed and labour costs they are experiencing. The picture is bleak."" Some farmers are calling for retailers to hike egg prices, to help them meet rising costs. But retailers say the market is already tough. Andrew Opie, director of food and sustainability at the British Retail Consortium, said: ""Supermarkets source most of their food from the UK and know they need to pay a sustainable price to farmers but are constrained by how much additional cost they can pass onto consumers in this very difficult market."" More than 100 cases of bird flu have been confirmed across the country since late October. The virus is highly contagious and can destroy poultry flocks. The housing measures were announced by Defra last November in an attempt to minimise the chances of poultry and other captive birds coming into contact with infected wild birds. The risk to human health is extremely low, according to the NHS. "
427,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-61292248,2022-05-01T20:10:02,Ukraine round-up: Mariupol evacuation and pilot legend," The long-awaited evacuation of civilians from a steel plant in the southern Ukrainian city of Mariupol is finally under way. Azovstal is the last Ukrainian hold-out in Mariupol, a port city devastated by Russian shelling. The steelworks has a complex of tunnels and bunkers, making it ideal for guerrilla warfare. Ukrainian officials say about 1,000 civilians and more than 500 wounded soldiers are still there. They have been desperately short of food, water and other supplies. Dozens of civilians have now left, with some going to a Russian-controlled village and others to Ukrainian territory. The UN and Red Cross are both involved in the operation. One of the women evacuated described what it was like sheltering in plant. ""I feared that the bunker would not withstand it - I had terrible fear,"" she told Reuters. ""When the bunker started to shake, I was hysterical, my husband can vouch for that: I was so worried the bunker would cave in. We didn't see the sun for so long,"" You can read our full story on the evacuations here. Ukraine's fighter pilots are vastly outnumbered by the Russians, and have become legendary - thanks in part to the story of an alleged flying ace called the ""Ghost of Kyiv"". The MiG-29 pilot was claimed to have downed as many as 40 enemy planes - despite Russia dominating the skies. But now the Ukraine Air Force Command has warned on Facebook that the ""Ghost of Kyiv is a superhero-legend whose character was created by Ukrainians!"" One military expert told our reporter Laurence Peter the saga ""has helped to raise morale at a time when people need simple stories"". The Speaker of the US House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, pledged continued US support for Ukraine, commenting on her meeting with President Volodymyr Zelensky in Kyiv. ""We're there for the fight, and you cannot fold to a bully,"" she said, adding that Congress would move quickly to approve President Joe Biden's request for $33bn (£26bn) for Ukraine. She led a Congressional delegation to Kyiv and said the discussions centred around ""security, humanitarian assistance and economic assistance and eventually rebuilding when victory is won"". A Russian plan to introduce the rouble in the occupied southern city of Kherson has fuelled local defiance, residents told the BBC. Kherson's Ukrainian mayor, Ihor Kolykhaiev, who has now been overthrown by Russian authorities, says he doesn't believe this will be possible while the only working banking system in the region is Ukrainian, not Russian. Many residents are exchanging any roubles they receive back into Ukraine's currency, the hryvnia. Residents say they are struggling to pay for what few goods there are, as supermarket shelves lie empty. They say that shops, restaurants and businesses have closed and parts of the economy have ground to a halt. As the West goes after the assets of wealthy Russians, the superyacht industry is bracing itself for stormy seas ahead. More than $2bn (£1.5bn) worth of the luxury boats linked to sanctioned Russians have been seized in Europe since Russia invaded Ukraine, Bloomberg estimates. About 10% of the world's superyachts are owned by Russians, and sanctions can affect not only them but also designers, shipyards and crews. "
428,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-61271562,2022-05-01T15:11:29,Asda chairman Stuart Rose: Food prices will keep rising," Food prices will keep rising, and stay higher ""for quite some time"" due to the high cost of raw materials, Asda chairman Lord Rose has said. Many families struggling with the cost of living crisis are ""going to suffer"", the Conservative peer warned - although retailers will try to keep costs down. The Bank of England expects price inflation to hit 8% this spring. But Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said inflation would not necessarily be long term. Families in the UK have been struggling as energy, fuel and food costs rise rapidly. Speaking to the BBC Sunday Morning programme, the Asda chairman said he feared that food prices ""are going to go higher, and they are going to stay high for quite some time"". Pressures on prices include the war in Ukraine and a resurgence of Covid in China, said Lord Rose. Oil and gas prices were already rising rapidly before Russia's invasion of Ukraine, but the war has pushed prices up further. In turn, this is ramping up raw materials costs for manufacturers and retailers - including for meats like chicken and staples such as pasta - with the price hikes being passed on to consumers. ""Chicken feed is going up, and all the other associated costs are going up,"" he said. ""I see no quick solution to this. ""Pasta is made from durum wheat, and durum wheat has gone up in price, so that's an inevitable cost increase."" Co-op chief executive Steve Murrells told the Sunday Times that chicken could become as expensive as beef due to the war in Ukraine. Fast food chain Nando's, which specialises in chicken, said that some of its prices had gone up in April. Lord Rose said retailers ""will do what we can"" to shield customers from raw materials cost increases, but added they were ""not immune from cost increases ourselves"" and would pass them on. He said supermarkets have staff, electricity, fuel, insurance and transport costs, alongside raw materials costs. ""If you're baking biscuits or baking cakes, [energy] goes into the cost of the raw material that you have to pass on [to consumers],"" he said. ""What we have to try and do is mitigate that."" There is a danger of long-term effects on the economy from high inflation including ""a wage spiral"" and ""stagflation"" - where prices and wages go up, but the economy doesn't grow. ""They are both evil, and the government has got a very difficult and tricky road to navigate,"" Lord Rose said. He added that 90% of Asda customers were ""very worried about the cost of living, and how they are going to make ends meet"". Business Secretary Mr Kwarteng said there was ""obviously an issue with cost of living increases"", but ""we don't know how long that will last"". ""Who can say how long any inflation will last?"" he said. ""It's a global issue, there's no doubt that every economy in the world is looking at the high prices and greater inflation."" He the government was ""dealing with it by creating jobs."" High inflation will not necessarily go on for years, Mr Kwarteng added, due to the government's ""energy security strategy"", which includes new nuclear and offshore wind power generation. Labour has repeated calls for a windfall tax on oil and gas companies to subsidise energy bills. Mr Kwarteng said he was against a windfall tax because it would discourage investment, but he said Chancellor Rishi Sunak had not ruled it out. Mr Sunak is ""going to look at all options"", Mr Kwarteng added. Talking about Labour's windfall tax proposals, its leader Sir Keir Starmer told Sky News: ""We are not talking about taxing the profits they expected to make. This is the profits they didn't expect to make. ""We would then use that to reduce energy bills by up to £600."" Labour's shadow foreign secretary David Lammy told the BBC that families dealing with cost of living pressures should not have to face a rise in National Insurance. The government has said this rise will help the NHS recover from Covid and fund social care in England. ""It's absolutely the wrong time for people to face a National Insurance rise,"" he said. ""Let's be clear, we've had 15 tax rises over the last decade from this Conservative government, at a time when four in 10 people are buying less groceries."" Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said inflation would be high for ""at least a year or two"". ""Millions of pensioners and families are really worried about the cost of living,"" he said. ""They're pretty annoyed that the Conservative government seem to be making it worse with tax rises."" Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said: ""This week, as most people received their pay packet, they finally see the reality of the Tory-made cost of living crisis - a hike in National Insurance, soaring bills and no support from Westminster.""

Rend Platings secured a visa for Kristina Korniiuk, 34, from Kyiv, under the Ukraine Sponsorship Scheme. The pair were reunited at Mrs Platings's home in Cambridge on Sunday. ""It feels really, really wonderful,"" Mrs Platings said. ""It's a little bit surreal. And it's kind of quite hard to believe."" Mrs Platings, who said she painted her house blue and yellow to ""to make a statement"" about the Russian invasion, has been friends with Ms Korniiuk for three years and they last saw each other at the beginning of February. Mrs Platings told the Press Association that her reunion with her friend, following a journey which took more than 24 hours, was ""amazing"" and coming to the UK was ""just the right thing to do"". ""I think the first thing I felt was just really relieved, and the second thing was that I just couldn't believe that she's actually here,"" she said. ""I've always wanted her to come, and to show her Cambridge. ""It's just a shame it was in this situation, but on balance we're happier that she's safe. ""I hope that she'll be able to make the most out of it and find that she makes friends over here and that she, instead of losing her country, she kind of gains another community that she can become close to. ""Then hopefully we'll all be able to visit her back in Ukraine when this is all over."" Ms Korniiuk, who stayed in Kyiv for the first three weeks of the invasion before moving to the west of the country, said while she was happy to be in England she would prefer if it was under better circumstances. She said she was worried about her family in the Ukrainian capital, but realised it was her parents' choice to stay there. ""I tried really hard to convince them,"" she said.

This hero is said to have downed as many as 40 enemy planes - an incredible feat in an arena where Russia controls the skies. But now the Ukraine Air Force Command has warned on Facebook that the ""Ghost of Kyiv is a superhero-legend whose character was created by Ukrainians!"". ""We ask the Ukrainian community not to neglect the basic rules of information hygiene,"" the message said, urging people to ""check the sources of information, before spreading it"". Earlier reports had named the ace as Major Stepan Tarabalka, 29. The authorities confirmed that he was killed in combat on 13 March and honoured with a Hero of Ukraine medal posthumously. Now, the air force stresses that ""Tarabalka is not 'Ghost of Kiev', and he did not hit 40 planes"". It describes the ""Ghost of Kyiv"" as ""a collective image of pilots of the Air Force's 40th tactical aviation brigade, who defend the sky over the capital"", rather than a single man's combat record. For weeks, Ukrainians did not have a name to go with the ""Ghost of Kyiv"" - but that did not stop the story going viral on social media. It was used as a marketing brand by a Ukrainian model aircraft manufacturer, while Ukrainian Iryna Kostyrenko showed off a military badge inspired by the legend. And the defence ministry tweeted a video celebrating Tarabalka's heroism. Military experts told the BBC they doubted that one pilot could have downed as many as 40 Russian planes. Ukrainian military historian Mikhail Zhirohov described the Ghost of Kyiv story as ""propaganda for raising morale"". Speaking to the BBC from Chernihiv, he said that early on in the war the Russians dominated Ukrainian airspace, so a Ukrainian pilot ""could only shoot down two or three"". ""It's essential to have this propaganda, because our armed forces are smaller, and many think we can't be equal to them [the Russians]. We need this in wartime,"" he said. The fact that Ukrainian pilots are still denying Russia total mastery of the skies, flying inferior, older Russian-designed MiG-29s, inspired this modern legend. With all its military might, Russia has had more than two months to knock out Ukraine's air defences - and failed. The Ukrainian authorities fuelled the Ghost of Kyiv legend just days into the war. The Ukraine Security Service (SBU) showed a fighter pilot on the Telegram messaging service, with a caption calling the ""Ghost of Kyiv"" an ""angel"" for downing 10 Russian planes. But it did not name the ""angel"", and media reports later said the photo used was an old one. A Ukrainian military expert who requested anonymity told the BBC the Ghost of Kyiv story ""has helped to raise morale at a time when people need simple stories"". Ukraine's morale has also been boosted by the Moskva story. First, Ukrainian border guards defied the Russian missile cruiser with a rude gesture, commemorated with a popular postage stamp. Then Ukraine allegedly sank it - the pride of Russia's Black Sea Fleet - with two Neptune missiles. Russia admitted there was a fire on board, and that the ship sank, but made no mention of a missile attack. Heroic fighter pilots have entered the national mythology of other countries too. The UK celebrates the brave Royal Air Force pilots who outwitted the mighty Nazi Luftwaffe in the 1940 Battle of Britain. And Russia itself glorifies the sacrifices of its World War Two pilots, who were outgunned by the Germans. Some deliberately crashed into enemy planes after running out of bullets. Legends like the Ghost of Kyiv are not surprising when there are such contrasting figures given for Russian and Ukrainian losses: there is plenty of room for embellishment. On 30 April, the Ukrainian Armed Forces General Staff said that in the war so far Russia had lost 190 planes and 155 helicopters. But independent military analysts Oryx reckon the Russian losses to be 26 planes and 39 helicopters, as well as 48 drones (UAVs). Both Russia and Ukraine are very secretive about their own losses. Counting is difficult, because aircraft often crash in Russian-held territory, and some manage to land in Russia. Experts agree that in most cases Russian aircraft were downed with surface-to-air missiles, especially man-portable air defence systems (Manpads). Justin Crump of the security consultancy Sybilline says the Ghost of Kyiv legend is important because in our social media age ""people need myths, heroes and legends, to provide cohesion and meaning"".

""I wasn't sure I'd make it back to Kyiv so coming back is an extraordinary thing,"" Melinda Simmons said in an interview with the Observer. ""It absolutely feels like the right place to be,"" she said, although she acknowledged the potential risks. Russia has previously made threats against diplomats based in Kyiv. Earlier this week, a Russian statement said forces were primed to carry out strikes against ""decision-making centres in Kyiv"". It added that the presence of foreign advisers in those sites ""will not necessarily be a problem to Russia deciding to take retaliatory action"". Britain started withdrawing some embassy staff from Kyiv in January, shortly before the war started. Ms Simmons left Kyiv in late February, although stayed in Ukraine for a little while longer before returning to London. But Boris Johnson announced last month that the British embassy in Kyiv would be reopening. Ms Simmons told the newspaper that as she drove into the city on Friday she got ""a real sense of what was going on... and it's truly shocking"". ""But what is equally extraordinary is to see how Ukraine kept Russia out of Kyiv. Every way in which Ukraine has been able to do that is a thing to celebrate and to treasure,"" she said. Russian forces withdrew from around Kyiv after failing to seize the city, and is now instead focusing its assault on the eastern Donbas region. Ms Simmons said she expected the war would likely last ""certainly through this year and probably through next year"", which chimes with other warnings from the West that they must be prepared for the long haul. And she made clear she was not minimising the risk facing her, adding: ""I am here with a heightened level of security protection and bearing in mind that potential risk, but for now I feel comfortable working under those circumstances."" Although the PM said the embassy was reopening soon, Ms Simmons said the Kyiv embassy had not yet reopened and they were not running a consular service. She also repeated the British government's advice that UK citizens should not travel to Ukraine. Earlier this week, the Foreign Office announced one British national was killed and another was missing. Meanwhile, Mr Johnson spoke to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky over the phone on Saturday, and was given an update on the fighting in eastern Ukraine, as well as the situation in the southern port city of Mariupol. Mr Johnson confirmed the UK would continue to provide additional military aid for Ukraine to defend themselves, Downing Street said. ""The leaders also discussed progress of the UN-led effort to evacuate Mariupol and concern for the injured there. The prime minister offered the UK's continued economic and humanitarian support,"" a Downing Street spokesperson added. "

However, Kherson's Ukrainian mayor, Ihor Kolykhaiev, who has now been overthrown by Russian authorities, has said that he doesn't believe this will be possible while the only working banking system in the region is Ukrainian, not Russian. Despite being occupied for 60 days, many residents are trying to find small ways to defy the Russian forces - like exchanging any roubles they receive back into Ukraine's currency, the hryvnia. But there are very few ways to safely snub the Russian army when it occupies your streets. Z signs - a Russian pro-war symbol - have appeared around the city. Russian flags hang above Kherson's government buildings. Ukrainian TV has been mostly cut off, changed to Russian news. Russian soldiers drive armoured vehicles through the city centre, between a network of check points. Now, changing the region's currency is yet another bid to erase Ukrainian identity from the city. ""I think most people will leave here if the rouble is introduced,"" Olga, who didn't want to use her real name, told me from inside Kherson. ""At the moment there are still currency exchanges operating in the city. If I am paid in roubles, I think I will just go and exchange it for hryvnia, I think others will too. It's just a small act of protest."" Olga is not the only one with this plan. Ukrainian news reports have said that some pensions have been handed out in roubles around Kherson, but that people have already exchanged it back into Ukrainian hryvnia. Life in Kherson has become increasingly difficult. Many now feel nervous about even speaking to a journalist. When we reach Olga and ask how she is feeling, she sighs. ""I'm alive and I have food,"" she says. Around 40% of the population have fled in the two months since this key, strategic city was taken by Russia, according to the mayor. Many residents tell us about their struggle to pay for what few goods there are, as supermarket shelves lie empty. They say that shops, restaurants and businesses have closed and parts of the economy have ground to a halt, cut off from much of the world. Earlier this week, Russian forces appointed a new administration in Kherson because Mr Kolykhaiev was ""not cooperating"" with the occupied forces, according to Russian state news agency Ria. Speaking on video call from somewhere in the region, with piles of binders and a toy camouflage jeep sitting on shelves behind him, Mr Kolykhaiev says he has not stopped working. He is sceptical of whether Russia can successfully introduce the rouble. ""I have no confirmation that it's been introduced,"" he says. ""When can it appear? When the treasury and the banking system of Ukraine will stop working? Anything can happen under occupation, I can't get into Russia's head to find out what they are thinking. If they do try to introduce the rouble zone here, we would be plunged back into 1992 when Ukraine gained its independence."" Ukrainian authorities had suggested that Russia could try to hold a referendum in the region on 1 May, asking voters whether they want independence from Ukraine. Any attempt to do this would be seen as a way to legitimise Russia's intervention, suggesting that residents no longer want to be part of Ukraine and painting Russia as liberators. Russia held a referendum in Crimea after Moscow annexed it in 2014, and also in the Russian-backed separatist areas of Donetsk and Luhansk. Russia has denied plans to hold a vote in Kherson, and for now residents in the city say they've seen no sign of it. Rumours swirl on social media channels about what could happen. Some Ukrainians are worried that Russia will simply fake the result and use records of their identity documents - which they fear the Russians could gain access to in the administrative buildings they now occupy - to back it up. ""I'm not sure they even need the population here to know that there is a referendum,"" says Olga. ""I guess they can do it without us. Maybe I already voted."" Several people inside Kherson told us that the routes out to safer parts of Ukraine have now been shut altogether. The only road available is through Crimea which means travelling into Russian territory, something several Ukrainians told us they would not be prepared to do. Maxim felt this was his only route to safety. He didn't want his name to be used as his family are still inside the city. At the border he was subject to a long interrogation as a security guard inspected his body for tattoos. ""It was like a film,"" he said. ""You sit on a suitcase under the scorching sun to be interrogated. I would never have imagined I would have to go through this. I was really horrified, because it's scary - people with machine guns are walking past you."" His favourite artist almost got him into difficulties. ""They were asking me the same questions on repeat,"" he says. ""I have a David Bowie lightning tattoo and they asked me 'Is that Azov?'"" The Azov battalion are a controversial regiment that was originally a far-right group later incorporated into Ukraine's National Guard. Maxim says that many of the cars in the queue had Kherson number plates. He has since safely travelled through Georgia and on to Europe. ""Reaching Georgia was like being released from jail,"" he says. ""You feel like you've got your human rights back."" For those still in Kherson there are deep fears about the future. ""I am afraid of a humanitarian catastrophe,"" says Mr Kolykhaiev. ""I am worried for the people who are still in the city today. They are all hostages. ""It's like we started with 100 litres of petrol in the car tank and we are driving until the gas runs out. I want to calculate how long we can keep driving. How long can we carry the city?"" "

""Russian troops are gradually increasing the intensity of their offensive in eastern Ukraine,"" Ukrainian defence ministry spokesman Oleksandr Motuzyanyk warned. ""There are signs that the aggressor is preparing for an even bigger activation of military actions."" The warning comes as Western officials painted a picture of the invading forces facing serious problems. The UK Ministry of Defence said on Saturday that Russia has been forced to merge and redeploy ""depleted and disparate units"" from its failed attempt to seize territory in Ukraine' north-east, combining them into its renewed focus on the east of the country. But what Russia calls its ""special military operation"" is ""proceeding strictly according to plan"", according to the Kremlin. Meanwhile, about twenty civilians have left the besieged Azovstal industrial complex in Mariupol - the first such release since Russia's President Vladimir Putin announced he was locking down Ukraine's last bastion in the city. Hundreds remain at the steelworks in Mariupol. Wives, sisters and mothers of Ukrainian fighters trapped there have come to Kyiv to plead with the government to do more to get the men out. They say they're even ready to act as a human shield, if that helps evacuate the men to safety. ""When they talk about green corridors or extraction, they talk about civilians not military, and I am really worried. The military are also people,"" Olga, one of the women, told the BBC. ""They're in the real hell there, and it's so much worse than simple war."" Read more from the BBC's Sarah Rainsford in Kyiv from our live page entry. Sometimes, surviving a bombing isn't the end of the ordeal. Ukrainians lucky enough to escape serious injury might still find themselves dealing with unexploded ordnance on their property. That's where the bomb disposal unit - part of Ukraine's State Emergency Service - comes in. The BBC's Carrie Davies followed the team on a run though the Black Sea city of Mykolaiv, which is subjected to near-daily shelling by artillery, as they check to make sure the remaining shells and debris are safe. If you live in the UK, US, or most of Europe, you may be baffled at Russia's claims about what's happening in Ukraine - that it is there to protect people, and that Russia is a victim of Western aggression. But it's not just Russia that flirts with this version of events. A UN vote to condemn the invasion passed by 141 out of 193 votes. That means more than a quarter of member nations didn't vote at all, abstained, or sided with Russia. Why? As the BBC's security correspondent Frank Gardner explains, ""it would be delusional for Western leaders to believe that the entire world shares Nato's view - that Russia is entirely to blame for this catastrophic war - because it doesn't"". Late on Friday, US defence department spokesman John Kirby became visibly emotional during a press conference and accused the Russian president of ""depravity"" over his actions in Ukraine. Today, Russia hit back, describing Mr Kirby's comments as ""offensive and unacceptable"". The Russian ambassador in Washington said the spokesman was ""resorting to street insults"". ""It has become a norm here that administration officials base their judgments on dirty lies of the Ukrainian authorities,"" Anatoly Antonov added.

The actress has for many years worked as a special envoy for the United Nations, focusing on major crises that force people from their homes and spur the movement of refugees. This visit, however, is in a ""private humanitarian capacity"", her office says. A statement says she met with orphaned and displaced children, including some evacuated from hard-hit Mariupol, as well as doctors and volunteers caring for them. ""I'm humbled to witness the resilience and courage and dignity of the Ukrainian people in the face of the terror and trauma of a war they did not choose,"" Jolie says.

They are the first group to leave since Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered the vast industrial area sealed off last week. Talks are ongoing about freeing the reported 1,000 civilians still trapped inside. Russia is meanwhile said to be stepping up its offensive in the east. More than a week ago, after saying Mariupol had been captured, President Putin told his troops: ""Block off this industrial area so that a fly cannot not pass through."" But Russian media have reported that 25 civilians managed to leave the Azovstal plant on Saturday, including six children under the age of 14 - but did not say where the group had been taken. That was confirmed by soldiers inside the steelworks, who put the number at 20 women and children. The deputy commander of the Azov regiment, Sviatoslav Palamar, said they were ""transferred to a suitable place and we hope that they will be evacuated to Zaporizhzhia, on territory controlled by Ukraine."" Mariupol's mayor, Vadym Boychenko, told the BBC that people there were ""on the borderline between life and death"". ""[People] are waiting, they are praying for a rescue… It's difficult to say how many days or hours we have to save their lives."" Taking Mariupol would aid Moscow's plans to seize the entire south coast of Ukraine, which would unite pro-Russia separatist regions such as Donetsk and Luhansk in eastern Ukraine with Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014. It would also increase access to the pro-Russia Transnistria area across Ukraine's western border in Moldova. On Saturday, three loud explosions were heard in the south-west port city Odesa, which officials said destroyed the runway of the airport rendering it unusable. A Ukrainian Defence Ministry spokesperson, Oleksandr Motuzyanyk, said Russian troops ""are gradually increasing the intensity of their offensive in eastern Ukraine simultaneously along all directions"". Moscow withdrew its troops from regions around the capital, Kyiv, weeks ago to redeploy them to the east of Ukraine. ""There are signs that the aggressor is preparing for an even bigger activation of military actions,"" Col Motuzyanyk said. Western officials have said Moscow is facing significant challenges in the east. The UK Ministry of Defence said Russia has been ""forced to merge and redeploy depleted and disparate units from the failed advances"" and ""many of these units are likely suffering from weakened morale"". That echoed statements by US officials overnight that Russia was ""at least several days behind where they wanted to be"". In other developments Saturday: The Russian defence ministry said it had hit 17 military targets in Ukraine on Saturday with missiles and air strikes, killing more than 200 Ukrainians along with 23 armoured vehicles and other military equipment. Each side in the conflict makes regular claims - which cannot be verified by the BBC - about the losses inflicted on the other. "

Ashbourne Elim Church hosted the meeting to give the refugees and their hosts chance to meet others in similar situations.

Galina Ryzhenko said despite fleeing Kyiv in February it had taken seven weeks for her mum Tanya to join her in South Yorkshire. Ms Ryzhenko held a lone protest outside a Home Office building in Sheffield. The Home Office said it had ""launched one of the fastest and biggest visa schemes in UK history"". The software manager has lived and worked in South Yorkshire for five years and applied for her mother to join her soon after the war broke out.

Spokesman John Kirby became visibly emotional as he asked how anyone ""moral"" could justify the atrocities committed by Russia. But Russia's ambassador to the US Anatoly Antonov has rejected the accusation. He described Mr Kirby's comment as ""offensive and unacceptable"". Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Friday he was still open to peace talks with Mr Putin. But he said there was a high risk they could collapse amid Russian aggression. Speaking to Polish media, Mr Zelensky said he wanted to meet Mr Putin because ""a single man decides everything"" in Russia. But the destruction left by Russian forces in occupied areas has made any discussions tenuous, he said. ""After Bucha and Mariupol people just want to kill them. When there is such attitude, it is hard to talk about anything."" On Thursday, Ukraine announced a hunt for 10 Russian soldiers accused of war crimes in Bucha - a suburb north of Kyiv where at least 400 civilians were killed. ""I don't think we fully appreciated the degree to which [Mr Putin] would visit that kind of violence and cruelty,"" Mr Kirby said on Friday. He dismissed Mr Putin's stated justifications for the invasion - that he is protecting Russians and Ukraine from Nazism - adding: ""It's hard to square that rhetoric by what he's actually doing inside Ukraine to innocent people, shot in the back of the head, hands tied behind their backs, pregnant women being killed, hospitals being bombed."" But Mr Antonov accused Kirby of ""resorting to street insults"". ""It has become a norm here that administration officials base their judgments on dirty lies of the Ukrainian authorities,"" the Russian ambassador added. The BBC's Joel Gunter in Kyiv said there is growing evidence that Russia has forcibly deported large numbers of civilians across the border since it invaded the country in February. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said in an interview published on Saturday that more than one million people have been evacuated from Ukraine to Russia since the war began in February. Mr Lavrov told China's state news agency Xinhua that it included some 120,000 foreigners, in addition to hundreds of thousands of people from the Russian-backed breakaway regions of eastern Ukraine - Donetsk and Luhansk. Ukraine's deputy prime minister told the BBC that Moscow has attempted to trade Ukrainian civilians for Russian military prisoners - a move forbidden by the Geneva Convention. Russia confirmed on Friday that its military had conducted an air strike in Ukraine's capital during a visit by the UN's secretary general. Journalist Vira Hyrch was killed in the attack - the first of its kind in Kyiv in nearly two weeks - after the residential building she lived in was hit by a missile. Russia's defence ministry said it had deployed ""high-precision, long-range air-based weapons"" to target a missile factory in Kyiv. Now more than two months into the war, US President Joe Biden has asked Congress for $33bn (£27bn) in military, economic and humanitarian aid for Ukraine - a major ramp-up of American support for Ukraine. The bumper package has been held up by congressional infighting over US domestic priorities, but US Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi said on Friday she hoped to get it passed ""as soon as possible"". In Kyiv, Mr Zelensky called the bill's passage ""concrete proof"" that freedom can defend itself against oppression. ""I am sure now that the Lend-Lease will help Ukraine and the whole free world to beat the ideological successors of the Nazis, who started a war against us,"" he said in a late night address on Friday. And the UK also said it was deploying some 8,000 troops for exercises across eastern Europe in a show of the Western world's resolve against Russia's continued aggression. "

442,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-61272203,2022-04-29T23:24:28,Ukraine - the narrative the West doesn't hear," ""Ukraine and its allies, including London, are threatening Russia for the last 1,000 years, to move Nato to our borders, to cancel our culture - they have bullied us for many, many years."" That is what Yevgeny Popov, a member of the Russian Duma (parliament) and an influential TV host in Russia, told the BBC's Ukrainecast on 19 April. ""Of course Nato plans for Ukraine are a direct threat to Russian citizens."" His views were both surprising and enlightening as to the very different narrative put out by the Kremlin, compared to the way it's viewed in the West. To European and Western ears, these pronouncements sound almost unfathomable, even amounting to a blatant disregard for carefully documented evidence. Yet these are just some of the beliefs held not only by Kremlin supporters in Russia and across the wider population there but also in several other parts of the world. After Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine on 24 February, the UN held an emergency vote - 141 nations out of 193 UN member states voted a week later to condemn it. But a number of major countries chose to abstain, including China, India and South Africa. So it would be delusional for Western leaders to believe that the entire world shares Nato's view - that Russia is entirely to blame for this catastrophic war - because it doesn't. So why are so many countries on the fence about Russia's invasion? There are many reasons, ranging from straightforward economic or military self-interest, to accusations of Western hypocrisy to Europe's colonial past. There is no one-size-fits-all. Every country may have its own particular reasons for not wanting to publicly condemn Russia or alienate President Putin. Let's start with China, the world's most populous state with more than 1.4 billion people, most of whom get their news on Ukraine from the state-controlled media, just as most people do in Russia. China received a high-profile visitor to its Winter Olympics shortly before the Ukraine invasion began on 24 February - President Putin. A Chinese communique issued afterwards said there ""was no limit to the two countries' co-operation"". So did Putin tip off his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping that he was about to launch a full-scale invasion of Ukraine? Absolutely not, says China, but it's hard to imagine that there would have not been even just a hint of what was to come to such an important neighbour. China and Russia may one day end up being strategic rivals, but today they are partners and share a common disdain, bordering on enmity, for Nato, the West and its democratic values. China has already clashed with the US over Chinese military expansion into the South China Sea. Beijing has also clashed with Western governments over its treatment of its Uighur population, its crushing of democracy in Hong Kong and its frequently repeated vow to ""return Taiwan to the fold"", by force if necessary. So China and Russia have a common enemy in Nato, and their governments' worldview percolates down to both countries' populations with the result that, for the most part, they simply do not share the West's abhorrence of Russia's invasion and alleged war crimes. India and Pakistan have their own reasons for not wanting to antagonise Russia. India gets much of its arms from Moscow and, after its recent clash with China in the Himalayas, India is betting that one day it may need Russia as an ally and protector. Pakistan's recently ousted Prime Minister, Imran Khan, has been a fierce critic of the West, especially the US. Pakistan also receives arms from Russia and it needs Moscow's blessing to help secure trade routes into its northern hinterland of Central Asia. Prime Minister Khan went ahead with a pre-planned visit to see President Putin on 24 February, the very day Russia invaded Ukraine. Both India and Pakistan abstained in the UN vote to condemn the invasion. Then there is the accusation, shared by many, especially in Muslim-majority countries, that the West, led by its most powerful nation - the US - is guilty of hypocrisy and double standards. In 2003, the US and UK chose to bypass the UN - and much of world opinion - by invading Iraq on spurious grounds, leading to years of violence. Washington and London have also been accused of helping to prolong the civil war in Yemen, by arming the Royal Saudi Air Force which conducts frequent airstrikes there in support of the country's official government. For many states in Africa there are other, even more historic reasons at play. In Soviet times, Moscow poured arms into the continent as it sought to confront US and Western influence from the Sahara to the Cape. In some places, a legacy of western European colonisation in the 19th and 20th centuries is a lasting resentment of the West that plays out even today. France, which rushed troops into Mali in 2013 - to prevent an Al-Qaeda takeover of the whole country - is not popular in its former colony. So now the bulk of French troops have left, to be replaced by the Kremlin-backed Russian mercenaries of the Wagner Group. And where does the Middle East stand on this? No surprises that Syria - along with North Korea, Belarus and Eritrea - has backed Russia's invasion. Syria's President Bashar Al-Assad relies heavily on Russia for his survival after his country risked being overrun by ISIS fighters in 2015. But even long-time Western allies, like Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) although they backed the UN vote, have been relatively muted in their criticism of Moscow. The UAE's de facto ruler, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed, has a good relationship with Vladimir Putin - his previous ambassador to Moscow has been on hunting trips with him. It is also worth remembering that Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has a largely dysfunctional relationship with President Biden. Such is their mutual dislike, that the two men reportedly refuse to take each other's phone calls. Before that, when the world's leaders gathered in Buenos Aires for the G20 Summit - in late 2018, just weeks after the West accused the Saudi crown prince of ordering the grisly murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi - most Western leaders gave the Saudi prince the cold shoulder. Putin, by contrast, high-fived him. That's not something the Saudi leader will have forgotten in a hurry. None of this means that all those countries mentioned actively support this invasion, apart from Belarus. Only five states voted in favour of it on 2 March at the UN, and one of those was Russia. But what it does mean is that, for multiple reasons, the West cannot assume the rest of the world shares its view of Putin, nor of the sanctions, nor of the West's willingness to openly confront Russia's invasion with ever more lethal supplies of weaponry to Ukraine.

The US was unequivocal on Friday. ""It's brutality of the coldest and the most depraved sort,"" John Kirby, a defence department spokesman, told reporters. ""I don't think we fully appreciated the degree to which [Putin] would visit that kind of violence and cruelty... on innocent people, "" he said. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky earlier said there was a high chance the actions of Russia's military could derail peace talks. He has repeatedly accused Moscow of war crimes. Russia denies those accusations, and its Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov blamed the stalling talks on Kyiv's desire to ""constantly play games"". So the war of words is continuing - and it would appear any resolution to this conflict is some way off. Given the anger at Russia's behaviour on the ground, it's worth considering some of the allegations we've heard. Our reporter Joel Gunter spoke to Ukrainian Nikita Horban who was abducted from his village and taken across the border to Russia. He would come back without any toes. Nikita, who was handed back to Ukraine as part of a prisoner exchange, told the harrowing story of his weeks-long ordeal. The prisoner swaps are being negotiated by Ukraine's deputy prime minister, Iryna Vereshchuk, who confirmed that Nikita had been sent back from Russia. ""There were badly injured people in this exchange... there were clear signs of torture,"" she said. You can read the full report here. Ukraine, meanwhile, is working to capture 10 Russian troops it accuses of war crimes. The Ministry of Defence - which shared pictures of the soldiers - described them as ""the despicable 10"". Prosecutors say they are being investigated for ""premeditated murder"" in Bucha, the town outside the capital Kyiv where civilians were tortured, raped and murdered. They are also accused of holding innocent civilians hostage, beating them and looting homes. Moscow has denied any crimes were committed in Bucha, Read more on this story here. On Friday, Radio Liberty, a Ukrainian station, confirmed that one of its journalists had been killed in Russian rocket strikes on Kyiv on Thursday evening. Vira Hyrych was at home when a rocket hit the residential building where she lived, it said. Her body was pulled from the wreckage on Friday.

The interest payments, totalling $650m, were made in dollars, it said. On Friday Russia's central bank chief Elvira Nabiullina told journalists that ""there cannot be any talk of default"" but acknowledged that there were ""difficulties with payments"". Questions had grown about whether Moscow would be able to meet its obligations as a 4 May deadline loomed. Payments on the country's $40bn of international bonds must be made in the currency originally specified. But Russia has lost access to much of its reserve funds held in foreign banks, due to sanctions imposed by the West and allies in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Earlier this month Moscow proposed fulfilling its obligations regarding these particular bonds in roubles, a suggestion rejected by Moody's and other credit ratings agencies. The credit ratings agencies said payment in anything other than dollars would amount to a default, which would have significant implications for Russia's economy, including the ability to borrow in future. Russia last defaulted on rouble-denominated debt in 1998 when the country went through a financial crisis. It defaulted on its foreign currency debt in 1918, following the Bolshevik revolution. At that time Vladimir Lenin, the revolutionary leader refused to recognise the debt obligations inherited from the tsarist regime. A 30-day grace period, following Russia's initial failure to make payments on the two bonds in question, is due to expire on 4 May, by which time investors must have received the money they are owed. Russia said it had made the payments to the London branch of Citibank, one of the banks responsible for disbursing the payments. A US official said the payments had been made, but not using frozen dollar assets from within the US. Russia's difficulties are likely to increase before 25 May, when sanctions rules are due to change, limiting further whether western agents are permitted to process Russian debt payments. Russia cut interest rates on Friday by 3% to try to boost the flagging economy. The main lending rate, which was raised in the immediate aftermath of the invasion, is now at 14%. "

Lilya Onopa and her six boys, aged between four and 14, are waiting to come to Chepstow, Monmouthshire. The Home Secretary Priti Patel was urged to intervene after only five of their seven visas had been approved. But their UK sponsor said he has been told by his local MP the family will be able to travel in the coming days. Lilya and her sons lived in Mar'ivka, a village in central Ukraine, but were left stranded in temporary accommodation in Romania after fleeing the war. She had read a BBC Wales story about plans to house up to eight Ukrainian refugees in a bungalow on the site of St Mary's RC Primary school refurbished by volunteers. Phil Cotterell, chairman of the school governors, then sponsored the family to come to Wales. He said he has been informed by Monmouth David Davies that the Home Office has completed the process and the family will be able to pick up their documents in Bucharest in the next couple of days.

The non-profit Presidium Network said Paul Urey and Dylan Healy were detained at a checkpoint in southern Ukraine on Monday. The Foreign Office is said to be urgently seeking more information. Mr Urey's mother said she was extremely worried for his welfare, because he has type 1 diabetes and needs insulin. Meanwhile, Russia has released a video of a man who it says has surrendered to Russian troops. The man, who is wearing a military camouflage uniform, said he was called Andrew Hill, from Plymouth, and has children and a partner. In the video, the man who is shown with a cast on his arm, asked if he was safe and if he could be taken to a hospital. The video has not been verified by the BBC and it is not clear whether the man is speaking under duress. The two captured aid workers are believed to have been working independently, but were in touch with the Presidium Network. They were said to be trying to rescue a family from a village south of the city of Zaporizhzhia at the time of their capture. In a statement passed on by Presidium, Mr Urey's mother Linda said she was ""extremely worried"". Speaking to the BBC at her home near Preston, she said she had not been able to eat or sleep. ""I miss him, I can't cope with it,"" Ms Urey said. ""Please give him back, he's a family man, he's my carer."" Ms Urey said before leaving the UK, her son, who is in his 40s, said he could not sit there and ""watch people dying"". ""Please let him come home to me, to his kids, to his dog,"" she said. Presidium said Mr Urey, who is is from Warrington, Cheshire, had previously spent eight years as a civilian contractor in Afghanistan. He had been living in Leyland, Lancashire, prior to travelling to Ukraine. Mr Healy is described as a chef by training, originally from Huntingdon in Cambridgeshire. He was driving the car at the time of the men's capture, Presidium said. Presidium Network's founder, Dominik Byrne, told the BBC it had taken the men six hours of negotiation to get through the last Ukrainian checkpoint and into Russian-controlled territory, where they were detained. Mr Byrne said he was making an appeal on behalf of the captured men ""to get the support we need from the UK government and from the international community, as well as on the ground"". He said he also wanted ""to get clarification about how they are and how safe they are"" and to know whether they were being ""treated properly"". On Thursday, the government confirmed that one Briton had been killed in Ukraine and another was missing. Sources in Ukraine told the BBC the dead man is Scott Sibley, who is understood to have been fighting for Ukrainian forces.

About 400 are thought to have already made the journey from their war-torn country to their new home here. Most refugees flew into Dublin and then travelled across the border to Northern Ireland. The visas are under the UK Home Office's Homes for Ukraine scheme, and are sponsored by Northern Ireland residents. It is now more than two months since Russia invaded Ukraine. Belfast has the highest number of visa sponsors (95), followed by Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon, and Newry, Mourne and Down, which each had 90 applicants to date. Help centres have been set up in Belfast, Newry, Craigavon and Ballymena. A spokesperson for the Executive Office at Stormont said: ""Over the past two weeks we have helped around 240 Ukrainian people at the assistance centres. ""The available figures for the Homes for Ukraine Scheme show that 598 visas have been issued to applicants being sponsored by Northern Ireland residents (as of 26 April)."" The number of visas issued to applicants being sponsored by residents in Northern Ireland, broken down by council area, are: There have been complaints about the length of time the UK visa application process takes, and reports some refugees have given up trying to leave Ukraine due to the delays. By Claire Graham, BBC News NI A Ukrainian family being sponsored by hosts in County Fermanagh is ""running out of money"" while waiting for visas, according to the man hoping to bring them to Northern Ireland. Their sponsor Barry Mylam said it had been nearly six weeks since they started the process together under the Homes for Ukraine Scheme. Although the family of five have been granted visas, the children aged two and six still haven't received the necessary papers because of their type of passport. The family has decided to cross back into war-torn Ukraine and travel to a passport office in Kiev to collect new biometric passports for the children and restart the application process. ""That's two days driving into a war-zone, gong to the passport office and two days driving back again,"" said Mr Mylam. ""It's terrible that our government is putting their lives at risk for the sake of a bit of paper. ""They did the sensible thing, they left with enough money to support themselves for a few weeks. ""But they're getting to the stage now where our delays have been so long that they are running out of money. ""Their intent is to drive here in their car but they can only hold on so much longer paying for accommodation before that's going to be a problem for them. The Home Office said: ""In response to Putin's barbaric invasion we have launched one of the fastest and biggest visa schemes in UK history. ""All applications from families are normally processed together, but cases differ in complexity and it is vital that robust safeguarding processes are in place to protect children from trafficking and other risks."" Ian Snowden, head of the Ukrainian support team in Northern Ireland, said he expected the system to speed up. ""Over 1,000 Ukrainian people have applied to come here through the Homes for Ukraine sponsor scheme, and that's on top of the family connections scheme,"" he said. ""The Home Office is really speeding up the pace at which they're approving those visa applications. ""I think over the course of May we'll start to see a lot more people coming in.

He told graduates he was ""shocked"" by the images coming from Ukraine, adding that the conflict ""highlighted the importance of alliances"". The prince gave his speech in his role as Marshal of the RAF.

In his speech, the prince said: ""We are all shocked by the images of war in our continent and the effects of air-delivered weapons. ""For air forces, the fighting in Ukraine has clearly demonstrated that despite technological complexity of modern aerial warfare, having highly-motivated and well-trained people remains critical to operational success."" Wearing full ceremonial dress and sword, Prince Charles told the newly graduated pilots: ""Owing to the many daily threats and stresses we face at home and abroad, much will be asked of you in the years ahead, particularly as the service begins to shift its weight increasingly towards space, cyber, data and information warfare.""

The war in Ukraine has disrupted the flow of sunflower oil to the UK food industry and supplies are running out. Suppliers can already switch to using rapeseed oil due to what the watchdog says are ""extraordinary circumstances"". The substitute oils are now being used in some products without changes to the labels being made. The FSA said at the beginning of April that food manufacturers were allowed to switch the ingredients without having to print new packaging, but on Friday the watchdog gave more details about the types of oils that can be switched in. It said the risk of allergic reactions from palm oil and coconut oil is low, and the risk from soybean oil is ""negligible"". The FSA added that this was a temporary measure and that suppliers should print accurate labels as soon as possible. Emily Miles, chief executive of the Food Standards Agency, said:  ""It is an absolute priority for us that food is safe, and what it says it is. ""If industry decisions are made around the substitutions of these oils, we expect accurate labels to be prepared and printed as soon as possible so that consumers can be confident in the food they buy.

The Ministry of Defence - which shared pictures of the soldiers - described them as ""the despicable 10"". Prosecutors say they are being investigated for ""premeditated murder"". They are also accused of holding innocent civilians hostage, beating them and looting homes. Moscow has denied any crimes were committed in Bucha, which was under the control of the 64th motorised infantry brigade for more than a month at the start of the war. Russia's President Vladimir Putin gave the brigade an honorary title - recognising what he says was ""mass heroism and valour, tenacity and courage"" - on its return home. But in the time the brigade controlled Bucha, hundreds were killed. A mass grave was discovered at the church after the town's liberation, while bodies had been left lining the streets where they fell. Thousands of war crimes were documented by investigators. One of those who survived, Vitaliy Zhyvotovskyi, recalled the screams he heard to news agency AFP. ""We had no hope,"" he said, remembering how they used to tremble ""not because of the cold, but due to fear because we could hear what the Russians did to the captives"". On Thursday, Ukraine's prosecutor general Iryna Venediktova announced they had identified the 10 suspects in particular, sharing pictures of the young men. In a Facebook post, she explained they ""are suspected of cruel treatment of civilians and other violations of laws and customs of war"". ""The suspects will be declared wanted in order to detain them and bring them to justice,"" the statement added, appealing for any other information. Stephen Wilkinson, the manager of the Diakonia International Humanitarian Law Centre in Sweden, points out that the chance of a successful prosecution is quite low if they are in Russia. However, the 64th motorised infantry brigade is now back Ukraine, having moved east to Izium - on the frontline of the battle for the Donbas region. According to reports, it has suffered heavy losses. If the 10 are still with the brigade - and still alive - it is not impossible they will be found and tried. Indeed, back in 2014, Ukraine successfully prosecuted two Russian soldiers for ""terrorism"" after they were captured in the east. They were later handed back to Russia in a prisoner exchange. ""Domestic prosecutions are often the best and quickest way,"" Mr Wilkinson adds, despite the focus on international mechanisms such as the International Criminal Court in the Hague. The fact they are ""foot soldiers"" rather than commanders may also make prosecution easier, Mr Wilkinson says - although ""that doesn't remove the need to look into criminal responsibility of the commanders"". However, there are elements of the Ukrainians fight for justice which have raised some cause for concern for Mr Wilkinson. In particular, the way the photos have been distributed online. ""Even if you know there is strong evidence, the law states innocent until proven guilty. What about a free and fair trial? There is a lot of emotion behind this. I would say it puts it at risk, although doesn't fundamentally undermine it."" It has also emerged that an earlier list of the brigade released by Ukrainian authorities may have included a number of names of people from Tajikistan who were no longer serving in the unit. ""It is not known how many Tajiks in the brigade were in Ukraine, but eight Tajiks, whose names were mentioned in the list, and their relatives claim that they were not there,"" Radio Liberty's Tajik Service Ozodi said. None of the names mentioned match the list released on Thursday. "

Nearly 3,000 packets of morning-after pills have been sent to areas of the country most affected by the Russian invasion. The International Planned Parenthood Federation (IPPF) has provided the pills, which volunteers are delivering. Caroline Hickson, from the group, says timing is really important for when they are distributed. ""You have a window of five days in which [the morning-after pill] is effective in preventing pregnancy,"" she told the BBC. ""So if you have been a victim of gender-based violence it's important you can take it as soon as possible, because being pregnant as a result of rape is incredibly traumatic."" The organisation has also been sending medical abortion pills, which can be used up to 24 weeks of pregnancy. Ms Hickson said the pills are there to help women in many different situations, including those who are having consensual sex but feel it is the wrong time to have a baby. ""Before the war it was possible to obtain emergency contraception in Ukraine, but supply chains have been disrupted and for women generally it's really important they can access this,"" she said. Many people are displaced across Ukraine, so it's hard for aid workers to know how many supplies are needed in which areas. Last week, Ukrainian troops made a plea for food and medicine for the city of Mariupol, which has been blocked off from humanitarian aid by Russian soldiers. The IPPF has been working with the United Nations Population Fund and International Medical Corps to bring supplies of the tablets into Ukraine. Ms Hickson said: ""The UN agencies, civil society organisations and the Ministry of Health have come together to identify the needs and they're transmitted to all of us working in support. ""We're then told which areas or hospitals need post-rape kits."" The UN includes emergency contraception in kits sent to women and girls involved in conflicts across the world. They've done the same in Ukraine, along with sending supplies for family planning and delivering babies. The BBC has uncovered evidence of Ukrainian women being raped by invading soldiers during the war in villages a few miles from Kyiv. Other media outlets have reported similar stories from the city of Bucha, north-west of Kyiv. "

Slava Borecki carved his 5m (16ft) x 12m (40ft) sculpture, A Message of Peace, as part of the annual SandWorld festival in Weymouth. It depicts the Russian invasion of Ukraine with a teddy bear crushed by a tank and a young girl hiding behind a wall. Mr Borecki said it was a ""plea for peace"". He added: ""Both sides will lose no matter what - due to the deaths and devastation caused by this war and all others before it."" The work was created over 10 days using 150 tonnes of sand. Co-founder of SandWorld, Mark Anderson, who first met Mr Borecki in 1998 during a sand sculpture festival in Moscow, said it was ""quite an immense piece"". ""It's probably the most powerful piece we've ever had - it comes straight from his heart,"" he added. ""I don't think you can get any more meaningful - it's amazing."" Although Mr Borecki currently lives in Poznan, Poland, his hometown, which is 62 miles (100km) from Kyiv, has been bombed by Russian forces and schools, military bases and roads have been destroyed. Following the invasion, he opened his Polish home to 19 Ukrainian refugees. The festival is also raising money for aid agencies working in Ukraine.

458,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-61249158,2022-04-29T05:00:06,A Ukrainian father's terrifying journey to a Russian prison and back," Nikita Horban was sitting cross-legged on an old-fashioned steel hospital bed, running his fingers over the flat part of the bandage where his toes used to be. He was still wearing the clothes the Russians sent him home in - a military green t-shirt and tracksuit bottoms. He looked pale and gaunt, older than 31. ""I have lost a lot of weight,"" he said, looking down. ""I don't look good."" He shifted position on the bed. It had been about two weeks since he'd been able to stand, and he had to move his legs regularly to stop them aching. It was a bright spring day in Zaporizhzhia, in the south of Ukraine, but the Russians were running bombing raids in the region and the windows in the hospital were blacked out. The air on the ward was hot and stale. Nikita had been handed back to Ukraine just three days earlier, as part of a prisoner exchange, and brought to this hospital with another man. They had spent three grim weeks in a prison in Russia. The other man, Serhiy Vasylyha, 28, was returned with both feet amputated. ""He was not as lucky as me,"" Nikita said. The prisoner swaps are being negotiated by Ukraine's deputy prime minister, Iryna Vereshchuk, who confirmed that Nikita had been sent back from Russia. ""There were badly injured people in this exchange - amputated limbs, sepsis, other severe injuries,"" Vereshchuk told me. ""There were clear signs of torture,"" she said. ""The stories they told us are terrible."" Nikita's ordeal began in early March when the Russian army rolled into Andriivka, a small village west of Kyiv. Nikita, a lab assistant at a Kyiv hospital, was hiding in a cold, damp cellar under the garden with his father Sasha, their wives, and Nikita's five-year-old son. Sasha was Nikita's stepfather but the distinction had long faded. They called each other father and son. The Russians were going house to house, and they pulled the two men out of the cellar and beat them, Nikita said. ""There was shooting, people in the village were being killed, it was terrifying."" They were blindfolded and taken at gunpoint to what seemed like a field, where they were tortured. Nikita has a fresh scar on his knuckle, which he said was caused by the Russians tightening a wrench around the knuckle and turning it until the skin tore open. He could hear others around him, but he didn't know how many or who. ""All I can remember thinking is where is my father? What if he is not with me anymore?"" The Russians took away their boots, filled them with water and put them back on. Then the prisoners were forced to lie face down on the field in the freezing cold. ""We lay like that for three or four nights, under the rain, getting colder and colder,"" Nikita said. When he could no longer hear the Russians nearby, Nikita called out quietly, ""Dad are you there?"" And Sasha's voice came quietly back. They were together. From that point, they would keep talking whenever it seemed safe, reassuring each other they were close. As they lay in the field, a deep cold set into Nikita's feet. Soon he could not feel them at all. Then shells started falling close to them, announcing themselves with earth-shaking booms. ""We lay for a long time like that on the ground, saying goodbye to our lives over and over again,"" Nikita said. Eventually, they were hauled up from the ground and loaded onto trucks. Blindfolded, Nikita struggled to gauge how much time was passing. At some point, they were combined with another group of prisoners and loaded onto helicopters. Hunger was setting in - they had only been given one bowl of porridge, a piece of bread and a biscuit since they were taken, Nikita said. From the helicopters they were transferred onto a cargo plane. Nikita felt the engines revving and the plane speeding down the runway and taking off. He guessed he was with about 10 or 12 other prisoners. ""Are you OK?"" he said aloud, over the sound of the engines. ""Yes, I'm OK,"" Sasha replied. Back in the village, Nikita and Sasha's wives, Nadia and Svitlana, and Nikita's son Artem had moved from their cellar to a bigger shelter under the neighbour's house. They had no idea where their husbands were. A few houses over, Sasha's parents, Nadia and Volodymyr, were also beginning to worry. Sasha had stopped answering their calls, but it was impossible to venture out of the house to find out if he was safe. Shells were raining down around the village, and during pauses in the bombardment Russian soldiers would ransack houses. For more than a month, during the occupation, no family group would know if any other was alive. At some point, Nikita and Sasha crossed into Russian airspace, and the cargo plane began to descend. They were taken to a detention camp where their blindfolds were finally removed and they saw each other. They embraced. The Russians had also used the wrench on Sasha's knuckle, Nikita said, but worse, and one of his fingers was hanging by a small amount of tissue and skin. He was taken to a field hospital for treatment. With the blindfold off, Nikita could finally see his feet. His toes had turned black. He knew he was getting severe frostbite from the cold and he asked for medical attention. At the field hospital, they dried and bandaged his toes but that was it. They put his boots back on and after five days in the camp the prisoners were transported by truck to the Pre-Trial Detention Centre Number 1 - a prison in the Russian city of Kursk. The new inmates were put in uniforms and had their hair cut and were told they would be ""vaccinated"", which turned out to be a euphemism for a beating, Nikita said. By the time he and Sasha were locked in a cell with 10 others, Nikita was becoming convinced he could lose both his legs. ""That first night I realised I could neither feel nor control my feet at all,"" he recalled. ""And they had started to smell awful."" Others were facing the same grim situation. Some would later lose entire limbs. The care at the prison was minimal - an antibiotic shot and bandage changes once every three days. According to Nikita, the prison doctor told him: ""We have good medicine and medical treatment here, but it is not for you."" The prisoners kept each other entertained in the cell by talking about their families and telling jokes. They were forced to learn patriotic Russian songs by heart and perform them for the guards, Nikita said. ""The anthem of Russia, another disgusting Putin-glorifying song. They gave them to us in the morning and told us to learn them by lunchtime,"" he said. They were interrogated two or three times a day and beaten, he said. Afterwards they were forced to sign documents declaring they had been treated and fed well and not harmed, which is how they learned where they were, because the documents were stamped ""Kursk Pre-Trial Detention Centre 1"". After three weeks in the prison, the condition of Nikita's feet had worsened dramatically, and he was finally transferred to hospital with two others. A surgeon told him he was going to have all his toes amputated. ""They were in such bad condition by then that during the examination one of my toes just fell off,"" Nikita said. He spent a week in the hospital after his surgery, before an official there told him that he and several other badly wounded men would be sent home ""to be taken care of by your families instead"". Vereshchuk, the deputy prime minister, told me the Russians had tried to exchange civilian hostages for Russian military prisoners in Ukraine - a move forbidden by the Geneva Convention. ""That's why they captured all these hostages - civilians, women, employees of local councils, to try and use them,"" she said. ""We know there are more than a thousand hostages there - including almost 500 women. We know they are in prisons and pre-trial detention centres in Kursk, in Briansk, in Riazan, in Rostov."" Nikita was never taken back to the prison in Kursk, where he had last seen Sasha. From the hospital, he was loaded once again onto a cargo plane, this time to Simferopol in Crimea. The Russian authorities told Vereshchuk they had no ambulances spare, so gravely injured prisoners were put in the back of empty flatbed trucks for the five-hour drive to the exchange. At the meeting point, the Russians laid the wounded men on the highway on their stretchers and walked away, and Ukrainian soldiers came and picked them up. Nikita still didn't believe he was in Ukraine, he said, right up until the moment one of the soldiers looked him in the eyes and said in Ukrainian, ""Welcome back buddy."" ""I was in pieces,"" he said. ""I knew I was back in my homeland."" But he didn't know if his family was alive. He knew nothing of what had happened in Ukraine in the past month. Nikita gave a Ukrainian official the number for his wife Nadia and waited, his heart pounding in his chest. ""I was just waiting for the dialling sound, to know at least that her phone was alive,"" he said. ""Then it started dialling and she declined the call, and I knew she was alive."" On the second attempt, Nadia picked up. She told him she was in Belgium with Artem and they were safe. ""For five minutes we just cried into the phone,"" Nikita said. ""We tried to talk to each other but we couldn't. There were tears running down my cheeks. I just heard her say hello and I couldn't take a breath."" Nadia called Sasha's brother Vyacheslav, and his parents Nadia and Volodymyr, to let them know the news. But there was a big piece still missing. ""We know now that Sasha was alive when Nikita left but that was two weeks ago,"" his mother Nadia told me. ""So we are still here waiting and hoping. We are still not doing good."" Since his arrival in back in Ukraine, Nikita had been trying to arrange a transfer from Zaporizhzhia to the hospital in Kyiv where he worked. It appeared to be stalled. Then suddenly, early on Tuesday morning, a nurse came in to tell him he was going home. After a long ambulance journey across the country, Nikita was wheeled in to a hero's welcome from his colleagues at the Kyiv Civilian Hospital No 5. He was taken up to a private room with a large open window overlooking pine trees. About mid-morning on Wednesday, the chief of medicine and chief surgeon came to visit him. They had been waiting nervously for news of Nikita, and they were both brought to tears by his return. Two of their other colleagues, a married couple, had recently been killed with their children by a Russian shell. ""It means everything to us to have him back,"" said the surgeon, Yuriy Shylenko. ""He will need to relearn to walk, but we are going to do everything for him."" Nikita put on a pair of hospital slippers and showed off his progress by standing and taking a few steps. The doctors were talking through his recovery plans. But he wasn't really listening. ""I have only one thing on my mind,"" he said, after they'd left. ""Going to my wife and son.""

459,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-61266186,2022-04-29T05:00:03,Ukraine war: Professor tells of elderly mother's death in Mariupol," A Ukrainian professor at the University of Cambridge has told how his mother was found dead by a neighbour in the besieged city of Mariupol. Andrei Kirilenko said the neighbour could not bury his 85-year-old mother Svetlana due to the danger from Russian shelling. He had not been able to speak to her since early March. He believes she died on 11 March. The last time the two spoke, he said, they had been ""saying goodbye"". Prof Kirilenko told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the neighbour had told him her son had found Mrs Kirilenko in her home not breathing on 11 March. Because of the shelling, it was too dangerous for the neighbour to bury her, so he took her body into a cold garage, so that it would be preserved for longer. He does not know what happened after that. The key port city of Mariupol, in the eastern Donbas region, has been encircled by Russian troops and has seen intense fighting for weeks. While some efforts to evacuate civilians were successful, several failed and large parts of the city have been destroyed. ""They [the neighbours] had to escape just as soon as they could,"" Prof Kirilenko said. The last time he spoke to his mother he said she was ""saying goodbye"". ""She was talking a bit about her past and was also asking a bit about my son, her grandson, who is college-bound, so she was thinking a bit about her past but also about the future."" Mrs Kirilenko had a tough life. As the eldest of three children, with her father called away to war and her mother working, it had fallen to her to care for her younger siblings. She survived the Nazi occupation of her town during World War Two and her father being sent to a concentration camp after the war. Prof Kirilenko said his mother had been proud of him and her grandson - and was glad to see them flourishing. ""So many generations before me could not realise their talents and ambitions that she was happy to see it finally come out."" He said she had always valued freedom and being able to speak freely, having grown up under communist rule. ""She grew up not being able to express herself and she said freedom is somehow undervalued but it is truly the most important thing out there,"" he added. Even before the current Russian invasion, war was not far away from her, as fighting has been taking place in the eastern Donbas region since 2014. Prof Kirilenko said: ""She lived very close to the edge of the city and she could hear shelling pretty much every day. There were soldiers dying on both sides, there were casualties every day on both the Russian and Ukrainian side, certainly the Ukrainian side."" Since then, he said he stopped speaking to her in Russian, using Ukrainian instead, but she had continued to speak Russian to him. ""The reason I switched was because I felt Russians have weaponised their language, and speaking Russian. especially that close to the front lines. was like an invitation to invade,"" he said. ""But she made her choice, she continued speaking Russian, she lived in that city because she felt that's where she belongs, that's where her roots are, that's her city."" Reflecting on his mother's life Mr Kirilenko said that for many in her generation ""survival was probably how they approached life - not happiness"". Asked how he'd like people to honour her life he said: ""If you feel like you want to have an argument don't do that, if you felt for a while that you wanted to say something nice to someone - today's a good day. ""If you feel you can improve something for someone, one person at a time, today's a good day."" "

Antonio Guterres said the council had failed to prevent or end the war in Ukraine. This was ""a source of great disappointment, frustration and anger,"" he said. ""Let me be very clear: [it] failed to do everything in its power to prevent and end this war,"" he added. The 15-member UN Security Council is specifically tasked with ensuring global peace and security. But it has faced criticism, including from Ukraine's government, for failing to act since the invasion began in February. Russia is one of five permanent members of the body and it has vetoed more than one resolution on the conflict. Mr Guterres was speaking on Thursday evening at a joint news conference with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who has previously criticised the Security Council. ""I am here to say to you Mr President, and to the people of Ukraine, we will not give up,"" he said. But Mr Guterres also defended his organisation, admitting that while the Security Council had been ""paralysed"" the UN was taking other actions. ""The UN is the 1,400 staff members in Ukraine who are working to provide assistance, food, cash [and] other forms of support,"" he told the BBC. At Thursday's briefing, President Zelensky said Mr Guterres had a chance to witness first-hand ""all the war crimes"" committed by Russia in Ukraine. The Ukrainian leader again described Russia's actions in his country as ""genocide"". During the UN chief's visit, two blasts hit the central Shevchenko district of Kyiv, with three people taken to hospital with injuries, according to the city's mayor. Mr Guterres also visited several sites where Ukraine accuses Russia of committing war crimes. Moscow denies the accusation. In the town of Borodyanka, north-west of Kyiv, Mr Guterres spoke to reporters in front of buildings that had been destroyed by strikes and shelling. He said the site made him imagine what it would be like for his own family, calling the war in Ukraine an ""absurdity in the 21st Century."" And Mr Guterres made a passionate plea to save thousands of people in Ukraine's southern city of Mariupol, which has been virtually destroyed by weeks of heavy Russian bombardment. ""Mariupol is a crisis within a crisis,"" he said. ""Thousands of civilians need life-saving assistance, many are elderly and in need of medical care, or have limited mobility. They need an escape route out of the apocalypse."" Russia has so far denied repeated requests by Kyiv to allow the last Ukrainian defenders and civilians trapped in the Azovstal industrial area to be evacuated. But Mr Guterres later told the BBC that Russia's President Vladimir Putin had agreed ""in principle"" to allow civilians to evacuate the city. Previous evacuation attempts have stalled and local officials have blamed Russian shelling. "

But something rather odd has appeared in the centre of St Petersburg. A bizarre art installation made up of one word: ""ZAMESTIM"" (""We will replace""). Each letter is the first letter of an international brand that has suspended operations in Russia. Their company logos are featured, too. Z is for Zara. A is for Adidas. M means McDonald's… Hundreds of international companies have pulled out of Russia in protest at the Kremlin's offensive in Ukraine. Officials here have been trying to sound upbeat, claiming that Russia will find local replacements for foreign items no longer available. But the disappearance of global products and services adds to Russia's growing sense of international isolation. Do Russians care? Many here claim not to. Russia says it is no longer supplying gas to Poland and Bulgaria after the countries refused to pay for their supplies in roubles - a move the EU considers to be a form of blackmail. Despite the invasion of Ukraine, Russia has continued to supply a large amount of gas to many European countries. However, after Western powers placed financial sanctions on Russia, President Vladimir Putin announced that ""unfriendly"" countries would have to pay for gas in the Russian currency. Payments in roubles would shore up the Russian currency and benefit its economy. EU Commission president Ursula von der Leyen warned that complying with Russian demands would breach EU sanctions and would be ""high risk"" for companies that did so. Nevertheless, Uniper, one of Germany's biggest energy firms, has said it is preparing to buy Russian gas using a payment system that critics say will undermine EU sanctions. Who's paying in roubles and how much gas does Russia supply to Europe? Three weeks since his release, Volodymyr Khropun still looks visibly shaken by the trauma he's endured. A Red Cross volunteer, he was captured by Russian forces, and deported to Russia. On 18 March, Volodymyr was driving a school bus to the village of Kozarovychi, about 40km (25 miles) north-west of Kyiv, to evacuate a few civilians who were stuck there amid the fighting. When he tried to convince Russian soldiers to let him pass their checkpoint, they detained him. For the first few days he was kept in the basement of a factory of a village nearby, along with other civilians, 40 people in a 28 sq m (300 sq ft) room. ""We were beaten with rifles, punched, and kicked. They blindfolded me and tied my hands with duct tape. They used Tasers and kept asking for information about the military,"" Volodymyr said. After being held for nearly a week in Ukraine, they were transported to Belarus, and then to a prison in Russia, where Volodymyr says he was tortured. ""They humiliated us. They treated us like animals."" "

But something rather odd has appeared in the centre of St Petersburg. A bizarre art installation made up of one word: ""ZAMESTIM"" (""We will replace""). Each letter is the first letter of an international brand that has suspended operations in Russia. Their company logos are featured, too. Z is for Zara. A is for Adidas. M means McDonald's… Hundreds of international companies have pulled out of Russia in protest at the Kremlin's offensive in Ukraine. Officials here have been trying to sound upbeat, claiming that Russia will find local replacements for foreign items no longer available. But the disappearance of global products and services adds to Russia's growing sense of international isolation. That seems a strange thing to be saying in St Petersburg. After all, Emperor Peter the Great designed and built this city to make Russia feel like a part of Europe. Out of marshland he created a breathtakingly beautiful Russian Amsterdam or Venice, with myriad canals and stunning palaces. With the help of European artists and architects rose an imperial capital with a European face. Yet three centuries on, the gulf between Russia and Europe grows wider by the day. Do Russians care? Many here claim not to. ""Russia's not Europe. Russia is Russia,"" says Lubov, who has stopped to chat to me by the ""ZAMESTIM"" art installation. Lubov tells me she doesn't follow what's happening in Ukraine. ""It's an unpleasant news story,"" she says. ""So, I try not to watch TV. So that I don't get upset."" My next conversation next to ""ZAMESTIM"" is with Raisa. She gets all her news from Russian TV. ""The Ukrainians are to blame for the violence,"" Raisa says. ""They're ganging up on us. Those nationalists are deploying weapons on our border. How certain are you that what Russian TV is telling you is the truth?"" I ask. ""Knowing the Russian people like I do, I'm 100% sure."" How many Raisas are there in Russia? What percentage of the Russian public support what President Putin calls his ""Special Military Operation"" in Ukraine? More than 80%, according to recent surveys. I'm sceptical. In an authoritarian country like Russia, the accuracy of public opinion polling is questionable. Fear skews results. Over the past two months, most of the Russians we have approached on the streets for interview have declined to speak about Ukraine, preferring to keep their opinions to themselves. Of those who did express views on the record, many repeated almost word for word what state TV has been telling them, reproducing the parallel reality created by the Kremlin. They speak of Russian troops ""liberating Ukraine"" and ""fighting Nazism in Ukraine."" But when I take a stroll through the historic centre of St Petersburg, I discover a very different picture. Among the city's famous courtyards, I find plenty of anti-war graffiti. In some cases, anti-Putin slogans, too, have been scrawled on walls. There are other forms of protest. Earlier this month St Petersburg artist Sasha Skochilenko was arrested and charged with spreading fake news about the Russian armed forces. She is accused of replacing price tags in a supermarket with anti-war messages. Sasha is being held in pre-trial detention. ""This shows that free speech in our country is being stamped out,"" Sasha Skochilenko's partner, Sonia Subbotina, tells me. ""It shows that political repression is getting worse and that people with anti-war views are being persecuted and put in prison."" ""There was protest activity in Russia. People were coming out to protest. But each protest is a major risk. You can be arrested, you can be beaten, you can be put in jail. Right now I feel completely lost. I don't know if anything can be done."" Those in power in Russia are demanding unflinching support from the Russian people: for the direction in which the Kremlin is taking Russia, away from Europe; for the anti-Western rhetoric emanating from Moscow; and for Russia's military offensive in Ukraine - no matter what the consequences here at home.

Mr Biden said it was ""critical"" for US lawmakers to approve the deal, which he said would help Ukraine defend itself. The proposal includes more than $20bn in military aid, $8.5bn in economic aid and $3bn in humanitarian aid. ""It's not cheap,"" Mr Biden said on Thursday. ""But caving to aggression is going to be more costly if we allow it to happen."" Although the US has already announced help for Ukraine, the proposals are a significant ramping up of aid. President Biden said US military support to Ukraine has so far amounted to 10 anti-tank weapons for every tank that Russia has deployed to Ukraine. But despite his strong rhetoric, he said the US was not attacking Russia. ""We are helping Ukraine defend itself against Russian aggression,"" he insisted. On Thursday, a spokesperson for Russia's Foreign Ministry said Western military support for Ukraine threatens ""the security of the continent"". President Biden is asking Congress to authorise an enormous sum of money for Ukraine - more than twice as much as the US has already spent on providing military equipment and humanitarian aid. The US president wants to show he is undeterred by vague threats about the possible use of nuclear weapons, and a warning from Vladimir Putin that there could be retaliatory strikes against countries that intervene in Ukraine. He shrugged off those comments - saying they show the desperation Russia is feeling about their abject failure to do what they set out to do. Explaining to Americans why this money is needed - at a time when many are suffering from rising living costs - he said it was not cheap, but doing nothing was more costly. An additional plan to allow US authorities to not just freeze but liquidate the assets of Russian oligarchs is bold - and it has raised concerns among civil liberties groups in America. But it is likely to gain bipartisan support in Congress. Yet it will not begin to cover cost of the additional sums of money the White House wants to spend supporting Ukraine's war efforts. In his speech on Thursday, Mr Biden also addressed concerns over a nuclear confrontation. On Wednesday, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov warned of a ""serious"" risk of nuclear war over Ukraine which ""can't be underestimated"". ""No one should be making idle comments about the use of nuclear weapons,"" Mr Biden said. Additionally, Mr Biden took aim at what he termed Russian ""gas blackmail"" to threaten European energy supplies. This week, Russia cut off gas supplies to Poland and Bulgaria. ""We will not let Russia intimidate or blackmail their way out of these sanctions,"" he said. ""We will not allow them to use their oil and gas to avoid consequences for their aggression."" The announcement of the new Ukraine package comes at a difficult time for the US economy. Data released by the Bureau of Economic Analysis on Thursday shows that the US economy shrank in the first quarter of 2022, with gross domestic product declining 1.4% between January and March. But the package is likely to be approved by lawmakers, said BBC North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher. ""At a time when Biden is struggling to get congressional funding for his domestic priorities, Congress seems to have an unlimited willingness to bankroll military support for Ukraine,"" he said. ""Thirty-three billion is a significant amount, but if the past is any guide it should be approved with relative ease - as long as Democrats don't try to attach unrelated spending provisions to the legislation."" Mr Biden's first funding request after the war began, which was approved by Congress last month, was less than $14bn. Last week, President Biden authorised a second $800m (£642m) military aid package in as many weeks, as well as $500m (£401m) in direct economic assistance. The US has moved quickly to help Ukraine since the war began in late February. That includes: The White House on Thursday also proposed making it easier for the US to seize and sell Russian oligarchs' assets, and transfer their proceeds to Ukraine. Western allies, including European Union member states, have been working together since March to track down the assets of Russian elites, from artwork and real estate to helicopters and yachts. According to the White House, the US has now sanctioned and blocked vessels and aircraft worth over $1bn, while the EU has collectively frozen over $30bn. Thursday's sanctions would allow the US to use the funds from confiscated assets ""to remediate harms of Russian aggression in Ukraine"". The package will ""establish new authorities for the forfeiture of property linked to Russian kleptocracy, allow the government to use the proceeds to support Ukraine and further strengthen related law enforcement tools,"" the White House said in a statement. Canada's government also proposed legislation this week that would allow it to seize and sell off Russian assets. Under pressure to expand its sanctions actions, the ruling Liberals are pushing for ""any type of property"" including money, digital assets and virtual currency to be subject to seizure. "

Sources in Ukraine told the BBC the dead man is Scott Sibley, who is understood to have been fighting for Ukrainian forces. He is the first British national confirmed to have been killed in the conflict and has been described as a ""friend like no other"". The Foreign Office has not released the identity of either person. But a spokesman said it was supporting both their families. Details of Mr Sibley's death and how or when the second person went missing have not been given. Diplomatic sources have said it was most likely the two individuals were foreign volunteers serving with Ukrainian armed forces in either Mariupol or elsewhere in Donbas. Tributes have been paid online to Mr Sibley, who is understood to be a former member of British armed forces, including on Facebook and on fundraising pages set up in his memory. A post on the Logistics Support Squadron Facebook page described him as a ""former serving soldier"" of the squadron and said he had ""showed Commando spirit until the end"". The founder of a fundraising page described Mr Sibley, also known as Sibs, as a ""friend like no other"" and ""the bravest person I've had the pleasure to have known"". ""His life may have been cut short but he lived to the full and did things the Sibs way, right until the end,"" he wrote. The Foreign Office spokesman said it was ""urgently seeking further information"" on the missing British national. Three former members of UK special forces were reportedly killed in March during a Russian missile attack on a military training centre near the border with Poland - but this was never confirmed. The government urged British nationals to leave Ukraine in February and has told people not to travel to the country since Russia invaded. In the early days of the war Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said she supported individuals from the UK who might want to go to Ukraine to fight but the government has since advised against this. Hundreds of former British soldiers have said they wanted to go to Ukraine to fight or help with humanitarian efforts, while others without a military background have travelled to offer support to the Ukrainians. The authorities in Ukraine have estimated that at least 20,000 people have come from overseas to join the fight against Russia, although not all of those will be British. Two British men who were fighting with Ukrainian forces have already been captured by Russian troops. Aiden Aslin and Shaun Pinner, who had both lived in Ukraine since 2018, were taken captive while defending the south-eastern city of Mariupol earlier this month. "
470,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-61257846,2022-04-28T16:50:11,German energy firm Uniper ready to meet Russian pay demand," One of Germany's biggest energy firms has said it is preparing to buy Russian gas using a payment system that critics say will undermine EU sanctions. Uniper says it will pay in euros which will be converted into roubles, meeting a Kremlin demand for all transactions to be made in the Russian currency. Other European energy firms are reportedly preparing to do the same amid concerns about supply cuts. Uniper said it had no choice but said it was still abiding by EU sanctions. ""We consider a payment conversion compliant with sanctions law and the Russian decree to be possible,"" a spokesman told the BBC. ""For our company and for Germany as a whole, it is not possible to do without Russian gas in the short term; this would have dramatic consequences for our economy."" Germany's biggest energy supplier RWE declined to comment on how it would pay for Russian gas. In late March, Russia said ""unfriendly countries"" would have to start paying for its oil and gas in roubles to prop up its currency after Western allies froze billions of dollars it held in foreign currencies overseas. Under the decree, European importers must pay euros or dollars into an account at Gazprombank, the Swiss-based trading arm of Gazprom, and then convert this into roubles in a second account in Russia. The European Commission said last week that if buyers of Russian gas could complete payments in euros and get confirmation of this before any conversion into roubles took place, that would not breach sanctions. However there are different views among countries on how to interpret its initial guidance, and this week EC boss Ursula von der Leyen sparked confusion when she said firms could still be breaking the rules. On Thursday, an EU official confirmed that any attempt to convert cash into roubles in Russia would be a ""clear circumvention of sanctions"" as the transaction would involve Russia's central bank. ""What we cannot accept is that companies are obliged to open a second account and that between the first and second account, the amount in euros is in the full hands of the Russian authorities and the Russian Central Bank, and that the payment is only complete when it is converted into roubles."" On Tuesday, Poland and Bulgaria both refused to pay for gas in roubles leading to Russian state gas firm Gazprom shutting off supplies. Both countries had already planned not to renew their contracts with Gazprom when they expired later in 2022. Poland - one of the staunchest advocates of tougher sanctions on Russia - said the EU should penalise countries that used roubles to pay for Russian gas. Climate minister Anna Moskwa singled out Germany, Hungary and Austria as resisting a gas embargo. ""We are counting on there being consequences for these countries [which pay in roubles] and that as a result they will cease paying in roubles,"" she said. The move by Russia - which has not given countries the same deadline to begin paying in roubles - is seen as an attempt to divide Western allies in their response over Ukraine. The majority - 97% - of EU companies' gas supply contracts with Gazprom stipulate payment in euros or dollars. Hungary and Slovakia have both said they will use Russia's conversion payment method, while German economy minister Robert Habeck said on Wednesday that it was ""the path that the EU marked out for us"". ""It's the path that is compatible with sanctions, and as far as I understand the German companies that are doing it this way are in compliance with their contracts,"" he said. ""Most EU countries are taking this approach."" Europe gets about 40% of its natural gas from Russia, but it is much higher for some countries and sudden supply cuts could have a huge economic impact. ""A lot of European companies will say OK, we'll pay into a euro-denominated bank account and there will be a back-to-back trade so they stay within the limits of the EU sanctions,"" said Nathan Piper, an energy analyst at Investec. ""But there are two sides of this - those firms need to supply gas to consumers and in Germany there is no alternative to supplies of Russian gas right now."" According to the Financial Times, Austrian energy giant OMV is also planning to adopt the mechanism while Italy's Eni is considering the move. Eni declined to comment while OMV denied it was opening a Swiss account with Gazprom. It told the BBC: ""We have analysed the Gazprom request about payment methods in light of the EU-sanctions and are now working on a sanctions-compliant solution."" "

472,https://www.bbc.com/news/61187310,2022-04-28T14:57:51,Mariupol: Videos appear to show dead civilians," Video footage has emerged from the city of Mariupol in Ukraine showing the bodies of more than 20 civilians lying along a main road. The graphic videos, posted on social media in recent days, come as the United Nations has confirmed that it is investigating hundreds of allegations of killing of civilians during the invasion of Ukraine. The southern port city of Mariupol has been the scene of weeks of intense fighting between Russian and Ukrainian forces. We've been examining these latest videos for clues about what might have happened. Warning: This piece contains graphic images and details which some may find upsetting. There are four videos showing bodies lying along a section of road in Mariupol. In one video, we counted 18 bodies - all appear to be wearing civilian clothing and there are no weapons visible. One body is lying next to a bag of shopping at a bus stop, another next to a damaged car. Looking at all four videos, we counted 23 bodies in total. The videos also show damage to buildings, knocked down power cables and debris on the road. Civilians can also be seen walking past the bodies. The videos are all filmed near the Ilyich Iron and Steel Works in northern Mariupol - the BBC has confirmed the locations. The bodies are lying along Boika Avenue, which is next to the plant. The BBC has matched buildings, road markings, bus stops and other visual clues seen in the videos, to satellite and street view images of the road. For example, in one of the videos, a body is lying in front of a lamp post and a section of distinctive metal fencing, behind which is a white wall and part of the steel plant. It matches the same location seen on Yandex street view. News agency photographs of some of the bodies can also be matched to the scene. One is filmed by Patrick Lancaster, a former US navy intelligence veteran who has been posting videos from Russian-controlled areas in eastern Ukraine on his social accounts since 2014. Mr Lancaster has frequently appeared as a guest on Russian state TV, as well as US conspiracy website InfoWars. Another video is filmed by Italian journalist Vittorio Nicola Rangeloni. Mr Rangeloni, who lives in the eastern Donbas region of Ukraine, began posting videos from Mariupol in late March. The third and fourth videos were uploaded by Russian agency ANNA News and the pro-Kremlin Telegram channel, Signal. It is not clear when the videos were filmed. However, we found that the earliest one online was the ANNA News report, which was uploaded on 15 April. The earliest appearance of two of the remaining videos could be traced to 18 April and 19 April respectively. According to the Institute for the Study of War (ISW), Ukrainian forces had been in control of the area where the videos were filmed until 28 March. It says Russian forces claimed control of this area on 7 April but it also notes that the Russian Ministry of Defence claimed that hundreds of Ukrainian marines surrendered at the Ilyich metal plant on 13 April. A satellite image from the US firm Maxar on 11 April does not appear to show any bodies on the street at that point. And cloud cover in the area in images they provided for the period from 13 to 19 April means it's not possible to see the street clearly. Several passers-by interviewed in the videos said they were told the victims were killed by a Ukrainian sniper, targeting people passing along the road. In the video filmed by Mr Rangeloni, one man says: ""I'm in shock, I'm shocked. They say a sniper was sitting there, people were going to get their work documents and he was shooting them."" Another man, asked by the journalist if there was a Ukrainian sniper, replies that the Ukrainians were in the ""factory"" at that time - referring to the steelworks alongside the road. However, neither of them says they witnessed any of the killings. The BBC has not been able to verify their claims, but has contacted the Ukrainian and Russian authorities for comment. The UN Human Rights Office in Ukraine told us that they cannot verify reports of killings by a Ukrainian sniper. In the video taken by Mr Lancaster, a man who is interviewed takes the opportunity to launch into a lengthy denunciation of the Ukrainian government, and praises President Putin. We used facial recognition analysis on the interviewees in the videos - using a computer algorithm to compare their images to a huge number of photos of people's faces - to see whether they had featured in other videos during the conflict but could not find any matches. We also approached Mr Rangeloni and Mr Lancaster for comment. Mr Lancaster said: ""Neither myself or that man [I interviewed] said who killed those people as that area was a huge hotbed of fighting"". We showed the videos to a former military sniper who wished to remain anonymous. He told us: ""The wounds are not consistent with sniper shots."" He said he would expect to see a lot more blood from shots to the head, referring to one victim whose face shows signs of injuries to an eye. We also contacted several pathologists. Working out how these people were killed, when and by whom, is further complicated by the fact that only a few of the bodies have their faces visible. Dr Victor Weedn, a forensic pathology consultant, said: ""The bodies scattered over the roadways near a factory appear to have all died about the same time. ""The image is of clothed bodies at a distance and does not allow a definitive determination of the cause of death, but it is suspected they were shot, probably in the head."" Dr Carl Wigren, a forensic pathologist, also concluded the victims had died at ""very near the same time"" but, again, could not be definitive about the cause of death. He noted the lack of blood around nearly all the bodies and said this and the ""lack of visible injuries in fully-clothed individuals makes me think that this was the result of possibly blunt force injury"" caused by the shock waves from explosions. He said, of one body - with a decomposed face - that although it appeared to have been there for several weeks, flesh missing from the face could have been the result of an animal scavenging. We will continue to investigate these videos and will update this article when we have more information.

473,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-61256615,2022-04-28T14:24:47,Coal plants asked to stay open longer due to energy supply fears," Energy firms have been asked to delay the closure of UK coal-fired power plants, by the government. The move follows concerns over possible disruption to Russian gas supplies to Europe due to the war in Ukraine. The government said it was exploring ""a wide range of options to further bolster our energy security and domestic supply"". The plants were due to close in the autumn as the UK moves towards more sustainable energy production. Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng wrote to EDF, Drax and Uniper this month to ask that they temporarily extend the operation of the coal plants, which are used for back-up generation. The UK gets very little of its power from coal, but generates a lot of electricity from gas. A government spokesperson said: ""In light of Russia's illegal invasion of Ukraine, it is right that we explore a wide range of options to further bolster our energy security and domestic supply. ""That's why we are exploring slightly extending the life of our remaining coal-fired power stations to provide additional back up electricity this coming winter if needed. ""It remains our firm commitment to end the use of coal power by October 2024."" The government is ""confident that electricity security will be maintained"". The energy suppliers would receive subsidies worth tens of millions of pounds, the Times reported, and those subsidies would be recouped from energy bills. French energy giant EDF, which has been asked to delay the full closure of its West Burton A plant in Nottinghamshire, said half of the plant started to be decommissioned in the summer of 2021, and the rest was ""available over the recent winter to supply electricity during peak times"". ""The plan is to start decommissioning the final two units at the start of October 2022, and many processes have already been put in place to achieve that, including reducing the site's staffing numbers and running down the coal stock,"" it said. ""EDF has recently been asked by the UK government to consider what it would take to make West Burton A available next winter and this remains under discussion."" The three energy firms are in discussions with the National Grid Electricity System Operator, which makes sure UK electricity supply meets demand, over the amount of subsidy that would be needed to keep that coal-fired capacity. EDF said it needed the Electricity System Operator ""to offer acceptable terms"" so it could invest in the plant, buy coal, and support operating costs. ""We would be available on a standby arrangement, like this last winter, supplying at peak periods only,"" a spokesperson said. Drax, which mothballed the coal-fired units at its North Yorkshire power station in 2021, said it still expected to close them completely in September 2022, ""but remains committed to supporting security of supply in the UK"". It said whether it would delay closing them ""remains under review"" and that it is ""looking carefully"" at options. Uniper, one of Germany's biggest energy firms, said the government had asked it to explore the possibility of keeping its unit at Ratcliffe power station, due to close in September 2022, open for longer. On Wednesday, Russia halted gas exports to Poland and Bulgaria after they refusal to pay for supplies in roubles. Russian President Vladimir Putin has ordered ""unfriendly"" countries to pay for gas in roubles as part of efforts to prop up the currency in the wake of Western sanctions over its invasion of Ukraine. The EU called the decision to halt Polish and Bulgarian supplies ""an instrument of blackmail"". "

The Woodhall Spa 1940s Festival, which features parades and re-enactors in period dress, attracts up to 45,000 to the Lincolnshire village each year. But concerns had been raised over whether it was appropriate this year. However, organisers have now said the event will take place and will raise funds to support Ukrainian refugees. People had previously been asked to share their views via an online survey about whether the 1940s Festival should take place in the village. Announcing the decision, a spokesperson for the festival committee said: ""We are pleased to confirm our 2022 festival will go ahead on 9-10 July as planned. ""After thoroughly examining the festival in light of the current conflict in Ukraine, our committee is confident to press on with planning and delivering this summer's event. ""We are also committed to using the festival to raise and donate funds to support Ukrainian refugees in our local area,"" the spokesperson added. But festival organiser Andy Hunter said there would be some changes to the format of the event compared to previous years. ""In the past, we've had some Russian re-enactors that have come to our festival, and of course they won't be coming this year. ""It's not been a big part of our festival, but we've had skirmishes and mock battles in the past and we won't be doing those this year either. ""As a committee, we remain very sensitive to the issues and will look at other things on a case-by-case basis,"" Mr Hunter said. The festival's organisers had also consulted as widely as possible, including with local businesses, residents and via the online survey, Mr Hunter added. ""We decided as a committee, quite rightly, to just take stock, to make sure we were heading in the right direction,"" he said. This year's event, billed as a celebration of the resilience of people on the home front in the 1940s, will be the first time the festival has been held since the start of the pandemic.

MP Hywel Williams dubbed the noise of the F-15s ""deafening"". He said the planes' flying schedules needed to be examined in light of the ""exceptional"" incident over Caernarfon, Gwynedd, on Friday. The US Air Force apologised for the disturbance. It said it was looking into what happened. Mr Williams has now written a letter to the Secretary of State for Defence Ben Wallace about the matter after receiving complaints. Branding the flights ""stunts"" he told the minister they cause noise, nuisance and fear and were not acceptable. ""Having welcomed a number of Ukrainian refugees to Arfon, I find it shocking that the Ministry of Defence would think such unscheduled and unnecessary flights would be acceptable in the current climate. ""Goodness knows what these already traumatised families must think."" Mr Williams said the planes were allowed to fly between 100 and 250ft. He told the BBC: ""They were coming over Caernarfon town centre, as far as I could see, or hear. ""It was deafening. ""That's what's different this time. They've gone over towns and villages, and obviously the circumstances are very difficult for those people who have fled to the area from Ukraine."" He believed the way low-flying training sessions are scheduled does not work. ""What I would like to know is what kind of coordination there is between the USA and the Ministry of Defence so they know they shouldn't fly low over towns? ""The arrangements don't work. This is an issue that crops up often, and I think it needs to be looked at."" The US Air Force confirmed the jets were from the 48th Fighter Wing, based at RAF Lakenheath in southern England. ""We are currently looking into the incident with regards to the timetable and schedule,"" it said. ""It is typical to conduct routine training, which is required for combat proficiency, and demonstrates our commitment to collective defence and cooperative security alongside the UK, and our other allies and partners in the region. ""While we take maximum care to avoid overpopulated areas to mitigate noise impacts, we apologise for the disturbance caused."" The MoD was approached for comment but said it was a matter for the US Air Force. "

The move comes after the Glasgow-based group announced a full suspension of its operations in Russia last month. It currently employs 267 sales and service staff there, the majority of whom work in its minerals division. The company said it expected the loss of sales in Russia to hit operating profits by up to £20m this year. At the beginning of March, the Scottish government urged businesses to stop all trading with Russia, following the start of the invasion on 24 February. Weir was among a number of Scottish companies which later announced they were pausing activities in the country. It continues to have about 30 employees based in Ukraine. In a trading update, Weir said that ""given the evolution of the situation"" it had taken the decision to wind down its Russian business during 2022. It stated: ""We strongly condemn the Russian military invasion of Ukraine. Our priority remains the welfare of our Ukraine-based colleagues and their families. ""We are deeply saddened by the humanitarian crisis that continues to unfold and have pledged financial support to organisations working to help the people of Ukraine. ""Our thoughts are with all those whose lives are being affected by these events and join with others in hoping for a swift and peaceful end to the hostilities."" Weir's Russian business represents about 2% of the group's net assets. In its trading update, the company stated: ""While a review of the recoverability remains ongoing, this could result in an exceptional write-off during 2022."" A year ago, Weir won a £36m order to supply energy-saving technology for an iron ore processing plant in Ukraine. It has already supplied some of the equipment, which includes high-pressure grinding rolls and screens. The rest is due to be delivered from 2023 onwards, depending on developments in Ukraine. Weir switched its focus to mining and infrastructure after selling its oil and gas division to Caterpillar in a £314m deal in 2020. "

Wheat, a key ingredient in chicken feed, has almost doubled in price because Russia and Ukraine produce about 30% of the global supply. Farmers are calling for a 40p increase in the cost of a dozen eggs to meet the rising costs. ""We're going to have a desperate egg shortage by Christmas if things don't change,"" said farmer David Sharples. Mr Sharples, who farms in Denbighshire, said rising feed cost meant there was little to no profit margin for farmers. ""We're really struggling, and we really do need a price increase of nigh on 40p per dozen eggs,"" he said. ""Our feed has really gone up in price nearly 50%, and feed constitutes about 60-70% of the egg production costs,"" said Mr Sharples, who owns Clyttir Farm in Llanbedr DC, Ruthin. He said UK retailers were giving nothing back to farmers, and the only thing they understood would be a ""food shortage"". ""We're just fighting and fighting, it's like going up against a brick wall that we're not getting anything back from,"" added Mr Sharples. ""The only thing that they understand is food shortage, that's the only thing they act upon, and we're trying to pre-empt that."" A spokesperson for Sainsbury's, the only large retailer to respond to the BBC's request for comment, said: ""We are in close contact with all our suppliers and understand that many are facing unprecedented cost challenges throughout their supply chains. ""We are working with our egg suppliers to make sure they receive a price that reflects the increasing costs they are facing. This is based on real time factors, such as the cost of feed."" Pembrokeshire farmer Gareth Curtis said the rising cost of producing the eggs had not been reflected by the price, leaving farmers to bear the brunt. ""The feed price has gone up, around 18 months ago it was around the £250 a tonne mark, but over the last six months or so it's gone up to around £400 a tonne,"" said Mr Curtis, who runs Pembrokeshire Farm Eggs, near Tenby, which keeps 64,000 free range chickens. ""The cost of feed is virtually what the eggs are being sold for, so there's virtually no margin in it whatsoever, some are almost at a loss. ""Every £10 the feed rises, the eggs have to go up a penny, and that hasn't happened. Nobody can sustain these sort of costs indefinitely, it needs to be passed on as soon as possible."" Andrew Joret, chairman of the British Egg Industry Council, said the ""skyrocketing"" price of chicken feed, along with rising energy costs, was having a ""really, really severe"" impact on farmers. Mr Joret said challenges during the Covid pandemic, followed by this winter's avian flu outbreak, had been compounded by war in Ukraine and a subsequent rise in feed price. He added that the purchase of day-old chicks decreased, which he has called ""majorly concerning"". ""This doesn't imply a shortage in eggs tomorrow, but it does imply the national flock will go down in the future, and that is a major concern. ""Producers need confidence that they are going to be able to produce and make money, and not lose money, or even go bankrupt which would be the worst case scenario. ""Even with a small cost increase eggs will still remain exceptionally good value. You can make a meal for a family with eggs, and it's much much cheaper than any other form of protein."" UK retailers Tesco, Asda, Morrisons, Aldi and Lidl have all been asked to comment. "

A Red Cross volunteer, he was captured by Russian forces, and deported to Russia. On 18 March, Volodymyr was driving a school bus to the village of Kozarovychi, about 40km (25 miles) north-west of Kyiv, to evacuate a few civilians who were stuck there amid the fighting. When he tried to convince Russian soldiers to let him pass their checkpoint, they detained him. For the first few days he was kept in the basement of a factory of a village nearby, along with other civilians, 40 people in a 28 sq m (300 sq ft) room. ""We were beaten with rifles, punched, and kicked. They blindfolded me and tied my hands with duct tape. They used Tasers and kept asking for information about the military,"" Volodymyr said. ""One of the soldiers was very young, almost a child. He used Tasers on people's necks, faces, knees. It's like he was having fun."" After being held for nearly a week in Ukraine, they were transported to Belarus. ""They thought we couldn't see, but I saw the villages we were passing, Ivankiv, Chernobyl and then I saw us crossing the border,"" he said. In Belarus, they were given an identity document. It says it is issued by the military of the Russian Federation and describes Volodymyr's place of birth as the ""Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic"". It is how Ukraine was known prior to the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991, before it became an independent country. It is a sign of Russia's ambitions in the region. From Belarus, Volodymyr says, they were taken to a prison in Russia. ""The torture continued. They humiliated us, made us kneel and forced us into uncomfortable positions. If we looked into their eyes, we were beaten. If we did something slowly we were beaten. They treated us like animals,"" he said. One evening Volodymyr counted 72 other people in detention with him. But he could hear there were more. ""We tried to support each other. Some days we couldn't believe this was all happening. It felt like we had been transported to the 16th Century from the 21st Century,"" he said. Two weeks into detention, on 7 April, Volodymyr was taken from prison. He and three female Ukrainian civilians from another detention centre were transported by air to Crimea, which was annexed by Russia from Ukraine in 2014. The women told Volodymyr they had also been beaten. They didn't understand where they were being taken to, but frequently heard the soldiers use the word ""exchange."" From Crimea they were taken by road to a point 32 km (20 miles) outside Zaporizhzhia, and allowed to walk across a bridge to Ukrainian-controlled territory. The exchange of military prisoners of war from both sides took place before Ukrainian civilians were allowed to walk over. It was 9 April. It had taken them two days to make the journey. Volodymyr struggles to describe how he felt, but he wants the world to hear his story. ""The fact that Ukrainian civilians are being held there [in Russia] is a 100% true."" In the prison, Volodymyr heard that people from the Chernobyl nuclear site were being held in a room next door. It is unclear who exactly the men in the prison were, but 169 Ukrainian National Guard responsible for securing Chernobyl are missing. They were first held in detention in the basement of the nuclear site for weeks when it was occupied by Russian troops. Valeriy Semonov, one of the engineers at Chernobyl, said that when Russian forces withdrew at the end of March, they took the guards along. In a village nearby lives the family of one of the missing men. Their identities are being hidden to protect them. On duty in Chernobyl, the serviceman had called his wife on the first day of the invasion, when the nuclear site was taken, to tell her to leave their village. She took her parents and their young son and went to the city of Lviv in western Ukraine. From 24 February to 9 March, she was able to talk to her husband on his mobile phone. ""He would not share much on the phone. He would just say, 'We're OK'. He would tell me to not worry about him,"" she said. ""Then they lost power, so we couldn't connect to his phone."" She still managed to talk to him a few more times over a landline phone at the site. ""The last time I spoke to my husband was on 31 March, on the day they were forcefully taken from Chernobyl. He told me, 'I'm OK physically, but emotionally it's very hard.' I could understand from his voice that he was very worried."" Her son asks about his father all the time. ""I tell him he's at work, but he's very scared. He's worried I will disappear too, and keeps following me around everywhere, to work, to the shops,"" she said. ""It's very tough for us. I just want Russia to release my husband."" Ukraine's interior ministry has told her he is being held in Russia. Married for six-and-a-half years, she said he was always there for her and that he loved his job. The BBC has spoken to the families of more than a dozen people who have been taken hostage by Russian troops. Only a few have returned. The majority are still missing, like Yuliia Payevska. Her husband Vadym told us she was captured by Russian forces on 14 March when she was working as a paramedic in Mariupol, helping evacuate injured soldiers and civilians. A propaganda video featuring her was carried by some pro-Kremlin Russian TV channels, which is how he found out she's in Russian captivity. He believes she has been taken to Russia. The Kremlin insists Ukrainian citizens are going to Russia willingly. ""I don't want to respond to these huge liars,"" said Iryna Venediktova, Ukraine's prosecutor general. ""There are at least 6,000 civilians who we can identify who have been deported, and from information in mass media in Russia, they say they have taken a million Ukrainians."" She said there have been instances of children being separated from their parents, and that almost everyone who has returned on a prisoner exchange has told them they were tortured and beaten. As the war rages in Ukraine's south and east, every day there are new reports of people being forcibly deported to Russia.

483,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-61240499,2022-04-27T23:54:14,"Ukraine War: Russia gas supply cuts 'blackmail', says EU"," Russia's decision to cut off gas exports to Poland and Bulgaria is an ""instrument of blackmail"", the EU says. European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen said the move showed Russia's ""unreliability"" as a supplier. But the Kremlin said Russia had been forced into the action by the ""unfriendly steps"" of Western nations. Europe depends on Russia for more than a third of its gas needs and state energy giant Gazprom holds a monopoly on pipeline supplies in Russia. While many European countries have taken steps to wean themselves of Russian oil imports since it invaded Ukraine, Russia has continued to supply large amount of gas to many European countries. After Western powers placed financial sanctions on Russia in response to its invasion, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced that ""unfriendly"" countries would have to pay for gas in Russian currency. Gazprom said this was why it had suspended supply to Bulgaria and Poland. Poland said the move was in retaliation for Polish sanctions against Russian individuals and firms. Poland has also been a key transit country for weapons to Ukraine. Bulgaria has historically had warm relations with Russia, but a new government took office last year which has denounced the invasion. President Putin meanwhile warned that if Western forces intervene in Ukraine, they will face a ""lightning-fast"" military response. In what is seen as a reference to ballistic missiles and nuclear arms, he told lawmakers in Moscow: ""We have all the tools no-one can boast of... we will use them if necessary."" But there are signs that Russia's offensive in Ukraine is not going as smoothly as planned, with one official saying Russian forces are having difficulties overcoming a ""staunch Ukrainian resistance"" in their offensive in the east of the country. In reaction to Gazprom's statement regarding the suspension of gas supplies to Poland and Bulgaria, Polish state gas company PGNiG confirmed that Gazprom's supplies to the country had been halted and warned that it reserved ""the right to seek compensation"". Polish President Andrzej Duda said ""appropriate legal steps"" will be taken against Gazprom, while his deputy foreign minister, Marcin Przydacz, told the BBC that Russia was seeking to ""foster divisions"" between Western allies. Bulgarian Prime Minister Kiril Petkov said the country was reviewing all of its contracts with Gazprom, including for transit of Russian gas to Serbia and Hungary, emphasising that ""one-sided blackmail was not acceptable"". Bulgaria, which relies on Gazprom for more than 90% of its gas supply, said overnight it had taken steps to find alternative sources but no restrictions on gas consumption were currently required for Bulgarians. Ms von der Leyen, speaking in Brussels, said Gazprom's move was ""unjustified and unacceptable,"" but emphasised that the bloc was ""prepared for this scenario"". She added that the EU, along with its international partners, will implement an ""immediate, united and coordinated"" response. The EU leader also hit out against reports carried by the media outlet Bloomberg which alleged 10 European energy companies are preparing to make payments for Gazprom gas in roubles, and that four energy companies have done so already. She said such moves would be ""high risk"" for the corporations and would constitute ""a breach of our sanctions"". ""Our guidance here is very clear,"" Ms von der Leyen said. While the EU has been firm that it will not comply with Mr Putin's demands that payments be made in roubles, Hungary has reached a workaround deal with Gazprom. The countries will pay into a euro-denominated account with Gazprombank, a subsidiary of the energy giant, which in turn will deposit the amount in roubles. Russia has refused to say how many other countries have agreed to make payments in this way. "

""We have all the tools no-one can boast of... we will use them if necessary"", he said, in what is seen as a reference to ballistic missiles and nuclear arms. Ukraine's allies have stepped up the supply of weapons, with the US vowing to make sure Ukraine defeats Russia. Western officials say Russia is being hampered in its efforts in the east. Last week, Russia launched a major offensive to seize the Donbas region after withdrawing from areas around the capital Kyiv. But according to one official, Russian forces are ""finding it difficult to overcome the staunch Ukrainian resistance and they are suffering losses"". In another development, the European Commission has accused Russia of blackmail after Moscow cut off gas exports to Poland and Bulgaria. The Commission's President, Ursula von der Leyen said it showed Russia's ""unreliability"" as a supplier. The Kremlin said Russia had been forced into the action by the ""unfriendly steps"" of Western nations. Gazprom's cut-off follows Poland and Bulgaria's refusal to pay for gas in Russian roubles - a demand made by President Vladimir Putin in March, which was designed to shore up the faltering currency battered by Western sanctions. Mr Putin made his comments speaking to Russian lawmakers in the northern city of St Petersburg on Wednesday. ""If someone from the outside tries to intervene in Ukraine and create strategic threats for Russia, our response will be lightning fast,"" he said. ""We have all the tools [to respond] that no one can boast of. And we will not be bragging about them, we will use them if necessary."" The Russian leader added that all decisions on what that response would include had already been made - without providing any further details. Russia invaded Ukraine on 24 February, and within days President Putin ordered his military to put Russia's nuclear deterrence forces on high alert. Analysts suggest such threats are an attempt by Mr Putin to warn Ukraine's allies not to intervene more in the conflict. President Putin was speaking a day after Western nations held a summit in Germany, promising to ramp up military support for Ukraine. US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin pledged to move ""heaven and earth"" to make sure Ukraine won the war. There has recently been an increasing number of pledges to increase military support to Ukraine, including Germany's announcement that it will send 50 anti-aircraft tanks, in a sharp U-turn in policy. Western officials have been briefing on the latest in the war and they say Russia has continued to build up forces in and around the Donbas and are making minor gains. ""But when they come up against genuine military objectives, they are finding it difficult to overcome the staunch Ukrainian resistance and they are suffering losses,"" an official said. Heavy rain is also hampering Russian progress. ""Russians don't like to fight in the rain,"" an official said, adding that the Russians have poor tactical awareness and continue to suffer from logistical difficulties. They have the ability to operate off road, but officials say it's surprising that they still choose not to do so. Even in places where Ukrainian forces have found themselves encircled, they have managed to resupply their forces ""for a surprising length of time"". (Mariupol being the most obvious example). Officials noted that even in places where Russia has taken ground, Ukrainian forces have shown a ""remarkable"" ability to counter-attack - sometimes doing it so fast that the Russians quickly find themselves on the back foot. Ukrainian special forces, operating behind Russian lines, are exploiting the vulnerability of long supply lines, which helps to buy time for Ukraine. "

487,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-61251698,2022-04-27T21:40:22,"Push Russia out of whole of Ukraine, says Truss"," Russian forces must be pushed out of ""the whole of Ukraine"", the Foreign Secretary Liz Truss has said. In a keynote speech in London, Ms Truss said victory for Ukraine was now a ""strategic imperative"" for the West. This amounts to the clearest statement yet of Britain's war aims which have, until now, been limited to stating that President Putin's invasion of Ukraine ""must fail and be seen to fail"". She said Western allies must ""double down"" in their support for Ukraine. ""We will keep going further and faster,"" Ms Truss said, ""to push Russia out of the whole of Ukraine."" This implies that Russian forces must leave not just the territory occupied in recent weeks since their invasion on 24 February but also those areas they invaded and annexed eight years ago, such as Crimea in the south and parts of the eastern Donbas region. A month into this latest invasion, Russia declared its main goal was the ""liberation of Donbas"" - broadly referring to Ukraine's regions of Luhansk and Donetsk. More than a third of this area was already seized by Russian proxy forces in a war that began in 2014. Not all western powers may share Ms Truss' ambitious target, fearing it is unlikely to be achieved either by arms or negotiation. Some French and German officials have been more cautious about stating war aims that risk provoking Russia, preferring to focus instead on language about defending Ukraine. The foreign secretary's latest remarks in a speech at Mansion House in London reflect the desire by some in the West to aim high, so that Ukraine enters any possible future talks about a political settlement to the conflict with the best negotiating hand possible. Ms Truss also used her speech to make clear the West should do more to deter future Russian aggression. This, she said, should include more spending on defending itself, with the Nato target of spending 2% of national output on defence seen as ""a floor not a ceiling"". She also said Western powers should use their ""economic heft"" to exclude Russia from western markets. ""Access to the global economy must depend on playing by the rules,"" she said. But Labour's shadow foreign secretary, David Lammy, said earlier on Wednesday that the speech ""appears to be an admission of failure after more than a decade of decline"" in the government's commitment to defence and security. Ms Truss also set out her view that the West should send weapons to other countries threatened by Russia. ""We must ensure that, alongside Ukraine, the Western Balkans and countries like Moldova and Georgia have the resilience and the capabilities to maintain their sovereignty and freedom."" She added that if Sweden or Finland chose to join Nato, ""we must integrate them as soon as possible"". She said: ""The war in Ukraine is our war - it is everyone's war… because Ukraine's victory is a strategic imperative for all of us. ""Heavy weapons, tanks, aeroplanes - digging deep into our inventories, ramping up production. We need to do all of this."" ""We cannot be complacent - the fate of Ukraine remains in the balance. And let's be clear - if Putin succeeds there will be untold further misery across Europe and terrible consequences across the globe. Russia's president Vladimir Putin warned earlier on Wednesday that any country meddling in Ukraine would be met with a ""lightning"" fast response. ""We have all the tools [to respond] that no one can boast of,"" he told Russian lawmakers. ""And we will not be bragging about them, we will use them if necessary."" "

Cutting supplies to the two European Union countries - ostensibly because of their refusal to pay in roubles as recently demanded by energy giant Gazprom - came as a surprise to many who thought President Vladimir Putin needed the income to finance his way in Ukraine. The condemnation was swift. Political leaders in Warsaw and Sofia decried the Russian ""blackmail"". European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the move demonstrated that Russia was ""unreliable"" as an energy partner. Read more about the reaction here. It's a question that has been asked again and again since the start of the war on 24 February. Europe depends on Russia for more than a third of its gas needs and Gazprom holds a monopoly on pipeline supplies in Russia. While the EU has been firm that it will not comply with Mr Putin's demands that payments be made in roubles, Hungary has reached a workaround deal with Gazprom. Should Mr Putin decide to implement a full embargo, countries such as Germany and Italy would particularly hard hit, as you can see from the graphic above. So are there any alternatives? Can European countries find supplies elsewhere? Some of the answers are here. When Russian troops pulled out of northern Ukraine to concentrate on the east, it looked like the conflict was being scaled back, certainly geographically. But mysterious explosions in Transnistria, a breakaway Russian-controlled territory in Moldova bordering on Ukraine to the south-west, have raised fears that a new theatre of war may be opening. So what is happening in Moldova and how is it linked to the current conflict in Ukraine? More details are to be found here. Regardless of the speed with which events on the ground are moving, one conclusion is clear for Western countries bordering Russia: they are not as safe as they thought they were and neutrality - the umbrella that had served them in good stead in the past, may no longer suffice. Two in particular - Finland and Sweden - appear to have reached the conclusion that their best guarantee may be membership of the trans-Atlantic Nato alliance and its treaty article five - that an attack on a member is an attack on all. The two Nordic neighbours are considering a joint application. How will Russia react? Ros Atkins explains. Western values have been thrown into sharp focus by this conflict - so far. But when it comes to the next phase of the conflict, how long will that unity last? Our diplomatic correspondent, James Landale, analyses five issues that could ultimately divide the Western alliance. Which are they? A statue which once represented friendship between Ukraine and Russia has been brought down in Kyiv. The huge statue in the centre of the Ukrainian capital was ordered to be removed by the city's Mayor, Vitali Klitschko, who said ""Russia destroyed the normal life of millions of Ukrainians and destroyed the peace in Europe."" Crowds of people gathered to watch as the monument was dismantled, with some of them cheering the moment the job was completed. "

Since the start of the war, Ukraine has urged the company to take steps to stop its drones being used by Russia. The Chinese firm said the decision was not a statement about any country, and its drones are not for military use. But Taras Troiak, chairman of the Ukrainian Federation of UAV Owners, told the BBC he doubted it would stop Russia's military using DJI drones. He said that stores' supplies of drones might run out in a few months but, in his opinion, they could be easily smuggled into Russia from China. The drones are being used by Russia's military for short-range reconnaissance, he says. In Mr Troiak's view they are used ""to look around, to find any soldiers around and to make sure that nobody is very close to you"". He added: ""If they want to take, for example, a building or a factory, they can use the drones to find Ukrainian soldiers on the territory."" Mr Troiak said he understood that DJI wished to appear neutral in the conflict, but he felt supply should be cut to Russia and not to Ukraine. ""Because we are protecting our country. And we are using all sorts of civilian cars, civilian mobile phones and civilian drones. So that is not because we want to use the drones in military use, but actually, we don't have any other choice."" DJI told the BBC that military use of its equipment is against its principles. The suspension of operations by the world's largest commercial drone-maker is unusual for a major Chinese company. China has sought to remain neutral on the conflict, calling for a peaceful solution. But it has yet to condemn the Russian invasion. ""DJI is internally reassessing compliance requirements in various jurisdictions. Pending the current review, DJI will temporarily suspend all business activities in Russia and Ukraine,"" it said in a statement. In March, Ukraine's Vice Prime Minister, Mykhailo Fedorov, tweeted DJI to say: ""Block your products that are helping Russia to kill the Ukrainians."" An open letter attached to the tweet alleged that Russia was using DJI drones to help target missiles, and the company replied to stress its products were only for civilian use. It said that if Ukraine requested, it would turn on geofencing - a system that restricts where drones may operate, to prevent any DJI drone - whether Russian or Ukrainian - operating in the country. But it warned the system was not ""foolproof"". Mr Troiak shared with the BBC a link to a video apparently produced by Russian forces, which purports to show a drone used in combat in Mariupol. DJI's logo is visible on the controller. DJI says it does not: A DJI spokesperson told the BBC: ""We are concerned about the reported military use of our products as we stated on 21 April 2022."" They said the suspension of operations was ""a statement about our principles"". ""DJI has only ever made products for civilian use. They are not designed for military applications. ""Such use is against our principles and has potential legal compliance implications,"" the spokesperson added. "
490,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-61249628,2022-04-27T16:49:54,Ukraine war: Should we be worried about a gas supply crisis?," Russian energy giant Gazprom says it has halted gas exports to Poland and Bulgaria over the countries' refusal to pay for supplies in roubles - but how worried should we be? Both Poland and Bulgaria were already planning not to renew their contracts with Gazprom, which expire at the end of the year. In Poland's case, it had been filling its stores of gas ahead of time, which provides some cushion, especially as we approach the summer lull in use of gas. This escalation is real, and justified by the Kremlin on the basis of a refusal to pay for gas by changing money into roubles in Russian bank accounts. But the additional impact of today's news should be containable. Gas prices in the UK are well down on their record peaks of £5 per therm last month, at about £1.70. UK terminals have been flooded with liquefied natural gas (LNG) - over 100 tanker-loads so far this year - with the largest amount coming from the US. But it can't be stored here, and much is being re-exported to the European Union (EU). Indeed, market contacts suggest that the export pipeline of gas from the UK to continental Europe is currently at the limits of its capacity. These UK prices are still consistent with further rises in gas bills in October - perhaps of a few hundred pounds a year. All that would change, of course, if these moves today are the first skirmishes in an escalating European energy crisis that could see Germany cut off from Russian gas in the next few months. That would send prices spiralling across Europe and lead to a crisis of supply. There is some helpful ambiguity in what is termed ""forcing buyers to pay for Russian gas in roubles"". ""Various governments and companies stating 'we will not pay in roubles' therefore are not providing any clarity as to whether they will use the new payment process or not, which in turn means there is ambiguity over upcoming supply to other, larger, markets,"" says Tom Marzec-Manser, head of gas analytics at market information provider ICIS. German firms are paying in euros that are then exchanged into roubles at a specific Russian bank. This arrangement allows all to continue the mutual gas trade dependence, but it is a precarious balance. German ministers say that they are not afraid of paying the economic price to eliminate the ""strategic mistake"" of energy dependence on the Kremlin, but that they just cannot do it any time soon. So the actions of the Kremlin through Gazprom need to be put in perspective. It has cut off some supplies as a result of refusal to change the terms of payment, but notably this was to two countries which had already said their contracts with Gazprom would be allowed to expire this year. As the conflict continues, and Germany ups the ante in terms of supplies of weapons to Ukraine, the real question is about the flow of gas from Russia to Germany, which continued uninterrupted even during the height of the Cold War. This move is designed as a Kremlin shot across the bows of Europe's biggest economies. While Germany, for example, has said it is willing to phase out Russian coal in the summer, and hinted Russian oil could follow over the next year, gas is another matter. Last week, Germany's finance minister told me it would be physically impossible to immediately phase out the 45% dependence of Germany on Russia for its gas. "

Prime Minister Boris Johnson told MPs they should regard the sanctions as ""a badge of honour"". Tory ministers were on the list, along with Labour politicians including Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle. The UK sanctioned of 386 Russian parliamentarians last month as part of its response to the war in Ukraine. Russian's foreign ministry announced retaliatory sanctions against British MPs on Wednesday, accusing them of ""groundless efforts to whip up Russophobic hysteria in the UK"". The foreign ministry said the ""hostile rhetoric"" was ""aimed at demonising our country"" and work on countermeasures against the UK would continue. But Russia's sanctions list appeared out of date as it featured several former Conservative MPs, including Sir Oliver Letwin, Dominic Grieve and Justine Greening, who have not served in Parliament since the 2019 general election. Sanctions are penalties imposed by one country on another, typically in response to behaviour deemed hostile or in breach of international law. But some MPs did not seem fazed by Russia's sanctions after they were raised during Prime Minister's Questions in Parliament. At PMQs, Conservative MP Ben Everitt asked the prime minister to assure the House of Commons that he would continue to provide Ukraine with the support it needed. In reply, Mr Johnson said: ""It's, I think, no disrespect to those who haven't been sanctioned, when I say that all those 287 should regard it as a badge of honour. ""And what we will do is keep up our robust and principled support for the Ukrainian people and their right to protect their lives, their families, and to defend themselves. ""That's what this country is doing, and that has the overwhelming support, I think, of the whole House."" Conservative MPs on Russia's sanctions list included cabinet ministers Commons leader Mark Spencer and Environment Secretary George Eustice. Other ministers on the list were Jacob Rees-Mogg, Amanda Milling and Penny Mordaunt, as well as senior Tory backbenchers Steve Baker, Peter Bone and David Davis. For Labour, the party's shadow secretary of defence, John Healey, and shadow secretary of transport, Louise Haigh, were among those sanctioned by Russia. On social media, some MPs welcomed their inclusion on the list and condemned Russia's invasion of Ukraine. In a tweet, Mr Healey said ""these actions will not deter UK parliamentarians - on all sides - from standing united against Russian aggression"". Tory former chief whip Mark Harper said he was ""proud"" to be included and suggested ""Russia really hates being called out for their illegal invasion of Ukraine"". Former international development minister Andrew Murrison said he was ""delighted"", while former Brexit secretary David Davis asked ""how ever will I cope?"". Foreign Secretary Liz Truss announced the sanctions against 386 members of the Duma, the lower house of the Russian parliament, on 11 March. The sanctions were part of the UK's efforts to punish Russian President Vladimir Putin for his invasion of Ukraine and diminish his ability to prosecute the war. The UK has also imposed financial restrictions on Russian banks, businesses and wealthy oligarchs such as Chelsea FC owner Roman Abramovich. "

Julie Elliot from Lancashire said Timothy, who is severely autistic, was becoming ""more and more distressed"" as ""bombs dropped"". But as he is under 18 and unaccompanied, he cannot use the visa scheme, the government said. Ms Elliot and her husband previously adopted 10 children with disabilities. Timothy is non-verbal, and his mother Anna has struggled to guide him into the local subway shelter for safety when the city has been shelled by the Russian army. Russian forces withdrew from the area surrounding Kyiv in early April, but when bombs strike the city Timothy's protestations against entering the bunker have put himself and those around him in danger, Ms Elliot said. His mother wishes to remain in Kyiv after her eldest son was told to stay and fight, while Timothy's 17-year-old brother has escaped to Poland alone. Ms Elliot said Timothy was ""becoming more and more distressed"" and he ""can't talk and he can't process what's going on"". ""Everything can be very scary [for children with autism], even without a war"" and his mum is trying to cope ""whilst there are bombs dropping around them"", she added. The Elliots, who live in the Ribble Valley with their 14 children - four biological and 10 adopted - worked as nurses before becoming full-time carers and were made MBEs in 2016 for services to children. With documents proving permission from Timothy's mother, Ms Elliot applied for a visa for Timothy through the Homes For Ukraine scheme on 30 March but received no response confirming or denying the visa. She has since been separately told he is ineligible because he is under 18. A government spokesman said: ""Due to safeguarding requirements, unaccompanied minors are only eligible under the Homes For Ukraine scheme if they are reuniting with a parent or guardian in the UK."" The Press Association news agency understands that the government is continually reviewing its immigration policy and schemes and applications by people who are currently ineligible remain on hold in case changes are made to eligibility requirements. The Homes For Ukraine scheme website explains this under-18s policy, but older versions of the web page show that this detail was not added until 12 April, almost two weeks after Ms Elliot applied to help Timothy. She said: ""We just don't know what to do next, it just feels like you're shouting into the void. ""We're quite prepared to finance everything - all we are asking is for him to be safe in the UK with us. ""I am seriously thinking that I'm going to have to go [to Ukraine] and help [Timothy's mother]... I promised her over a month ago that I would help her - how can I just leave her like this?""

494,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-61239075,2022-04-27T13:57:11,"Ukraine: West should provide warplanes, says Liz Truss"," Britain and other Western powers should provide warplanes to Ukraine, Foreign Secretary Liz Truss will say, as part of long-term military support. In a major speech in London, Ms Truss will argue that the West ""must be prepared for the long haul and double down on our support"" for the country. Since Russia's invasion, Ukraine has repeatedly asked allies to supply heavy armaments such as aeroplanes and tanks. Nato has provided mostly only lighter weaponry amid fears of escalation. Ms Truss will tell an audience at Mansion House, in the City of London, that ""the fate of Ukraine remains in the balance"" and that the West ""cannot be complacent"". ""If Putin succeeds there will be untold further misery across Europe and terrible consequences across the globe. We would never feel safe again,"" she will say on Wednesday evening. ""Heavy weapons, tanks, aeroplanes - digging deep into our inventories, ramping up production. We need to do all of this."" Later, Downing Street said the government would not rule out training Ukrainian pilots or sending British jets to eastern Europe to ""backfill"" for allies who supply jets to Kyiv. ""Whilst there are no plans to send things like planes from the UK, certainly we want to work with other countries to ensure that Ukraine has the equipment that it needs,"" the prime minister's spokesman said. Ms Truss will also reiterate a call for a boost in UK defence spending. But Labour's shadow foreign secretary, David Lammy, said the speech ""appears to be an admission of failure after more than a decade of decline"" in the government's commitment to defence and security. Liz Truss's call for Ukraine to be given warplanes follows a growing trend. Western powers are ratcheting up military support for the country. Drones, long range artillery, better anti-aircraft defence systems. So why not fighter jets? Well, some countries - like Poland - have said they were willing to give Ukraine some aging MIG29s. But it has not happened. That's because Poland wanted the United States to replace the donated MIGs with newer, American combat aircraft. Poland also wanted the US to deliver the MIGs to Ukraine themselves. The US refused to do this, citing logistical difficulties and the risk of provoking Russia by flying aircraft from a Nato base into contested airspace. As of last week, the Pentagon said that while Ukraine might have received spare parts for planes, it had not received an entire aircraft from any country. Ukraine would dearly love some ground attack warplanes to target Russian armour and artillery. But that appears unlikely until such time that the scale of Western support for Ukraine is such that aircraft become a natural next step, and the need to help Kyiv outweighs the risk of Moscow escalating the conflict. So Ms Truss's remarks do not mean that RAF warplanes are about to be sent to Ukraine soon. What she is saying is that the option of giving Ukraine airpower should remain on the table. The trouble is that the loose language in the pre-briefed elements of her speech have triggered a debate that Western allies might not need right now. Asked three times if he backed his colleague's call to send planes, former foreign secretary - now deputy PM - Dominic Raab would not answer. But he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""We need to listen very carefully to what the Ukrainians need."" The speech comes just days after Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki confirmed his country had sent tanks to Ukraine. Germany has also pledged to send about 50 anti-aircraft tanks. As well as her demand for more defence spending at home, Ms Truss will argue that Nato's target of 2% of GDP - which the UK met last year - should be ""a floor, not a ceiling"". She will say there has been a ""generation of under-investment"" in the West, and the Russian invasion showed ""the architecture that was designed to guarantee peace and prosperity has failed Ukraine"". Labour's Mr Lammy said: ""The Conservatives wrongly de-emphasised European security in the Integrated Review, made deep cuts to the British army over many years, gave up soft power through cutting development, and hurt alliances with Europe and the United States, including by risking peace in Northern Ireland."" Prime Minster Boris Johnson said on Tuesday he would be happy for Ukrainian forces to use British-supplied weapons to strike targets inside Russia to protect themselves. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has said that, by arming Ukraine, Nato had already effectively ""entered into a war with Russia through proxies"". "

The firm said services will not be restored until payments are made in the Russian currency. It comes after Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered ""unfriendly"" countries to pay for gas in roubles. Poland confirmed supplies had stopped, but Bulgaria said it was still unclear whether supplies had been halted. Countries pay in advance for their gas, but as they have gone to pay for future supplies, Russia has stood firm on its demand made last month that new purchases need to be paid in roubles. The threat, in which Mr Putin said ""existing contracts will be stopped"", has been seen as an attempt boost the rouble, which has been hit by Western sanctions. Nathan Piper, head of oil and gas research at Investec, told the BBC the halting of supplies to Poland and Bulgaria was the ""start of Russia exerting economic pressure on Europe,"" and a move which could ""escalate"" with other EU nations. Poland's deputy foreign minister said the country could cope without Gazprom's gas and had ""taken some decisions many years ago to prepare for such a situation"". Marcin Przdacz told the BBC there were ""options to get the gas from other partners,"" including the US and gulf nations. ""I'm pretty sure that we will manage to handle this,"" he told the BBC. Polish state gas company PGNiG, which bought 53% of its gas imports from Gazprom in the first quarter of this year, described the suspension as a breach of contract, adding that the company would take steps to reinstate the gas supply. Meanwhile in Sofia, energy minister Alexander Nikolov said Bulgaria had paid for Russian gas deliveries for April and claimed supplier Gazprom will be in breach of its current contract if it halts the flow. ""Because all trade and legal obligations are being observed, it is clear that at the moment [Russian] natural gas is being used more as a political and economic weapon in the current war,"" Mr Nikolov said. Bulgaria, which relies on Gazprom for more than 90% of its gas supply, said it had taken steps to find alternative sources but no restrictions on gas consumption were currently required. The executive director of Bulgarian gas network operator Bulgartransgaz said supplies to Bulgaria were still currently flowing. Bulgaria also transports Russian gas via an extension of the Turk Stream pipeline to neighbouring Serbia and from there to Hungary. Hungary and Austria also said gas supplies were normal. The Prime Minister of the Czech Republic, Petr Fiala, said the country has had no signals or information on any interruption to its gas supplies, but must be prepared for any scenario. The central European country is almost entirely dependent on Russia for its gas. Russia's top lawmaker, Vyacheslav Volodin, said that gas giant Gazprom had made the right decision in suspending gas supplies to Bulgaria and Poland and said Moscow should do the same with other ""unfriendly"" countries. Meanwhile, Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, said Russia was using gas ""as an instrument of blackmail"". Ms von der Leyen said the EU was ""prepared for this scenario"" and had been ""working to ensure alternative deliveries and the best possible storage levels across the EU"". Investec's Mr Piper told the BBC the halting of supplies to Poland and Bulgaria was the ""start of Russia exerting economic pressure on Europe."" He said despite demand for gas declining as Europe enters summer, ""risks around Russian gas supply are keeping prices high, putting pressure on consumers and industry"". The latest move by Russia sent European gas prices up further on Wednesday, surging by 24%. Mr Putin's decree for gas payments means foreign buyers of Russian gas have to open an account at Russia's Gazprombank and transfer euros or US dollars into it. Gazprombank would then convert this into roubles which will then be used to make the payment for gas. This move is designed as a Kremlin shot across the bows of Europe's biggest economies. While Germany, for example, has said it is willing to phase out Russian coal in the summer, and hinted Russian oil could follow over the next year, gas is another matter. Last week Germany's finance minister told me it would be physically impossible to immediately phase out Germany's 45% dependence on Russia for gas. Both Poland and Bulgaria were already planning not to renew their contract with Gazprom which expires at the end of the year. In the case of Poland, it had been filling its stores of gas in preparation. The escalation is real, and justified by the Kremlin on the basis of countries refusing to pay for gas by changing money into roubles in Russian bank accounts. But the additional impact of Wednesday's news should be containable. All that would change, of course, if these moves are the first skirmishes in an escalating European energy crisis that could see Germany cut off from Russian gas. That would send prices spiralling across Europe and lead to a supply crisis. UK Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab earlier told Sky News the decision to cut off gas supplies will have ""a very damaging effect on Russia,"" adding that such moves could lead to the country becoming ""an economic pariah"". Following Russia's announcement, Poland's climate ministry said the country's energy supplies were secure. Climate Minister Anna Moskwa said there was no need to draw gas from reserves and gas to customers would not be cut. Poland was already planning to stop importing Russian gas by the end of the year, when its long-term supply contract with Gazprom expires. PGNiG said its underground gas storage was almost 80% full and it also has alternative supply sources, including a liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminal in Swinoujscie. On 1 May, a new gas pipeline connection with Lithuania is due to open that will give Poland access to gas from Lithuania's LNG terminal. And a new pipeline delivering gas from Norway, known as the ""Baltic Pipe"", comes online in October. It should reach full capacity by the end of the year and could replace all Russian deliveries. Supplies from Russia account for about 40% of the EU's natural gas imports. However, many countries have pledged to move away from Russian energy in response to its invasion of Ukraine. The US has declared a complete ban on Russian oil, gas and coal imports. Meanwhile, the UK is to phase out Russian oil by the end of the year, with gas to follow as soon as possible, and the EU is reducing gas imports by two-thirds. "

Birmingham City Council cabinet heard, up to 12 April, 425 Ukrainians were awaiting approval to join a city sponsor. According to Home Office data only 134 visas have been issued for people under the Homes for Ukraine scheme. The authority is also seeking to negotiate a contract to provide resettlement. The city council wants to negotiate a 12-month contract with Refugee Action to almost £7.2m per capita cost, to take in up to 1,000 refugees. The Local Democracy Reporting Service said the charity has historically supported Syrian and Afghani refugees in Birmingham under existing contracts with the council, but the authority acknowledged financial support and provisions will be ""time-limited"" and ""dependent upon available contingency resources"". Home Secretary Priti Patel has previously apologised for the ""frustrating"" visa delays which prevented Ukrainian refugees entering the UK. Tristan Chatfield, cabinet member for finance and resources, thanked residents who have offered up their homes to welcome those fleeing Ukraine. ""We've seen huge numbers seeking refuge to other countries, including here in the UK,"" he said. ""Birmingham is ready to play its part in welcoming our Ukrainian guests to the city. ""Previously we had taken 110 a year from the Syrian resettlement schemes. ""We've passed that number in the first six weeks of this scheme. The demand for places in the city is rising."" Robert Alden, leader of Birmingham Conservatives, questioned why the contract to resettle Ukrainian refugees was only tendered for one charity. But Professor Graeme Betts, director of adult social care at Birmingham city council, said the minimum length to hold a tendering process was 30 days which was ""too long"" given the circumstances of Ukrainian refugees.

Eden District Council was urged to sever ties with the part-state-owned gas and oil company, which heats municipal buildings in Penrith. But the authority said its deal was with the UK arm of the company, which is German controlled. It was also significantly cheaper than any available alternative, it said. Gazprom had refused to end the contract early, meaning the council would be in breach of the contract if it chose to do so, the Local Democracy Reporting Service said. However, councils across England have sought to cut ties with the company in protest at Russia's invasion. A number of local authorities have announced they will either end their contracts early or are seeking new suppliers. An Eden council spokesperson said it pays Gazprom 2.13p per Kwh for gas and the best alternative on the market was 12p per Kwh, a 563% increase. ""The change in ownership means that the council's contract is with the German government and not with Russia,"" the spokesperson said. ""Given this change in ownership, the huge increase in costs and the need to break the law to exit, the council has taken the decision to continue with the existing contract.""

Separatist authorities said Ukrainian ""infiltrators"" were responsible. But Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has blamed Russian special services. Russia says it is concerned. It has about 1,500 troops in Transnistria. An official has said Russian-speakers in Moldova are being oppressed. This is the same excuse used to justify the invasion of Ukraine. In the past two days, the Transnistria authorities say, explosions targeted: No casualties were reported, but a red ""anti-terrorism"" alert is now in force, meaning heightened security in the territory, which broke away from Moldova in a brief war in 1992. A Transnistria official said three unidentified infiltrators from Ukraine had attacked the security HQ with a grenade launcher. That claim has not been verified. The Kremlin says it is watching the situation closely and ""it is a cause for concern"". In Kyiv, President Zelensky was clear that Russia was behind it, adding: ""The goal is obvious - to destabilise the situation in the region, to threaten Moldova. They show that if Moldova supports Ukraine, there will be certain steps."" ""But we understand their capabilities, the Armed Forces of Ukraine are ready for this and are not afraid of them,"" Mr Zelensky said on Tuesday. A flare-up in Transnistria could destabilise Moldova and open up a new front in the Ukraine war. Odesa, Ukraine's key port city, lies just east of Transnistria. If Russia reinforces Transnistria, it might then move on Odesa from the west. Its push on the city from the east was blocked by Ukrainian troops. That would divert Ukrainian forces who are already seriously stretched. On Friday a top Russian general, Rustam Minnekayev, said ""control over the south of Ukraine is another way out to Transnistria, where there are also cases of oppression of the Russian-speaking population"". President Vladimir Putin has pledged to ""protect"" ethnic Russians in ex-Soviet republics. That was his argument for invading Ukraine. Moldova was formerly a Soviet republic. Today Moldova's closest ally is Romania but, unlike Romania, Moldova is not in Nato or the EU. Many Moldovans have Romanian passports and work in the EU. Moldova is one of Europe's poorest countries. It is also home to many ethnic Ukrainians. It has taken in more than 437,000 Ukrainian refugees, and in a country of 2.6 million people that is higher than any other country for the size of its population. Moldova's President Maia Sandu is strongly pro-EU, but her predecessor Igor Dodon - who still has many supporters - was pro-Russian. Moldova has banned public displays of the St George ribbon and the Z sign identified with the Russian military invasion of Ukraine. The separatist region of Transnistria - a narrow strip of land between the Dniester river and the Ukrainian border - proclaimed independence from Moldova in 1990 - though the international community does not recognise its self-declared statehood. After World War Two, Moscow created Moldova's forerunner, the Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic, from the mainly Russian-speaking Dniester region, which had been an autonomous part of Ukraine, and the neighbouring region of Bessarabia, which had been part of Romania from 1918-1940. But as the Soviet Union collapsed, alarm grew in the Dniester region over growing Moldovan nationalism and the possible reunification of Moldova with Romania, and the region proclaimed its secession. Up to 700 people were killed in a short border war between Moldova and Transnistria - a ceasefire was signed in 1992. The settlement was enforced by the Russian troops stationed in Transnistria. "

The humanitarian hub is manned by volunteers and was set up at London Luton Airport in partnership with local authorities and emergency services. People who have left their homes can get advice, information and mental and physical health support. The BBC has been given access to the hub and has spoken to those arriving about their journey so far. Sixteen-year-old Anastasiia fled Ukraine with her mother Oksana, and grandmother Nadiia. The three generations left their home after the block they lived in was hit by a bomb. ""Everything was shaking and it was very scary,"" the teenager said. ""I was afraid for my life, for my relatives and my dogs."" Anastasiia said it was ""very hard"" for the family to make a decision about leaving their home but after the airport in their town was destroyed, they decided to flee. Her mother went on Facebook and connected with their sponsor, Karla. ""I think that was the best day of my life,"" Anastasiia said. ""I'm very glad to be here right now. Thank you all very much."" Karla Bishop-Loach said she decided to sponsor a Ukrainian family after the death of one of her mother's friends who ""always helped everybody"". ""I suggested it to my husband and he said he had been thinking the same,"" she said. ""Straight away we went on Facebook and met with Oksana and her family and since then we've been in contact every day. ""We just felt the love straight away."" Mrs Bishop-Loach said the sponsorship process had been ""quite long"" so she was glad the family were now in the UK. ""We all got goosebumps,"" she said. ""It's just amazing - it feels like we already know each other. ""We haven't got a big house, but it's filled with lots of love and care and hopefully they will feel at home."" Liz Hughes, senior chaplain at London Luton Airport, said the hub was set up as the welcome Ukrainian people received was ""really important"". ""I think they've been pleased to have somebody here who is actually smiling and saying 'we're happy to have you',"" she said. Ms Hughes said most people coming through the hub ""just need pointing to the right train to get"". ""We can help them with onward travel to meet their sponsor and give them directions in English on a piece of paper they can show people for help,"" she said. Nick Orwin, emergency planning manager for London Luton Airport, said the hub was set up to make sure people arriving could be put in a ""safe place"". ""At the airport we were really worried about people coming into the UK and not having help when they arrive,"" he said. ""We feel responsibility for them and the people from Ukraine are coming from a really terrible situation - so we wanted to make sure we had the resources to help them.""

500,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-61237762,2022-04-26T23:22:13,Ukraine war: The West is united for now - but what if it splits?," Russia's invasion of Ukraine has united the West, the conflict throwing its values into sharp focus. But when it comes to the next phase of the conflict, how long will that unity last? Here are five issues that could ultimately divide the Western alliance. Before the war, liberal democracies appeared at times uncertain of their focus and future. Some questioned their alliances, while others succumbed to nationalist sentiment. But the conflict has reminded the West of what it represents - freedom, sovereignty and the rule of law. This in turn has produced a united response to Russia's aggression. But despite all the diplomacy by the UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres and others, this war may go on for some time. Might we be at the high watermark of consensus within the Western alliance? There are some tough choices ahead that may make it hard for Western powers to stay on the same diplomatic page. Perhaps the most important tensions could come over the aims of the war. At the moment the West is united behind the defence of Ukraine. It is providing economic and military support to help the country resist. But what is the longer-term aim? A cessation of hostilities, of course. But must Russia be defeated? Must Ukraine win? What would defeat and victory look like in practical terms? UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson told MPs last week: ""We must simply do everything we can collectively to ensure that Vladimir Putin fails, and fails comprehensively."" But what does ""fail"" mean? Mr Johnson did not say. One thing he did reject was pushing for regime change in Moscow. ""It is very important… that we do not make it an objective to remove the Russian leader or to change politics in Russia,"" he said. ""This is about protecting the people of Ukraine. Putin will try to frame it as a struggle between him and the West, but we cannot accept that."" Yet that is increasingly what the United States is doing. The US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin has suggested it would not be enough simply to defeat Russian forces. ""We want to see Russia weakened to the degree that it can't do the kinds of things that it has done in invading Ukraine,"" he said. That could mean targeting sanctions on Russia's defence sector. Or it could mean giving Ukraine the means to destroy a significant part of Russia's military forces. Either way, not all Western allies may share such ambitions, fearing Putin might exploit the rhetoric to claim the West was indeed posing an existential threat to Russia. The West is largely united in supporting Ukraine militarily. But it differs over specifics. Some countries are reluctant to provide heavy weaponry, fearing it could prolong the bloodshed. Others are increasing their deliveries of ammunition and more powerful weapons. Tobias Ellwood, the Defence Select Committee chairman, wants Britain to give more. ""We are doing enough to prevent Ukraine from losing but not enough to ensure they win,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""We need to help Ukraine absolutely win rather than just defend the current lines."" Note how he links talk of the means to a debate about the ends. But others in the West may fear turning the defence of Ukraine into a full proxy war with Russia could push Putin in escalating the conflict, either by attacking other Western targets, launching cyber-attacks or even using weapons of mass destruction. Not for nothing did Russia's foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, warn of the ""serious and real"" risk of nuclear war. At some point, there may be a military stalemate and pressure may grow for a political settlement. The overwhelming assumption is the West will back whatever Ukraine chooses to do. But what if that is not the case? What if some Western countries put pressure on Ukraine to sue for peace but the leadership in Kyiv wants to keep fighting? Might some countries start limiting their military support for Ukraine? Or alternatively, what if Ukraine agrees a political settlement the West opposes, thinking it rewards Russia too much? Might some countries refuse to lift sanctions on Russia and potentially scupper a peace deal? There is a critical debate taking place among Western policymakers about what kind of political settlement could be agreed in Ukraine. Will the priority be regaining control of territory seized by Russia - or ensuring the future security, integrity and viability of what is left of Ukraine after the fighting stops? A senior western official revealed this tension in almost the same breath. ""Putin cannot be seen to have successfully adjusted the sovereign boundaries of Ukraine by force,"" he said, before adding, ""Our long-term plan for Ukraine is that it succeeds as a sovereign and independent state."" Those two objectives are not necessarily the same thing. In practical terms, this means there will be tough choices when it comes to agreeing a political settlement. Should, for example, the West push for Russian forces to withdraw fully to pre-February 2022 borders or leave just some of the areas they have occupied? For Ben Wallace, the UK Defence Secretary, neither option would be enough. ""For my part, I want Putin not only beyond the pre-February boundaries,"" he told MPs. ""He invaded Crimea illegally, he invaded Donetsk illegally and he should comply with international law and in the long run leave Ukraine."" That may not be a view shared by others in the West. Western powers could fall out over sanctions. For now, they have agreed to disagree over how hard to punish Russia, especially whether more sanctions should be imposed on its oil and gas exports. Countries dependent on Russian energy say their economies could not survive without it. But if the fighting continues for some time, there may be counter pressures. Some countries might want to increase sanctions on Moscow to try to end the stalemate. Others might want to reduce energy sanctions as their own populations become less tolerant of the economic cost. It is equally possible for the West to disagree over Ukraine's longer-term future. What happens if there are divisions within Ukraine? What if factions emerge, such as nationalists who want to continue fighting, and compromisers who want to agree a deal? Would the West have to take sides? How bitter might the divisions be within Ukraine? Some analysts have even speculated about the possibility of civil war, making comparisons to the divisions within Ireland in 1922. Or what if Ukraine began making policy choices the West might oppose? Fiona Hill, the Russia expert and former US National Security Council official, has suggested Ukraine might even seek to own a nuclear weapon to ensure its future security. ""The more Putin keeps putting nuclear weapons out there… it's just more pressure on countries like Ukraine to think the only real way for defence is to rush out and get a nuclear weapon,"" she told a seminar at the Changing Europe think tank. Would, in such circumstances, the West be willing to provide Ukraine with conventional weapons? Or even consider its possible membership of the European Union? The point is that policy positions in conflict are rarely static and it may be wrong to assume Western unity will automatically sustain through the challenges ahead. "

503,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-61235301,2022-04-26T22:02:58,Ukraine war: Russia accuses UK of provoking attacks on its territory," The Russian government has accused the UK of ""provoking"" Ukraine into attacking Russian territory. Russia's defence ministry said it was ready to hit ""decision-making centres"" in Kyiv should such attacks occur. The presence of Western advisers at such centres might not affect its decision to retaliate, it added. It comes after a UK defence minister said it was ""not necessarily a problem"" for Ukraine to use UK-supplied arms against military targets in Russia. James Heappey said Ukrainian military strikes to disrupt supply lines were a ""legitimate"" part of war, and described Russian claims of Nato being in conflict with Russia as ""nonsense"". Russia has claimed Ukrainian forces have attacked targets within its territory, including an oil depot in Belgorod, but Ukraine has not confirmed any strikes. Western countries have donated hundreds of millions of pounds of military aid to Ukraine since Russia launched its invasion back in February, and Nato and European Union officials have been meeting in Germany to discuss further military assistance. The UK government has announced it will give Ukrainian forces a small number of anti-aircraft vehicles. In a statement quoted by the Interfax news agency, the Russian defence ministry said: ""We would like to stress that the direct provoking by London of the Kyiv regime into such activities [attacking Russian territory], should there be an attempt to realise them, will immediately lead to our proportional response."" The ministry also said Russian armed forces were ready to ""deliver retaliatory strikes using long-range high-accuracy weaponry"" against ""centres taking relevant decisions"" in the Ukrainian capital Kyiv. ""The advisers from among the subjects of one of the Western countries that are located in Ukrainian decision-making centres in Kyiv will not necessarily be a problem when Russia decides to take retaliatory action,"" the ministry said. Foreign minister Sergei Lavrov also accused Nato of conducting a proxy war, and said Western weapons being delivered to Ukraine would be fair targets. Mr Lavrov claimed the West was ""pouring oil on the fire"" by providing Ukraine with firepower, and repeated warnings that the conflict could lead to a third world war. But Mr Heappey told BBC Radio 4's Today programme it was Ukraine that makes the decisions of where and what to target, rather than the countries or companies that manufacture and export the weapons. Mr Heappey added: ""It is entirely legitimate to go after targets in the depth of your opponents to disrupt their logistics and supply lines."" He added that it was also a legitimate part of war for Russian forces to be striking targets in western Ukraine to disrupt Ukrainian supply lines, as long as they avoided targeting civilians - ""which unfortunately they have not taken much regard for so far"". UK defence sources later sought to clarify Mr Heappey's remarks, who also told Times Radio it was ""not necessarily a problem"" for British-supplied arms to be used by Ukrainian forces against military targets in Russia, after acknowledging that weapons now being supplied have the range to be used over borders. The sources said the UK was not involved in Ukrainian targeting, and the minister's use of the phrase ""deep strike precision targeting"" referred to stopping the relentless bombardment of Russian artillery, not striking targets in Russia. ""The UK and many other Western allies are now providing longer-range weapon systems to help counter the indiscriminate artillery fire that the Russian armed forces have been raining down on besieged Ukrainian cities,"" the sources told the BBC. ""Targeting is a matter for Ukraine, but the UK expects all parties in this conflict to decide on their military targets in full compliance with the laws of armed conflict."" Later, Prime Minister Boris Johnson was asked in a Talk TV interview if he was happy for British weapons to be used against targets like oil refineries within Russia - and he replied that Ukraine had a right to defend itself. ""We don't want the crisis to escalate beyond Ukraine's borders,"" he said. ""But the Ukrainians, plainly, as James [Heappey] has said, they have a right to defend themselves. They're being attacked from within Russian territory... they have a right to protect and defend themselves"". Ukraine is fighting an existential war with Russia so it is unsurprising Ukrainian forces should target supply lines over the Russian border. It is equally unsurprising Western powers are relaxed that some of their weaponry are used in such strikes. What is interesting about James Heappey's remarks is their frankness. In other conflicts, such as in Yemen, British ministers tend to be coy about the use of British weapons. On one level, the defence minister is just revealing his usual candour. He often speaks more as a former soldier than a politician. But on another level, his remarks reflect Nato's deepening involvement in this conflict. The weapons provided by Western powers are getting bigger and more powerful. It is one thing to give Ukraine short-range anti-tank bazookas. It is another to provide them with drones and artillery that can cross borders. The line between defending Ukraine and attacking Russia is increasingly blurred. For months, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has been asking Western allies for more weapons to fight off the Russian invasion. On Monday, Defence Secretary Ben Wallace announced the UK would gift a small number of Stormer vehicles fitted with launchers for Starstreak anti-aircraft missiles to give Ukrainian forces ""enhanced, short-range anti-air capabilities both day and night"". He also told the Commons around 15,000 Russian troops had been killed since Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, while 2,000 of its armoured vehicles had either been destroyed or captured. Meanwhile, Mr Johnson has said he does not expect Russia to use nuclear weapons in Ukraine, even if President Vladimir Putin suffered more military failures there. The prime minister told TalkTV he thought Mr Putin had enough ""political space"" to back down and withdraw, given the ""overwhelming"" support he enjoys in Russia and the ""apparent obliviousness of the Russian media"".

Mr Guterres made clear the UN considered this an invasion, and said he stood ready to deploy resources to evacuate civilians stranded in the Ukrainian city of Mariupol, a hotspot for the conflict where soldiers and civilians have been besieged in a steelworks for weeks. Mr Putin said fighting had stopped in Mariupol and that Russian soldiers were doing nothing to stop civilians leaving. He accused Ukrainian soldiers of holding civilians as human shields. But Ukrainian defenders have said attacks are continuing and civilians are trapped. America's top defence official warned the West it had to ""move at the speed of war"" to support Ukraine's military fight against the Russian invasion. Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin, a retired four-star general, told a gathering of 40 nations' defence ministers that the coming weeks would be ""so crucial for Ukraine"". Germany slightly shifted its position of not supplying weapons to Ukraine. The country has a long-standing policy of not exporting its military equipment, but has now agreed to provide about 50 mobile anti-aircraft systems. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov warned that Nato's support for Ukraine could cause the conflict to escalate into a world war. A UK defence minister has said it would be ""perfectly legitimate"" for Ukraine to use military equipment donated by Britain to strike targets within Russia. Moscow reacted by saying it was ready with a ""proportional response"" to hit ""decision-making centres"" in the Ukrainian capital - and would not be deterred from hitting them even if Western military advisers were present. That prompted UK defence officials to clarify James Heappey's comments - stressing that the UK was not involved in the targeting process. A long-running threat from Russia to cut off gas supplies to EU states started to take shape as Poland's national gas company PGNiG said Russia was suspending a contract for natural gas delivery from Wednesday morning. PGNiG said that reserve stocks were mostly full, and customers would see no disruption for the time being. But the move is a sign of wider potential problems across the continent. Russia supplies roughly 40% of the EU's gas imports, and the continent does not have enough to supply itself. Amid heightened tensions, Russia has demanded ""hostile countries"" pay it for energy in its own currency, roubles. The World Bank says the war in Ukraine is set to cause the ""largest commodity shock"" since the 1970s - meaning huge price rises for goods ranging from natural gas to wheat and cotton. The increases will affect the poorest most, but households and business of all sizes will feel the effects. Wheat is predicted to go up in price by almost 43% and reach new highs, chicken could go up nearly 42%, soybeans 20% and oil 30%. The BBC's Jonathan Josephs has taken a dive into the report and what it could mean. While the focus was on diplomacy outside of Ukraine, ordinary people living there continued to deal with the day-to-day impact of the war. Nina Malenok is one of a handful of people who've stayed in the small village of Senkivka near the Ukrainian border. Wedged into the yard of her home is the tail of a rocket fired in the early hours of 24 February - the day the war started. In the days that followed, hidden in a cellar, she heard planes flying overhead, heavy vehicles driving in and whistles being frequently blown. ""It's scary to live like this, but I'm used to my house. Where will I go?"" she said. Read more about Nina's experience and the impact of a community torn apart by war. "

She has been offered work in the town and said: ""I feel safe now."" ""I have the place where I don't have shots, explosions and I can go to shop, I can go to outside,"" she added. She was living in Mikolaiv when the war broke out and said: ""I don't I understand why it's happened."" Yuliia is one of three refugees staying with Emma Nishigaki through the Homes for Ukraine scheme and she said she was grateful for simple things like not having to turn the lights off in her room for fear of attack. Ms Nishigaki said: ""I feel like a guilt that I'm living somewhere safe, that I'm not involved, that I'm not going through what they've been through."" She said that taking in refugees and making their life easier ""sort of helps me cope with that guilt"". She has set up a support centre for refugees in Evesham.

In a new forecast, it said disruption caused by the conflict would contribute to huge price rises for goods ranging from natural gas to wheat and cotton. The increase in prices ""is starting to have very large economic and humanitarian effects"", Peter Nagle, a co-author of the report, told the BBC. He said ""households across the world are feeling the cost of living crisis"". ""We're particularly worried about the poorest households since they spend a larger share of income on food and energy, so they're particularly vulnerable to this price spike,"" the senior economist at the World Bank added. Energy prices are set to increase more than 50%, pushing up bills for households and businesses, the World Bank says. The biggest rise will be in the price of natural gas in Europe, which is set to more than double in cost. Prices are forecast to fall next year and in 2024, but even then will remain 15% higher than they were last year. The World Bank said this means that from the lows of April 2020 until the highs of March this year we have seen ""the largest 23-month increase in energy prices since the 1973 oil price hike"", when tensions in the Middle East sent prices soaring. Similarly oil prices are expected to remain elevated into 2024 with a barrel of the benchmark measure, Brent Crude, projected to average $100 this year, something which will lead to widespread inflation. Russia produces about 11% of the world's oil, the third biggest share, but the report said ""disruptions resulting from the war are expected to having a lasting negative effect"" as sanctions mean that foreign companies leave and access to technology is reduced. Russia currently provides 40% of the EU's gas and 27% of its oil, but European governments are moving to wean their countries off of supplies from Russia. That has helped push up global prices by creating more demand for supplies from elsewhere. The World Bank commodity outlook also warned many foods are set to see steep rises in their costs. The UN food prices index already shows they are at their highest since records began 60 years ago. Wheat is forecast to increase 42.7% and reach new record highs in dollar terms. Other notable increases will be 33.3% for barley, 20% for soybeans and 29.8% for oils and 41.8% for chicken. These increases reflect the fact that exports from Ukraine and Russia have fallen drastically. Before the war the two countries accounted for 28.9% of global wheat exports according to JP Morgan, and 60% of global sunflower supplies - a key ingredient in many processed foods - according to S&P Global. Prices for other raw materials including fertilisers, metals and minerals are also predicted to go up. The costs of timber, tea and rice are amongst the few expected to fall. ""Wheat is one of the hardest agriculture exports to replace,"" according to a research note from the Bank of America. It points out that poor weather conditions in North America and China are likely to exacerbate the impact of Ukrainian supplies being reduced, something which will continue because the war has disrupted the spring planting season. The note also suggests grain and oilseed shipments from Ukraine have fallen more than 80% because of the fighting and these lost exports, over the course of a year, ""equate to about 10 days of world food supply"". The chief executive of Archer Daniels Midland, one of the world's four big food commodity traders, said he does not expect prices to come down soon. As the US firm announced a 53% increase in net earnings for the first three month of this year, to $1.05bn, Juan Luciano said: ""We expect reduced crop supplies - caused by the weak Canadian canola crop, the short South American crops, and now the disruptions in the Black Sea region - to drive continued tightness in global grain markets for the next few years"". Mr Nagle, from the World Bank, said other countries can help solve the supply shortage caused by Ukraine's war in the medium term. However a forecast 69% increase in fertiliser prices this year means ""there's a real risk that as farmers start to use fewer fertilisers, agricultural yields will decline"". For commodities overall, the World Bank report said: ""While prices generally are expected to peak in 2022, they are to remain much higher than previously forecast."" It added that ""the outlook for commodity markets depends heavily on the duration of the war in Ukraine"" and the disruption it causes to supply chains. "

He said Russia had been saying it was in a conflict with Nato before the war began - ""it's nonsense and [Mr] Lavrov knows it"". Mr Heappey added he thought the chances of a nuclear war were ""vanishingly small"", with no-one wanting such an outcome to the conflict. Russia's defence ministry has also accused the UK of provoking Ukraine into attacks on facilities located in Russian territory. It added that Russia would give a ""proportional response"" to any such attempt, the Interfax news agency reports.

But he said that no fixed date had been set for any potential application. The comments came as Nordic media reported the countries could launch a simultaneous bid to join the security bloc next month. Stockholm and Helsinki have long pursued policies of military neutrality to avoid conflict with regional powers. But during a visit to Sweden earlier this month, Finnish Prime Minister Sanna Marin said ""everything had changed"" when Russia attacked Ukraine and told reporters that Helsinki must to be ""prepared for all kinds of actions from Russia"". Her comments coincided with the publication of a security report that warned Finland's membership of Nato could result in ""increased tensions on the border between Finland and Russia"". Finnish newspaper Iltalehti reported on Monday that the two countries' leaders could meet in the week of 16 May to announce the bid during a state visit to Sweden by Finnish President Sauli Niinisto. Finland shares a 1,340km (830 miles) border with Russia, and Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has stressed that Moscow would have to ""rebalance the situation"" with its own measures if the Nato bid went ahead. And there have been some reports that Russia had started to move military equipment towards the Russian-Finnish border, although US officials said they had seen nothing to confirm that. But Swedish outlet Aftonbladet reported that the US and UK have agreed to provide security support during the application process, citing government officials. US defence sources told the outlet that Sweden and Finland would be treated as de-facto members of the security alliance for the duration of the application process. The UK and US support would reportedly include an increased number of troops in the Nordic nations, further intelligence co-operation, assistance in combatting cyber threats and an increased presence of Nato warships in the Baltic sea. Last week Sweden's Foreign Minister Ann Linde said a wide-ranging security review being carried out by Stockholm will be completed by 13 May, rather than 31 May as initially planned. She noted that with Finland's analysis now complete ""there is now a lot of pressure"" to urgently publish the report, and her party, the Social Democrats, are expected to drop their traditional opposition to joining the bloc. Russia sees Nato as a threat to its security, and before the war in Ukraine Russian President Vladimir Putin demanded that the bloc removed its forces from Eastern European member states. However, Russia's invasion has had the opposite effect, with Nato bolstering its forces in Eastern Europe and traditionally neutral countries now on the verge of joining the bloc. Public sentiment in both Sweden and Finland towards Nato membership has changed dramatically since Russia launched its invasion over two months ago. In Finland, opinion polls show that public support for joining bloc has climbed from 28% in February to 68% last month. Meanwhile, 57% of Swedes now favour NATO membership, up from 51% in March. "

513,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-60664169,2022-04-26T09:09:39,Ukraine war: Could Russia use tactical nuclear weapons?," Soon after Russia invaded Ukraine, President Vladimir Putin said he was moving his ""deterrent forces"" - meaning nuclear weapons - to ""combat ready"" status. This has raised fears that Moscow could use ""tactical"" nuclear weapons - not an all-out nuclear war, but still a dramatic development. Tactical nuclear weapons are those which could be used over relatively short distances. This distinguishes them from ""strategic"" nuclear weapons. In the Cold War, these were the bombs which the two superpowers, the US and Soviet Union, could launch over long distances at each other's homeland. The term ""tactical"" nevertheless incorporates many types of weapon, including smaller bombs and missiles used as ""battlefield"" weapons. Russia is thought to have about 2,000 tactical nuclear weapons. These can be placed on various types of missiles which are normally used to deliver conventional explosives. They can even be fired as artillery shells on a battlefield. They have also been developed for aircraft and ships - for instance torpedoes and depth charges to target submarines. These warheads are believed to be in storage facilities, rather than deployed and ready to fire. But one concern is that Russia could be more willing to use smaller tactical weapons than larger strategic missiles. ""They might not see it as crossing this big nuclear threshold. They could see it as part of their conventional forces,"" says Dr Patricia Lewis, head of the international security programme at the Chatham House think tank. Tactical nuclear weapons vary enormously in size and power. The smallest can be one kiloton or less (equivalent to a thousand tonnes of the explosive TNT) - the larger ones perhaps as big as 100 kilotons. The effects would depend on the size of the warhead, how far above the ground it detonates and the local environment. But as a comparison, the atomic bomb that killed around 146,000 people in Hiroshima, Japan, during World War Two, was 15 kilotons. Russia's largest strategic weapons are thought to be at least 800 kilotons. President Putin has made more than one reference to Russia's nuclear weapons - apparently to try to create a sense of fear. US spies see this as a signal to the West to persuade it not to intervene more in Ukraine, not as a sign he is planning nuclear war. But others worry that even though the chances are low, it is possible Russia, in certain conditions, might be tempted to use a smaller tactical weapon in Ukraine. ""Putin is comfortable in the 'stability-instability' world, while the West is deterred by his nuclear bluster as if Nato's billion-dollar deterrent is nothing but a paper tiger,"" tweeted Dr Mariana Budjeryn, a nuclear expert with the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs, at the Harvard Kennedy School. US intelligence say Russia has a theory called ""escalate to de-escalate"" if it is in a conflict with Nato. This involves doing something dramatic - such as using a tactical weapon on the battlefield, or as a demonstration somewhere - or threatening to do so. The idea is to frighten the other side into backing down. The concern is that if Putin feels cornered and that his strategy in Ukraine is failing, he could use tactical nuclear weapons as a ""game changer"", to break a stalemate or avoid defeat. But the situation would likely have to get worse in Ukraine - or back in Russia - for him to consider this. James Acton, a nuclear expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Pace in Washington DC, says: ""I am legitimately worried that in that circumstance Putin might use a nuclear weapon, most likely on the ground in Ukraine to terrify everyone and get his way. We are not at that point yet."" Dr Heather Williams, nuclear expert at Kings College London, says one problem is that it is unclear what ""winning"" in Ukraine would look like for Putin - and thus what might drive Russia to use a nuclear weapon. Putin claims Ukraine is part of Russia, so using nuclear weapons on its territory seems bizarre. Russia itself is close by and ""the fallout could cross boundaries"", warns Patricia Lewis. The only time nuclear weapons have been used in conflict was by the US at the end of World War Two against Japan. Would Putin want to become the first leader to break the taboo and use them? Some worry he has shown a willingness to do things others thought he would not do, whether invading Ukraine or using nerve agent in Salisbury. Dr Williams says there is a further reason why Russia might not use nuclear weapons - China. ""Russia is heavily dependent on Chinese support, but China has a 'no first use' nuclear doctrine. So if Putin did use them, it would be incredibly difficult for China to stand by him. If he used them, he would probably lose China."" No one knows quite where the use of tactical nuclear weapons would lead. It could escalate and Putin would not want nuclear war. But miscalculation is always a risk. ""They would imagine everyone would capitulate,"" says Patricia Lewis. ""What would happen is that Nato would have to come in and respond."" The US says it is monitoring the situation closely. It has an extensive intelligence gathering machine to watch Russian nuclear activity - for instance whether tactical weapons are being moved out of storage, or if there is any change in behaviour at launch sites. So far, they say they have not seen any significant changes. How the US and Nato would respond to any nuclear use is hard to predict. They may not want to escalate the situation further and risk all-out nuclear war but they also might want to draw a line. This might mean a tough conventional rather than nuclear response. But what would Russia then do? ""Once you have crossed the nuclear threshold, there is no obvious stopping point,"" says James Acton. ""I don't think anyone can have any confidence of what that world would look like."" "

David Frankl, from Wimborne, Dorset, applied for visas for the family of five in March, under the Homes for Ukraine scheme. Mr Frankl, 70, was told the delay was due to the five-year-old girl needing extra safeguarding checks. The Home Office said it was vital ""robust processes"" were in place to protect children from trafficking. However, Mr Frankl believes the British government does not want the refugees in the country. ""We talk about being compassionate but the system is designed to fail,"" he said, adding: ""It's atrocious."" Mr Frankl, whose Jewish parents sought refuge in the UK from Nazi Germany during World War Two, and his wife, Astrid, got in touch with their local MP Sir Christopher Chope after ""getting nowhere"" with the Home Office. His office told them three visas had been ready for ""some time"" but two were still outstanding, including that of the now five-year-old daughter of the family. Mr Frankl said: ""The excuse given for visas for children taking longer is allegedly due to additional safeguarding checks. ""What additional information is being obtained or checked? They haven't asked for DNA testing. Why is only one child in the family not yet in receipt of a visa when the other one has?"" In a statement, the Home Office said: ""All applications from families are normally processed together, but cases differ in complexity, it is vital robust safeguarding processes are in place to protect children from trafficking and other risks."" A spokesperson added: ""The Home Office has made changes to streamline the application process so that thousands of visas are now being granted every day."" The family - a mother, father, sister-in-law and two children, all hail from Mariupol and no longer have a home to return to after the Russian bombing of the city. Mr Frankl said the father was able to leave Ukraine because he moved to Hungary for work in January so had left the country prior to the Russian invasion. Mr Frankl said he and his wife have ""got the space"" at their Wimborne home as it has three spare bedrooms. ""These refugees need compassion and help... we feel ashamed of our government's strategy,"" he said. Follow BBC South on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram.

516,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-61220296,2022-04-26T05:03:36,War in Ukraine: The village with Russia and Belarus on its doorstep," The village of Senkivka in Ukraine is situated at the nexus of the border crossing between Ukraine, Russia and Belarus. Once the site of festivals that celebrated the friendship between the three countries, it's now a war front line, and its residents tell of families separated across borders living in fear. With rare access to the village, Yogita Limaye has seen first-hand the impact of a community torn apart by war. Russian forces withdrew from northern Ukraine at the start of April, but mortar shelling and grenade attacks continue in Senkivka. Prior to the invasion, it was home to a little more than 200 people. Now there are just a handful who've stayed back. Nina Malenok's home is just by the side of a road that Russian troops used as they began their invasion of Ukraine, on their way to the northern city of Chernihiv, and the capital Kyiv. Wedged into the yard of Nina's home is the tail of a rocket fired in the early hours of the 24 February - the day the war started. ""I heard it land in my yard. There was fire and smoke everywhere. My lights went off. I jumped out of bed and ran out my house,"" said Nina. In the days that followed, hidden in a cellar, she heard planes flying overhead, heavy vehicles driving in and whistles being frequently blown. On 8 March, Russian TV journalists came to her home accompanied by Russian soldiers. ""They were filming everything here, all the shells and everything. They told me Ukraine was attacking itself. Then they sent the numbers [printed] on the rocket to someone in Russia, and received a response right away that it was one of theirs."" Many such rockets are scattered all over the village. Experts who've seen images of the rockets have told the BBC that they could have been carrying cluster bombs, banned in other parts of the world for the devastation they cause. Both Russia and Ukraine have been accused of using them. Even after the withdrawal, Nina does not feel safe. ""It's scary to live like this, but I'm used to my house. Where will I go? I can hear the shelling. I can show you from my yard the Russian checkpoint,"" she said. Her home, and others in the village are visible from Russia. Its troops can see what they have been firing at. For Lidiya Bilousova, it's the second time in her life she saw tanks at her doorstep. Born in 1930, she vividly remembers World War Two and German soldiers coming into their village. 'We'd been warned by our retreating soldiers that they would be coming. So we hid in the trenches with dry bread in cloth bags. At dawn, they were in our streets, with their horses and machinery, crossing our gardens with machine guns. But there was no mass shelling like there is now,"" she said. ""Back in the day, I could run away. Now I'm old. I can't anymore."" ""Here's what I'll tell you, there is nothing good about war,"" Lidiya said. ""After the last war [World War Two] what were we left with?"" The shelling frightens her, but she is unwilling to leave the home she's lived in for most of her life. Prior to Russia's invasion of Crimea in 2014, the three-way border crossing would be opened and a unity festival would be celebrated at the point where the countries meet, where a monument dedicated to the friendship between them called ""Three Sisters"" still stands. 'It was a beautiful festival. We, the Russians, the Belarusians would celebrate together. People from all over, important dignitaries would all come,"" she said. Lidiya's late husband was Belarusian. ""The three countries were friends for years, we visited each other, married each other. Now it's over."" Families and friendships spread across borders have been divided, both in thought and in distance. After 2014, crossing the border became harder for people on all sides. Now, it's impossible. Mykhaylo Dudko's two brothers, a sister, nephews and nieces live in Russia. He hasn't met his family in years. Now, he's unable to understand them. ""My sister told me it was us who started the war. But we had no such intention. It was Russia which invaded us. I want my family to use their heads, to look at the situation independently,"" he said. Nina Malenok said she's stopped talking to her brother who lives in Belarus. ""He says it's America who attacked you, and you blame Russia. He's just five miles away across the border, and he doesn't believe what's really happening,"" she said. "" I want to cross him out of my life because of that."" "

At least five people were killed and 18 wounded in Russian strikes in the Vinnytsia region, according to Ukrainian officials. The railways are also used by civilians moving between cities or attempting to flee conflict zones. Earlier this month some 50 civilians - many of them trying to evacuate to safer locations - were killed by a Russian rocket attack on the railway station in Kramatorsk. Elsewhere on Monday, plans for a humanitarian corridor to let civilians leave the siege at the steelworks in Mariupol failed to come together. Moscow said there would be a ceasefire around the plant in the early afternoon but Ukraine's deputy prime minister said no agreement had been reached and that Russia was acting unilaterally. US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin said America wanted to see Russia ""weakened"" so it no longer posed a threat to other nations. He was speaking in Poland a day after he and US Secretary of State Antony Blinken met Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in Kyiv. The US announced an additional $713m (£559m) of military aid to the Ukrainian government and 15 other allied European governments. The BBC's defence correspondent Jonathan Beale says Mr Austin's words highlight America's growing involvement in the war in Ukraine. Russia's ambassador in Washington said Moscow had sent a diplomatic note demanding an end to the US supply of weapons to Ukraine. The city of Mariupol is now almost under full Russian control, and civilians who want to escape often find themselves in ""filtration camps"", where they remain before being evacuated. The BBC has heard chilling stories of the conditions inside the camps, and of what happens to people suspected by Russian authorities of having links to the Ukrainian military or government. ""It was like a true concentration camp,"" 49-year-old Oleksandr said. He was speaking to the BBC after escaping Russian-controlled territory and travelling to Lviv in western Ukraine. Ukrainian forces have been holding the line against Russian-backed separatists in Donbas since 2014 but what was sporadic fighting has now turned into a full-blown war. ""It's become much harder,"" Lieutenant Denys Gordeev told the BBC's Jonathan Beale. ""We have bomb attacks, rocket attacks every day, all the time, every hour."" After its retreat from Kyiv three weeks ago, Russia has refocused its military efforts in Eastern Ukraine with its goal of taking the whole of the Donbas region. Last week the Wimbledon tennis championship announced that Russian and Belarusian players would be barred from taking part in the tournament. It is the latest in a long list of sporting events and governing bodies to impose restrictions on Russian teams or individuals, regardless of whether or not they have links to the Russian government. But how likely is it that sanctions like this could influence Russia to end its invasion of Ukraine? In this piece, BBC World Service reporter and cricket historian Mo Allie considers the history of sporting sanctions, particularly how they helped to end apartheid in his homeland South Africa. "
518,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-61217528,2022-04-25T19:00:23,Ukraine: Facing the Russian Army on the front line in Donbas," Ukrainian forces have been holding the line in Donbas since 2014, against Russian-backed separatists. They're still holding the line, but what was sporadic fighting has now turned into a full-blown war. Lieutenant Denys Gordeev is used to war, but not like this. ""It's become much harder,"" he says. ""We have bomb attacks, rocket attacks every day, all the time, every hour."" Though he has spent eight years battling Russian-backed separatists in the Donbas, now he and his men are facing the full might of the Russian army. After its retreat from Kyiv three weeks ago, Russia has refocused its military efforts in Eastern Ukraine - with its goal of taking the whole of the Donbas region. It has redeployed many of its units to the east. Western officials estimate that Russia now has about 76 Battalion Tactical Groups in the region - each of which has about 800 men. They also say there's some evidence Russia's been addressing some of its early mistakes, helped by the fact they're now fighting on fewer fronts, and under a unified command. The result is that Ukrainian forces are struggling to hold a 300-mile front in the Donbas. They've already lost ground to the Russians and are likely to lose more in the days ahead. Russian forces have been conducting probing attacks to find weak points in Ukraine's defences. So far they've been gaining ground around the city of Izium in the north, and around Severedonetsk and Popasna to the east. The attacks are coming from multiple directions, though as yet there's been no major Russian breakthrough. Lt Gordeev says he and his men are experiencing the effects. The day before we visited, one of his men was killed and another five wounded. It's just a fraction of the casualties Ukrainian forces are now taking every day, though there are no official figures. We tried to visit a field hospital nearby but were told they were too busy. So is this the big Russian surge that has been widely forecast? Or is this just a prelude to such an onslaught? It's not clear. For now the invading army is mostly using its artillery and rockets to grind down Ukraine's defences. Some military analysts expect a major assault is still to come. And Ukrainian forces, including Lt Gordeev and his unit, appear to be holding the line, although Western experts say they are already outnumbered three to one. They also concede that Ukraine will probably have to trade space and ground in open areas to defend key cities where the Russians will find it more difficult to fight. I was allowed to visit Lt Gordeev's forward position during a brief lull in the fighting. They've built a religious shrine at a command post. They're praying for victory. But it's not the place for contemplation or peace. You could still hear the regular blast of artillery. On the short walk to his trench line, he tells me mortar and sniper fire are constant threats. Their closest position is within 600m of Russian forces. The landscape is mostly wide open countryside. Tree lines provide some cover but we're close enough to hear the occasional burst of small arms fire. The Russians ""are coming and coming and coming into territory of Ukraine. And we don't know when they will stop. We don't know when their journey ends,"" says Lt Gordeev. He was a lawyer before he joined the Ukrainian army. One day he hopes he can return to that life. But for now, he says, he's focused on winning this war. Down in the trenches, out of sight of the enemy, the mood is more relaxed, though the tired faces of soldiers clearly show the strains of recent fighting. They show us some of the weapons they've been using - a DschK Soviet heavy machine gun, still used in conflicts around the world, and a variety of rocket-propelled grenades. It's mostly older Soviet-era kit. but also they proudly show off their one British-made and supplied anti-tank missile - a NLAW (Next generation Light Anti-tank Weapon). One of Lt Gordeev's men was trained in how to use it by British troops just before the war started. They've already employed it to destroy a Russian tank, they say. ""We need these weapons,"" says Lt Gordeev repeatedly. Russia, he says, is a ""military state"" - in contrast, Ukraine's ability to keep its own weapons flowing has been severely damaged. What the West supplies, or does not, will heavily influence the outcome of this war. And Lt Gordeev says the morale of his troops remains high. They're fighting for their homeland. But President Putin wants and needs something he can call a win, and soon - possibly by 9 May for Russia's victory day parade. Ukraine may have time on its side - but only if the flow of Western weapons continues and if they can hold back the expected Russian onslaught. "

Manufacturer Venari Group is transforming dozens of vehicles at its two factories in Goole and Brighouse. The firm said the vehicles provided ""ballistic protection from small arms fire on the front line"" and could carry more casualties. The ambulances were also equipped with run-flat tyres, it said. According to Venari, Ukraine is losing ambulances at a rate of 10 per day. Company spokesperson Emma Eastwood said: ""These vehicles are going into war zones because standard ambulances that shouldn't be shot at are being taken out at every point."" Production began earlier this month after the firm was contacted by Andrew Percy, Conservative MP for Brigg and Goole, and staff at the Ukrainian embassy. Fourteen of the Yorkshire-built ambulances have since arrived in Lviv. ""To think the design for these ambulances didn't exist until a few weeks ago - all of that has been achieved through force of will here by all of the guys on the ground,"" Mr Percy said. Venari Group CEO Oliver North said: ""As the UK's oldest and largest ambulance builder, we truly feel it is our duty to deliver on this project, with as much passion, precision, and speed as we possibly can."" Funding for the project has come from a number of wealthy Ukrainian businessmen and UK-based blue chip organisations. Follow BBC East Yorkshire and Lincolnshire on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.

Ukraine can still win the war if given the right support, he added. He also announced the US would allocate an extra $713m (£559m) of military aid to Ukraine and other European nations. Russian President Vladimir Putin has accused the West of attempting to ""split Russian society and destroy Russia from within"". Mr Austin, a retired four-star general, was speaking after meeting Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky in Kyiv. Also involving Secretary of State Antony Blinken, the visit marked the highest-level trip to Ukraine by US officials since the invasion began over two months ago. The meeting between the US and Ukrainian parties, which ran for over three hours, comes as Russia escalates its military campaign in the south and east of the country. At a news conference in Poland after the visit, Mr Austin told reporters the US wants to see ""Russia weakened to the degree that it can't do the kinds of things that it has done in invading Ukraine"". The Pentagon chief added that US officials still believed Ukraine could win the conflict with ""the right equipment"" and the ""right support"". BBC diplomatic correspondent James Landale observed that Mr Austin's comments calling for a weakened Russia were unusually strong for a US defence secretary. It is one thing to help Ukraine resist Russian aggression, it is quite another to speak of weakening Russia's capabilities, he said. Mr Putin's accusations of the West attempting to ""destroy Russia"", made during a speech on Monday, appeared to be in response to Mr Austin's comments. US defence officials said of the millions announced in fresh military funding, nearly $332m (£260m) would be allocated to Ukraine. It brings the total US security assistance provided to Ukraine since the invasion began to more than $3.7bn (£2.9bn). Mr Zelensky has been pleading with Western leaders to increase the flow of military equipment for weeks, vowing that his forces can overcome Russia's military if provided with fighter jets and other vehicles. Last week the US confirmed it had supplied Ukrainian troops with howitzer artillery cannons and anti-artillery radars for the first time. Russia's ambassador in Washington said Moscow had sent a diplomatic note demanding an end to the US supply of weapons to Ukraine. Mr Blinken announced some US diplomatic staff would start to return to Ukraine from next week. They are expected to be based in Lviv initially, with a longer-term plan to re-open the US Embassy in the capital, Kyiv. President Joe Biden intends to nominate Bridget Brink, a career diplomat, as US ambassador to Ukraine - a post that has remained vacant for more than two years. Mr Blinken also defended America's diplomatic approach, telling reporters that the Western alliance the Biden administration had assembled had put pressure on President Putin's government. ""The strategy that we've put in place, massive support for Ukraine, massive pressure against Russia, solidarity with more than 30 countries engaged in these efforts, is having real results,"" Mr Blinken said. ""And we're seeing that when it comes to Russia's war aims, Russia is failing, Ukraine is succeeding."" ""A sovereign, independent Ukraine will be around a lot longer than Vladimir Putin's on the scene,"" Mr Blinken added. Speaking following the meeting, Mr Zelensky said his government appreciated ""the unprecedented assistance"" from Washington and added that he ""would like to thank President Biden personally and on behalf of the entire Ukrainian people for his leadership in supporting Ukraine"". President Biden's always made clear that the US won't directly intervene in the war in Ukraine. He won't be sending American troops to join the battle. But the truth is that the US is getting more deeply involved - and that's been highlighted by the words of the US defence secretary. America has dramatically increased the supply of weapons to Ukraine in recent weeks. Despite Russian warnings, it's made clear it'll be sending more. Mr Austin's words underline that America is not a bystander in this war. America wants to see Russia defeated. More than that, it wants to see Russia's military machine reduced to such an extent that it will not be able to threaten any another European ally in the future. The fear, shared by Nato allies, is that any kind of defeat for Ukraine will only embolden President Putin's ambitions. Mr Austin has now set out clearly that the US has its own strategic goals for this war - even if it's theoretically not participating. The goal is to stop President Putin and to weaken Russia's military to such an extent that it will no longer be able to threaten other nations. To some extent that's already happened. Military experts already believe it will take years for Russia to recover from its military losses. That might also send a signal to another nation which the US is increasingly concerned about - namely China. For President Putin it's more evidence that he's not just in a war with Ukraine. No doubt it will feed his own narrative for the purposes of domestic support. He's long portrayed Nato as a threat to Russia. In recent days Russia has refocussed its advance on Ukraine's eastern Donbas region and US sources believe that Moscow has committed over 76 battalion tactical groups inside Ukraine. On Monday, the UK's ministry of defence said in an update that Moscow had made minor advances in the region but had ""yet to achieve a breakthrough"" because of logistical issues. The update said: ""Ukraine's defence of Mariupol has also exhausted many Russian units and reduced their combat effectiveness."" Have you been affected by what is happening in Ukraine?

The service donated two engines and a hydraulic platform which were among 21 vehicles that left Kent last week. The vehicles would ""help support Ukraine firefighters who continue to protect their communities"", Cheshire Fire and Rescue Service said. It shared a video on social media of the arrival on the Polish-Ukrainian border being clapped by firefighters. The convoy was the second of donated fire engines and equipment to leave the UK under the project led by UK charity Fire Aid and supported by the Home Office. The National Fire Chiefs Council (NFCC) said services across the country had donated equipment which had been requested from Ukraine fire crews as they ""continue their life-saving work in the most difficult conditions imaginable"". Some Ukrainian firefighters have died trying to protect communities and about 250 engines and 100 stations have been destroyed in the war, the NFCC said. The Cheshire service said nine firefighters and officers had delivered the vehicles along with hundreds of pieces of surplus equipment, including helmets and hose reels. The vehicles are no longer in use by the service, which is sending two more engines next month. They also sent a video of a Ukrainian-speaking firefighter explaining how to use the hydraulic platform. Mark Cashin, Cheshire's chief fire officer, said they were proud to offer support and their thoughts were with Ukrainian firefighters. Follow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

522,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-61178099,2022-04-25T13:18:46,Ukraine: 'My disabled nephew has a home in UK – but is stuck in Paris'," A disabled teenager and his grandparents have been waiting in Paris for more than six weeks while their UK asylum application is processed. They told the BBC they are stuck in limbo, spending thousands of pounds on accommodation. When Kateryna Karpenko persuaded her parents and nephew to leave Ukraine after Russian shells started falling, she thought it would not take long for them to join her in the UK. Staff at the UK visa centre in Paris then said it would take a maximum of five working days for their paperwork to be processed and for asylum to be granted. Six weeks on, they are still waiting. ""It kind of turned into a couple more days, couple more days, and now we're over a month,"" Kateryna says. ""They had to go through a lot, fleeing Ukraine, and they have no idea what's happening with our home, our family, our lives."" Her parents Oleksandr and Vira Karpenko fled their home in Irpin with their grandson Nikita Shepel after the Russian regime bombed Oleksandr's workplace. The town on the outskirts of Kyiv was the centre of a key battle for the capital and heavily shelled by Russian forces before they were repelled. Kateryna, who has lived in the UK for almost 10 years, says she promised to take care of them until they were able to return home, in return for knowing they were safe. Her nephew's parents stayed behind in a relatively safe area, but they wanted him to leave Ukraine to enable him to get medical care for a condition he has had since childhood. The war meant he could no longer get health check-ups there. Other cars on the road were being shot at while the trio fled. It took over a day for them to cross the border into Poland as so many others were also trying to leave. ""That was a sense of panic,"" Kateryna says. ""So I wish I could give them that calm and the knowledge that we're all together as part of our family here in the UK. Instead they're stuck in this state of limbo."" She was waiting for them in Krakow, Poland, when her parents and 19-year-old nephew arrived. There, they faced a two-week wait for an appointment to process the mandatory biometrics application. The family decided it would be best to apply for UK asylum from Paris, where they could get an appointment within days. So they packed their belongings into two suitcases and drove for 22 hours to the French capital, where they remain. Kateryna then had to return to the UK. The UK Home Office has been accused of a chaotic and overly-bureaucratic response to the Ukrainian refugee crisis. At the beginning of March, it launched a family visa scheme for Ukrainians who have an immediate or extended family member in the UK. It then launched the Homes for Ukraine scheme, under which people in the UK can nominate an individual or family to stay with them rent-free for at least six months. Figures released by the UK government on Thursday 21 April showed a total of 71,800 visas had been issued under the two schemes. But, as of Monday 18 April, just 21,600 Ukrainians had arrived in the UK, according to figures from the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities and the Home Office. EU countries are allowing Ukrainian refugees in for up to three years without a visa and more than four million people have fled to neighbouring countries since the Russian invasion. Home Secretary Priti Patel has insisted ""security and biometric checks"" were vital to keep British citizens safe. Kateryna's family applied for the family scheme on 9 March and submitted their applications and biometric passports at the UK visa centre on 11 March. They have received no update and, because of the uncertainty of the length of their stay, Kateryna has been unable to arrange stable accommodation. Some friends in Paris have housed them for a few nights, but otherwise she has been looking for short-term AirBnBs, which is costing her thousands of pounds. ""It may seem like very small things because, you know, there's a war going on in Ukraine, but they have to check out from the flat at 11am, and the next place would only allow them to move in at 3pm. So they would have to wait around, even if it's rain or something, they have to find a place with a couple of their bags to stay until they can check in."" Kateryna feels frustrated that after their traumatic experience, she cannot tell them they are now safely in their second home. ""I qualify as a sponsor, I already have a place for them to stay, I can support them. All it takes is just for them to be able to physically cross the border, which is so, so close."" Kateryna says she has tried to access medical care for her nephew in France, but without identity papers they cannot proceed. Typically in Ukraine, he would see someone once a month to monitor his condition. ""I promised my sister, his mother, that I would take care of him. And I feel like I'm failing on that right now. So of course, it worries me."" She is also unable to arrange care in the UK as she can't say when he will arrive. Kateryna visited her family in Paris at Easter and speaks to them each day, but is frustrated by her lack of ability to help. ""I'm living here. I've been living here for the past 10 years. And I feel like, I can't do anything to get my family over here. So I feel sad and helpless, about what's going on."" From Paris, Nikita told the BBC, ""I know that I need medical care, and I can't get it in France. That's why I know I need support in England."" He says the situation makes him feel bad. ""I don't know, what do I need to do? I don't know French at all. And my grandparents don't know the language too and they can't go to the shop to buy something. And we went to visa at the embassy more than five times and we can't get the answer. That's why we can stay only in the flat and wait for an answer from the embassy."" Kateryna says the British people have offered so much support and it was clear the public was open to Ukrainians coming to the UK. ""The people who want to come, they're fleeing from actual horror in their home countries, they're not coming here in search for something. They're just looking for refuge. ""So the ability to expedite the process, and for them to find some stability would mean a world to them, because of what they went through."" A government spokesperson has said it had launched one of the ""fastest and biggest visa schemes in UK history"" following the invasion and that ""changes the Home Office has made to streamline the visa system, including simplifying the forms and boosting staff numbers, are working"".

The Woodhall Spa 1940s Festival, which features parades and re-enactments, is scheduled to take place in July. Up to 45,000 people visit the festival every year, with the organising committee due to make a decision on this year's event on Wednesday. People are being asked to share their views via an online survey. In a statement on social media, organisers said: ""Given the current situation in the Ukraine, [we] would like to know your view on whether you think it is appropriate to go ahead with our celebration of the 1940s Homefront wartime-themed event this year. ""While we examine all the considerations and work towards a decision, we would appreciate your view,"" it added. The move was met with a mixed reaction. One local business owner told BBC Radio Lincolnshire she believed it should go ahead. ""Personally, I don't see the 40s weekend as a celebration of the war - it's more about the resilience of the people... during that time. ""It's an historic era - the clothing, the vehicles - the way of life was so different then and it's nice to have that reminder,"" she said. Another said: ""How can we reflect on the end of war, and celebrate peace in Europe, when there is no peace?"" Last month, The Lincolnshire Wolds Railway took the decision to cancel its 1940s weekend. Spokesperson Matt Riley said it was felt it would be ""insensitive"". North Yorkshire Moors Railway (NYMR) also cancelled its event planned for October. Chris Price, NYMR chief executive, said it would be wrong to hold the event when people in Ukraine faced a ""tense, dangerous and distressing"" time.

Nicole, 21, and Vira, 27, fled to the relative safety of Kyiv last month, with Vira's five-year-old son. The sisters described missiles flying over their heads as they made their way across open land. ""We had to lie down on the ground, then get up, take a few steps, lie down and repeat it all over again,"" Nicole said. The southern port city of Mariupol has seen weeks of intense fighting between Russian and Ukrainian forces. The sisters described constant bombardment. Their neighbours house was obliterated by a Russian bomb, and a bullet was fired through their window. Nicole said that as the attacks increased, it was difficult to get outside for food and water. ""Then, on 1 March, the facilities were turned off, so people were left with no running water, no electricity, no heating,"" Vira added. One day, while fetching fresh water, they saw four dead bodies by a stream and knew they had to escape. They planned a route, but it was a perilous journey. Footage captured by the sisters during their escape shows empty streets littered with destroyed buildings and vehicles, a constant rumble of explosions vibrating in the distance Nicole said: ""In an open area, we had to lie on the ground while all sorts of missiles and shells were flying over our heads. ""We couldn't stay there so we had to get up, take a few steps, lie down and repeat it all over again until we reached a safer place."" As they passed one house, they spotted a sniper. ""He was watching us and waving. It was very dangerous,"" Nicole said. Helped by others, they finally made it to Kyiv. But they remain worried for the people they have left behind in Mariupol. ""The war is still going on there, and they are struggling,"" Nicole said. ""The only way to end this horror is to stop discussing the problem and start taking action."" They hope their work with charity United with Ukraine will help those left behind. The organisation, led by Charlie Cawsey, 25, from Kent, has sent out more than £1m worth of medical supplies to the war-torn country. However, Mr Cawsey said bureaucracy meant things were moving too slowly. ""We need to get people to wake up to reality and speed up,"" he said.

525,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-61208404,2022-04-25T11:58:38,'You can't imagine the conditions' - Accounts emerge of Russian detention camps," ""You can't imagine how horrible the conditions were."" Oleksandr and Olena are two of the lucky few who recently managed to escape from Mariupol, which is now almost under full Russian control after weeks of bombardment. The city is effectively sealed off from the world, and information about what is happening inside is difficult to confirm independently. But the pair, and others, have given chilling accounts of life in Russia's so-called filtration camps, set up outside Mariupol to house civilians before they are evacuated. Oleksandr and Olena, speaking from the relatively safe western city of Lviv, say they ended up at one of the centres when they tried to escape the city. After walking from their home to an evacuation point, they were driven to a Russian refugee hub at a former school in the village of Nikolske, north-west of Mariupol. ""It was like a true concentration camp,"" Oleksandr, 49, says. The centres have been compared by Ukrainian officials to those used during Russia's war in Chechnya, when thousands of Chechens were brutally interrogated and many disappeared. Oleksandr and Olena were fingerprinted, photographed from all sides, and interrogated for several hours by Russian security officers - ""like in a prison"", he says. They worried that the Russians would look at their phones, and so they cleared all evidence from their devices of anything to do with Ukraine - including photos of their daughter in front of a Ukrainian flag. They were right to worry. Oleksandr says that during their interrogation, Russian security officers examined photographs, phone call history and contact numbers on their devices for links with journalists or government and military officials. ""If a person was suspected of being a 'Ukrainian Nazi', they took them to Donetsk for further investigation or murder,"" says Oleksandr, although the BBC has not been able to verify this claim. ""It was very dangerous and risky. Any small doubt, any small resistance - and they could take you to the basements for interrogation and torture. Everybody was afraid to be taken to Donetsk."" President Vladimir Putin has stated one of the aims of his invasion is to clear Ukraine of Nazis, and Russian propaganda has made numerous baseless allegations that Ukraine is somehow aligned with Nazism. Eventually the pair were detained and put on a list for evacuation. But the ordeal did not stop there. Elderly people slept in corridors without mattresses or blankets, Olena says. There was only one toilet and one sink for thousands of people. Dysentery soon began to spread. ""There was no way to wash or clean,"" she says. ""It smelt extremely awful."" Soap and disinfectant ran out on the second day they were there. Soon, too, did toilet paper and sanitary pads. Olena and Oleksandr were told they had permission to leave on the 148th evacuation bus. But a week later, just 20 buses had left the facility. In contrast, there were many buses organised to go to Russian territory. Authorities even tried to force the couple on to a coach heading east, they say. In the end Olena and Oleksandr felt compelled to seek the help of private drivers, who they feared could be Russians or collaborators. ""We didn't have any choice - either be forcibly deported to Russia or risk it with these private drivers,"" Olena says. It's a dilemma that Mariupol's mayor, Vadym Boychenko, recognises. ""Many buses of civilians go to Russian rather than Ukrainian territory,"" he told the BBC, over the phone. ""From the beginning of war, [the Russians] didn't allow any way to evacuate civilians. It's a direct military order to kill civilians,"" he claimed. Oleksandr and Olena's driver managed to get them from their filtration camp to the Russian-occupied city of Berdyansk - through ""fields, dirt roads, narrow pathways behind all the checkpoints"", Olena says, because they didn't have the proper documents to pass a Russian inspection. They then spent three days looking for a route out before finding another driver who was willing to risk everything to get them to Ukrainian-controlled territory. He managed to get around 12 Russian checkpoints and safely deliver them to Zaporizhzhia. The couple then took an overnight train to Lviv. ""From filtration camps you can only escape using these risky local private drivers,"" Oleksandr says. ""Fortunately, there are good people among them."" Arriving in Lviv on the same day were Valentyna and her husband Evgeniy. They also managed to flee Mariupol last week. They were boarding a coach to a smaller city in western Ukraine - desperate for safety after their ordeal. The situation in Mariupol, they said, had become dire. They survived by sheltering in a basement, living of tinned goods, a handful of potatoes they grew in their garden, and water taken from the boiler. The filtration process was speedy for them, says Valentyna, 58, perhaps because of their age and because Evgeniy has a disability. But it was far worse for younger people, she said. ""The filtration camps are like ghettos,"" she says. ""Russians divide people into groups. Those who were suspected of having connections with the Ukrainian army, territorial defence, journalists, workers from the government - it's very dangerous for them. They take those people to prisons to Donetsk, torture them."" She and Evgeniy also say many were sent from the filtration camps to Russia. Sometimes people were told they were destined for Ukrainian-controlled territory, they say, only for the coach to head to Russian-held territory instead. Like Oleksandr and Olena, Valentyna says it was only because of their driver that they managed to escape. ""When we finally [escaped] and saw the Ukrainian fighters and the flag, when we heard Ukrainian language, everyone in the bus started to cry,"" she said. ""It was just unbelievable that we stayed alive and finally fled from hell."" Both couples have now escaped Mariupol, a city that has become a symbol of the resistance and the suffering of Ukraine after the Russian invasion. Now they face an uncertain future - just four of the 11 million Ukrainians displaced by the conflict. ""The city does not exist anymore,"" Valentyna says. ""Even walls. Just huge piles of ruins. I could never have imagined such violence."" "

Nataliia Kolodii, from Maidenhead, Berkshire, is now caring for 15-year-old Viktor after he fled to Poland alone from his home in Kyiv. He has started school in the UK but their parents and grandmother remain in the city as war rages. Ms Kolodii said it was ""impossible to explain"" how she feels. Their parents made a ""spontaneous"" decision to allow Viktor to leave the Ukrainian capital after the war started but ""didn't know where he was going or with whom he was travelling"", Ms Kolodii said. He crossed the Polish border for Warsaw with strangers who pretended he was their nephew. And after staying with relatives in the Polish capital, he eventually travelled to the UK when Ms Kolodii, 37, secured a visa for him. She said Viktor has settled into life in Berkshire and has now started school and making friends. They keep in contact with their parents and her grandmother by sending them videos of them in and around Maidenhead. She said: ""Showing the simple things makes a huge difference. ""They're locked in a box, in a house, watching the news to find out the situation but I think by sending videos, it makes them feel different, [it shows] a different reality, from a normal, peaceful world."" Ms Kolodii told BBC Radio Berkshire: ""Every day I call my parents and, thank God, there's no bombing any more but I used to hear it all the time and while I was talking to Mum. ""Even during the conversation, I feared they would be the last words she would say. The bombing was very, very loud. ""I would hear it on the phone and sometimes we talked and Mum would say 'wait' because there was bombing and she tried to listen if something was coming, to explode. ""I'm happy they don't hear that any more."" Follow BBC South on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram. Send your story ideas to south.newsonline@bbc.co.uk. "

Gracie Cooper, of Beaminster-based Little Toller Books, and Kevin Duffy, of Bluemoose Books in Hebden Bridge, are behind the Packed With Hope scheme. They devised the packs and arranged for them to be driven in four lorries to the border with Romania. Mrs Cooper said the experience was ""bittersweet and very humbling"". As well as books, the rucksacks contained toys, hats, scarves and letters written by UK children. They were put together by 250 volunteers at a warehouse in Dorchester in Dorset earlier this month. Mr Duffy, who returned to West Yorkshire on Friday, said the delivery gave the children ""glimpses of joy in a bleak future"". He travelled with Mrs Cooper to Siret in Romania on Monday, where they began handing out the backpacks to refugees with charity Te Aud Romania (I Hear You Romania). Luke Simon and Zoe Fox, from charity School in a Bag, and two Ukrainian friends of Mrs Cooper, who had fled their country in mid-March, accompanied them. Mrs Cooper said: ""My life has been changed so much by this campaign. ""I am going to be continuing my work with refugees and books, I can't go back to being the same publisher as I was seven weeks ago."" She is also working with Hewlett Packard on the publication of a book printed in Ukrainian, which is also being distributed with the backpacks. Describing the experience, Mr Duffy said he was struck by the fact there were several generations of women, but no men as they had stayed in Ukraine to fight. The team managed to fundraise £80,000 in three weeks to pay for the project, which he said was ""emotionally very demanding"". Mr Duffy said: ""We were seeing pictures of families fleeing to Poland, Germany and Romania, and we just thought if we could get some books over there, and the children could be read a story before they go to sleep, if that eased them into some semblance of normality, wouldn't that be a good thing? ""We are desperate to do something. ""There were lots of parents who were breaking down in tears and giving you hugs. ""Seeing the children pulling the books out, little glimpses of joy in quite a bleak future, that was nice to see. "" Follow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

528,https://www.bbc.com/news/60867414,2022-04-25T01:42:32,Ukraine war: False TikTok videos draw millions of views," TikTok has emerged as one of the leading platforms for snappy false videos about the war in Ukraine which are reaching millions. With a user base of more than one billion people - more than half of whom are under 30 - TikTok is where many young people have been getting updates about the conflict, as the platform struggles to stem the flow of misleading information. And you don't need to look that hard to find dubious content. According to an investigation by NewsGuard, a website that monitors online misinformation, new users could be recommended false content about Ukraine within 40 minutes of joining the network. While platforms such as Facebook, Instagram and Twitter have been labelling false or misleading viral videos about the war, TikTok seems to be playing catch-up. The company insists it has stepped up its efforts to combat misinformation. Here are some of the most common categories of misleading content the BBC has identified on the platform. From the early days of the war, fake livestreams have drawn some of the highest numbers of views on TikTok. The recipe is simple: a user finds a dramatic video of an old conflict or some military drill, dubs fake audio of a huge explosion or an intense shootout, starts a livestream, and once a sizeable audience tunes in, asks for donations to their channel. One such account had drawn nearly 30 million views by mid-March. All but three of the account's livestreams up to that point were short clips taken from a YouTube video of old Ukrainian military training, dating from 2017. At one point, a fake audio track of gunshots became so popular that it appeared in more than 13,000 videos. Users can react to livestreams by sending the accounts points that can be converted into cash. ""It seems like a lot of the looped scary livestreams were likely created with the hopes of earning money via TikTok's gifting system,"" says Abbie Richards, an independent researcher who creates videos with a focus on the dangers of misinformation. Most of the fake livestreams can be easily found under popular hashtags such as #Ukraine or #UkraineWar. ""The content is intended to blend in with all the other information available on the topic,"" says Ms Richards. Dramatic footage of military video games or computer-generated imagery (CGI) has been regularly used as a substitute for real war videos. Scenes from video games such as Arma 3 and Call of Duty have flooded TikTok. Fake aerial battles, including footage appearing to show fighter jets being shot down, have proved particularly popular. Some accounts try to make the action more realistic and use clips from war films, TV series or real-life games. One video, which was viewed 24 million times, shows a man appearing to drop an explosive item on a tank. It was taken from a video of an Airsoft match - a team combat game similar to paintball - and uploaded to YouTube in January. A separate fake livestream, viewed by 2.3 million users, is made up of CGI footage of missile strikes and has been circulating on the internet since last year. Ms Richards says she has seen instances of users warning in the comments section of such videos that they are taken from video games or are made up. But the people behind the accounts can disable comments - and the warnings disappear. Videos of old conflicts are typically used when a new one is under way. The BBC has seen videos from wars in Libya, Syria and Chechnya being used as though they show the current conflict. A video purporting to show intense fighting between Russian and Ukrainian forces outside a block of flats has racked up 7.7 million views. But the footage was in fact recorded in 2014 in the Chechen capital, Grozny, during a deadly attack by an armed jihadist group. Fake breaking news and live captions were overlaid on the original footage to hide the real source. Some have posted videos from the conflict between Russia and Ukraine in 2014, which could easily be mistaken for the current one, or footage of military exercises or parades in either country. A video of a column of Ukrainian tanks in central Kyiv was presented as if they were on their way to defend the capital against a Russian offensive. It received nine million views. But it was filmed during an independence-day military parade several years ago. And a video of a tank with a Ukrainian flag, speeding down a residential street - viewed four million times - also dated back to the Russia-Ukraine conflict of 2014. Ms Richards says TikTok could address the problem of viral old videos by taking simple measures, such as making the date a video was posted clearer. Like Facebook and Instagram parent Meta, TikTok collaborates with independent fact-checkers, albeit on a smaller scale. But while Facebook and Instagram have been labelling false and misleading content about Ukraine on their platforms, such labels are rare on TikTok. Unlike some of its rivals, TikTok does not provide transparency or analytics tools to academics, researchers and journalists, which Ms Richards says misinformation experts like her have been ""desperately"" demanding for some time. What that means for independent fact-checkers is a time-consuming process of manually researching a huge volume of content on a regular basis. Another issue, according to Ms Richards, is the absence of a community of TikTok users willing to debunk falsehoods on the platform. ""When TikTok fails to ensure the accuracy of information receiving millions of views on its platform, that burden is falling on outside researchers and everyday TikTok users."" A TikTok spokesperson told the BBC: ""We continue to respond to the devastating war in Ukraine with increased safety and security resources to detect emerging threats and remove harmful misinformation. ""To support our efforts to help keep TikTok a safe and authentic place, we've added more resources to our moderation and fact-checking for content in Russian and Ukrainian, including local language experts and partnerships with independent fact-checking organisations.""

At the entrance to his block of flats he screamed at police to let him inside the burning building. When he reached his flat, he found the bodies of his wife and her mother, killed by a Russian missile that had ripped into the lower floors of the block. The body of his three-month-old baby Kira was discovered later; he saw it for the first time when he returned to the flat on Sunday. The deaths - three generations of a single family - have sparked outrage and revulsion in Ukraine, a country already hardened by two months of war. Commenting on the strikes, President Volodymyr Zelensky was visibly upset when speaking about baby Kira's killing. ""How did she threaten Russia? It seems that killing children is just a new national idea of the Russian Federation,"" Mr Zelensky said in his nightly address to Ukrainians. He described those who had planned and carried out the attack as ""bastards"". Five others were also killed in the missile strike. Yuriy was in the wrecked building on Sunday to find what he could salvage from the apartment. Photo albums, his wife's sugar sachet collection, handwritten notes. He found his baby's stroller in pieces. ""If I leave things in the flat, it will become garbage and people will throw it away,"" he told the BBC. ""I want to keep it for my memories."" He and Valeria had been a couple for nine years. ""She could find joy in everything. Odesa was her favourite city. She worked in PR and she could communicate with a lot of people, understand them. I admired what a good writer she was,"" he said. ""She was a great mother, friend, with all the best qualities. It will be impossible for me to find somebody else like Valeria. She was perfect. Such a person could be given to you only once in a life and it's a gift from God."" Kira had been born at the end of January, just a month before the start of the war. A few weeks after that, Valeria had posted on Instagram that she was living with ""a new level of happiness"" after the birth of her first child. ""Our girl is one month old now,"" she wrote. ""It has been the best 40 weeks."" Yuriy showed us photos of Kira on his phone sent to him by his wife. ""We were so happy when she was born,"" he says. ""I was in the maternity hospital when she gave birth. It's very hard for me to realise now that my daughter and wife are no longer here. All my world was destroyed yesterday by a Russian missile."" He wants the world to know about what happened to his family. ""What is happening is a grief for my family, for our city, for Ukraine, it's a grief for the whole civilisation. I hope our story helps to stop this war."" As we leave, he hands us some nappies in a carrier bag, one of the few things he's been able to recover from the flat. ""Please take them,"" he tells us. ""Give them to charity. I have no need for them now."" Have you been affected by what is happening in Ukraine? Or do you have any questions about the conflict? Email us at: haveyoursay@bbc.co.uk.

Mr Corbyn was suspended from Labour in 2020 over his response to a report into anti-Semitism in its ranks. But while he was reinstated as a Labour member, Sir Keir refused to let him return to the party's backbenches. Last week, the former leader suggested Nato be disbanded to ""bring peace"". Mr Corbyn - a long-standing critic of the transatlantic military alliance - said while he accepted the group was not going to be scrapped immediately, people should re-examine it after the conflict in Ukraine ends. He told Times Radio: ""Do military alliances bring peace? Or do they actually encourage each other and build up to a greater danger? ""I don't blame Nato for the fact that Russia has invaded Ukraine. What I say is look at the thing historically, and look at the process that could happen at the end of the Ukraine war."" Mr Corbyn also described the choice to remove the Labour whip from him as a ""totally unjustified decision"". Asked whether his predecessor could be readmitted to the parliamentary party after his comments, Sir Keir told the BBC's Sunday Morning programme: ""It is very difficult to see how that situation can now be resolved."" He added: ""[Mr Corbyn] lost the whip because of his response to the Equalities and Human Rights Commission in relation to anti-Semitism, but I made it very clear, the first thing I said as party leader was that I was going to tear out anti-Semitism by its roots in our party. ""I've also made it clear that our position in the Labour Party is not to accept the false equivalence between Russian aggression and the acts of Nato."" The current Labour leader insisted the party's stance under both his leadership and Mr Corbyn's was pro-Nato and that was not going to change. Mr Corbyn remains in the Commons, sitting as an independent MP for Islington North. "

Gillian Randlesome is hoping to host Nataliya Hevak's family - including her disabled son - in her home in Lanark. But she said the visa process was taking too long for a family with a vulnerable child. The UK government said 21,600 Ukrainians had already arrived. Nataliya, husband Liubomyr, and their children fear for their safety in their Lviv home, which until recently had been safe from Russian attacks. A missile attack on the western city early this week left at least seven people dead, city officials said. Residents have been told to use air-raid bunkers but Nataliya's family cannot get into them because her son, Levko, 13, uses a wheelchair. The eldest of three children, he was born with muscular dystrophy, a disease that causes weakness and loss of muscle mass. The family instead take refuge in a central area of their own building, where they hope they will be safe. ""My neighbours and friends take their kids ands they go to those bomb shelters, we can't do this because it's impossible to get Levko there,"" Nataliya said. Nataliya signed up for the UK's Homes for Ukraine scheme soon after the Russian invasion at the end of February. She met Gillian online through a friend in Scotland nearly two months ago. Gillian had hoped their visa application would be fast-tracked because of Levko's disability. She said the process was complicated and took too long for a family with a vulnerable child. ""I think it put immense stress and pressure on them and I definitely felt more pressure to try and help,"" she added. The rooms the family will have in Lanark have been made ready by Gillian, while the visa process and travel arrangements are finalised. The UK government said almost 72,000 visas have been granted with 21,600 Ukrainians already arrived in the UK. A spokesperson said: ""We are processing thousands of visas a day - this shows the changes we made to streamline the service are working. ""We'll continue to build on this success so we can speed up the process even further."" "

Holly King-Mand, 38, from Bedfordshire, said she first offered free passes to her regular classes for refugees and was ""overwhelmed"" by interest. As a result she has set up a bespoke class to help the refugees learn to listen to, talk and write English. ""I hope I can - in some small way - help,"" she said. The former secondary school teacher already has 55 families registered which she estimates could mean helping about 100 children between the ages of five and 15, some of whom have not yet arrived in the UK, but who want to improve their English before they get here, she said. Ms King-Mand, from Leighton Buzzard, had been on maternity leave and was yet to return to the classroom when the first coronavirus lockdown started in March 2020. She began hosting free 30-minute lessons on Facebook from her home to support parents home-schooling children all over the world. The popularity of her classes saw her initial 74 Facebook followers rise to about 60,000 across three social media platforms and this wide reach has continued, leading to her latest response. She now does one-to-one tutoring and online workshops but has always offered free classes to disadvantaged children. But the level of interest in her offer to help Ukrainian youngsters led her to something different. ""It became clear that I needed to create something special, suited to the needs of children who had just arrived in the country or could be about to,"" she said. The classes, which start on 30 April, will be a ""combination of images and demonstrations, mostly centred on confidence building and talking English"", she added. The teacher said she will not be using Ukrainian at all because she wants to ""create an immersive learning experience"", but the instructions about how to join will be translated. ""I feel really privileged to be in a position to be able to attract that many people and to be able to help them,"" she said. ""I'm really looking forward to meeting the children and in the past two years I've learnt it's entirely possible to build relationships through online lessons."" Rhianon Lucas and her son Wilfred, 10, are hosting Natalya and her ten-year-old son Illia who arrived at their home in Slaithwaite, West Yorkshire from Kyiv, via Warsaw and Dublin, a couple of weeks ago after an ""arduous"" three-week wait for visas. She said she ""signed Illia up immediately"" because she found that while her ""amazing"" local authority had processes in place to support adults with English, there was ""no specific language tuition for children"". ""As we are in an area of very small village primary schools it's going to be very challenging to get much language teaching for Illia in school, so we have been on the look-out for other types of support,"" she said. ""Natalya's English is excellent, and she's really keen that Illia's English improves quickly - he is due to go up to high school in September, so we want to ensure he is best-placed to have a good start there."" Ms King-Mand has also enlisted 10 of her regulars as her English Learning Ambassadors or ""teaching assistants"". They are students who she has built a relationship with and ""trusts them to come into the classes to help"". One of them, 12-year-old Eloise who lives near Letchworth in Hertfordshire, joined Holly's first ever Facebook live lesson in March 2020 and has continued to learn with her. She said she was ""very proud"" to be able to ""help people who have been through so much over the past few months"". ""I think these classes are an amazing idea of Holly's as it will really help refugees settle into our country by being able to communicate with us better,"" she said. ""It is incredible that these classes will be able to help them catch up on the vital education that they must've missed over these horrifying few months."" Harriet, 11, from West Chiltington, in West Sussex has also been learning with Holly from the start and said she was ""happy to help"" Ukrainian children and was also ""excited to get to know them and talk about our different lives and cultures"". ""I've seen the distress that Ukrainian families on the news have been going through and it can make me feel a little helpless at times,"" she said, ""so I feel as if this is a way that I can help them, even though it's not much, I hope it will make a difference."" ""I feel that the lessons aren't just to learn English but that they will also help all the children understand that they are not alone and that British children will welcome them,"" she added. Ms King-Mand said she had not set an end date for the classes but feels they will run ""certainly for the rest of the year"". ""I'll have to see what it becomes because these hare-brained schemes of mine tend to evolve,"" she said. ""I want to make sure good things like this still happen, I accidentally gained this platform and even though I'm also weaving a business from it, I always want to make sure to use it for this kind of thing.""

But that didn't stop him from helping to save the leg of a man who'd been caught by a blast in the war-ravaged country. Oleksandr, the doctor who actually carried out the operation, had never performed the tricky procedure before. But a little over a week previously he had watched Prof Nott demonstrate how it was done inside a Ukrainian hospital. And so Oleksandr took a photo of the wound with his smartphone and sent it to Prof Nott, who had recently flown back to the UK. The experienced British war surgeon confirmed the operation was necessary. He'd also previously given Oleksandr a video talking him through how it was done. ""I was quite nervous and it was slowly, step-by-step surgery, but it went well thanks to David Nott,"" Oleksandr says. Prof Nott, who was born in Carmarthen in west Wales, has previously worked in conflict zones including Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria. Fortunately for Oleksandr and his patient, the consultant surgeon at St Mary's Hospital in London had made Ukraine the latest destination in his mission to train doctors how to treat war wounds. Russia's tactics of bombarding and shelling cities means Ukraine's hospitals are currently seeing many blast injuries. ""It is the worst possible way of attacking the opposition, by simply shelling,"" says Prof Nott, in his first interview since returning from Ukraine. ""It causes enormous damage. It causes dreadful, dreadful injuries."" These include shrapnel wounds to soft tissue, bones and limbs. Even just the shockwave of such a blast can do huge damage, he says. The ""blast wind"" in its wake is capable of amputating limbs. Being thrown against buildings can cause traumatic injuries, too. Barotrauma - physical injury caused by changes in pressure during an explosion - is a particular concern because of Russia's use of thermobaric weapons, also known as vacuum bombs. These can cause bleeds on the brain and in the lungs, causing victims to cough up blood. They are also capable of bursting ear drums and perforating bowels. While he says he has been all over Ukraine - ""north, east, south-east, west"" - Prof Nott does not want to talk about the specific hospitals or areas he has visited for fear that Russian forces will target them - and for the same reason, the BBC is not using Oleksandr's full name or location. During the war in Syria, he used a Skype connection from his office in London to assist with an operation in Aleppo - only for the hospital to be bombed a few days later. He has spoken about how he will never know if the two were connected. Now Prof Nott says 115 hospitals in Ukraine have already been shelled by Russia. ""Blowing up hospitals and killing doctors is a real weapon of war too, it's just despicable,"" he says. While he was in Ukraine, Prof Nott brought as many doctors as possible into operating theatres to watch him carry out operations on warzone injuries, including filling holes in limbs, grafting skin and covering exposed bones. But the mission, a combined venture between his own David Nott Foundation and the humanitarian group UOSSM International, did not end when he left the country as he would soon end up advising Oleksandr remotely before the complicated leg operation. This involved taking a flap of skin from behind the patient's knee to close a wound and prevent infection getting into the exposed bone. ""They are very difficult operations, they are not easy and they go wrong and cause problems,"" Prof Nott says. But despite these challenges, the result was ""miraculous"", he says. ""It worked really well."" For Oleksandr's part, he says it was important to have the advice of someone with practical experience of the operation: ""It's a relief to us when he tells us it will be OK."" He is full of praise for Prof Nott, who he says has ""showed us ordinary doctors how to fight on the medical frontline"". Oleksandr says knowing how to carry out these types of procedure is ""very necessary in our situation"" because there are so many shelling injuries and open fractures that need to be treated. Prof Nott, through his charity the David Nott Foundation, has translated a series of slides and videos on how to treat war wounds into Ukrainian ""which went on as many of the doctors' phones as it possibly could"". He also hopes those like Oleksandr that he has taught will pass on what they have learned. ""He will train other people how to do it, they'll train other people to do it and then hopefully everyone will know how to do it in the not-too-distant future,"" Prof Nott says. Unfortunately, it seems the demand for these skills in Ukraine will not go away any time soon. Earlier this month, Ukraine's foreign minister said the battles in the eastern Donbas region would resemble World War Two, with the use of ""thousands of tanks, armoured vehicles, planes, artillery"". To Prof Nott, the scenes coming out of cities like Mariupol are reminiscent of what he previously witnessed in Aleppo. ""It's exactly the same as Syria, exactly the same tactics,"" he says. ""Aleppo, when I was there by 2016, was completely flattened, the whole place was completely and utterly destroyed."" Oleksandr says he is now treating ""awful injuries"" that he had hoped never to see. ""We would like to treat normal trauma, like grannies and grandpas who need joint replacements, common fractures,"" he says. But he adds: ""We are doing our job day by day and whatever happens we will stay at home and do what we should do."" "

But soon her story was hijacked by pro-Kremlin accounts, including one promoted by the Russian Foreign Ministry, which falsely accused her of being a fake. ""There was no whistle, rustling or sound of shelling,"" Tania says. ""It just hit the building and suddenly everything went dark. The building collapsed."" Tania was caught up in an air strike in early March. She was helping sort clothes for a humanitarian aid drive in school number 21 in Chernihiv, north of Kyiv, when a missile hit the building. Although authorities did not name the school, the BBC was able to confirm the specific building via images posted on the Telegram social media app. Local authorities reported at the time that Russian aircraft had hit two schools that day, leaving nine people dead and four injured. Tania was knocked out by the blast. She says when she regained consciousness, she realised she was alive and could walk. She stood up, looked around and saw people in a state of panic. She also noticed bodies lying on the floor, including that of a woman who had been standing next to her just minutes before the strike. Scared, she fled to her home. There, she posted a video on Instagram - still covered in blood and with visible injuries on her face - in which she explained what had happened. ""I was at school number 21 when the explosion happened,"" she says in the clip. ""I survived. Good luck to everyone. I hope you are luckier than me. ""Why am I recording this story? It's just that there were many children at that school. I don't know whether they have survived. Just send this video to all your Russian friends."" In a matter of hours, her video went viral in Ukraine. The clip garnered tens of thousands of views on Instagram alone, and was picked up by a number of Ukrainian news websites. Tania told the BBC that she had acquired thousands of new followers and received dozens of messages on Instagram - some supportive, some threatening. People from Russia were among those who wrote to her. Some of them apologised for the actions of the Russian authorities. But others did not believe her story and called her ""fake"". Soon Tania's friends started sending her screenshots from Russian and Belarusian media outlets, in which her video was described as a fabrication. These reports described her as a ""pupil"", claimed that the wound on her face was not real, and alleged the blood on her face did not look natural and that she was behaving too ""normally"" for a person who had just survived a bombing. The claims were false. Tania is no ""pupil"" - she is 29 years old and worked as a waitress before the invasion started. Pictures she took of herself on the second day after the attack - shared with the BBC - clearly show facial injuries consistent with the footage she posted on Instagram. As for her seemingly calm composure, Tania told the BBC that she was in ""deep shock"" when she recorded the video. ""I was calm and wasn't scared. Just shocked,"" she says. ""A few hours after that, I was in hysterics. For the next two days, I couldn't eat or sleep, I just cried. It was a nightmare."" Some Russian reports also claimed schools across Ukraine stopped operating at the beginning of the invasion, and claimed there could not have been many children in the school at the time of the strike. But the school was being used as a collection point for humanitarian aid and considered a safe place by local residents, Tania says, some of whom had brought their children there. Officials confirmed that account. Vyacheslav Chaus, the head of the Chernihiv regional state administration, told us the school's basement was open so that local civilians could hide in case of shelling. Tania is one of a number of Ukrainian civilians who have been falsely accused by Russian media outlets - and even the Russian government - of somehow faking attacks. Among the key sources spreading false claims about Tania was an account called War on Fakes, whose ""debunk"" of her video has so far been viewed more than 400,000 times on Telegram. Promoted by the Russian Foreign Ministry and embassies on social media, it is a multilingual ""fact-checking"" project that claims to provide ""unbiased information about what is happening in Ukraine"". While some of its fact-checks are genuine, it includes false information such as the allegations against Tania. And its content repeats Moscow's talking points on the war: claims that Ukraine is the aggressor, that Ukrainians are committing widespread war crimes, and that any evidence of Russian wrongdoing is fabricated. Stories either attributed to War on Fakes or echoing its arguments have appeared in pro-Kremlin communities on Russian social network VK, a number of regional Russian media outlets, at least one news agency and Belarusian state TV. Tania says she felt not anger but sadness when she saw the false claims about herself circulating online. ""I felt sad and sorry for these people who believe all these lies. They are so scared to admit this war is real and all these things are happening, so it's easier for them to find excuses or reasons not to believe in it or call my story a fake. It's easier for them to believe that Ukraine is a theatre and Ukrainians are actors."" She has left Ukraine for Poland. She now has a scar on her face. Her eyesight was damaged by the bombing and she says she's suffering from post-traumatic stress. ""I have flashbacks of the attack even when I'm in Poland,"" she says. ""Frankly, I don't think I'm ready to go back home."" "

Women and children in a crowded room can be heard saying they are running out of food and water, and pleading to be evacuated. Some say they have seen no daylight for weeks, having been there from February. The BBC has not verified the video, believed to have been filmed on 21 April. Meanwhile, officials in the devastated city say a planned evacuation of civilians did not happen on Saturday. Later on Saturday Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky held a news conference in a Kyiv metro station. He repeated his call for he and President Putin to meet. And he warned that peace talks with Russia would be off if Russia killed the last remaining Ukrainian defenders in Mariupol or carried out a so-called independence referendum in areas it has captured such as the city of Kherson. Also in Mariupol, video footage has emerged showing the bodies of more than 20 civilians lying along a main road. The graphic videos, posted on social media in recent days, come as the United Nations has confirmed that it is investigating hundreds of allegations of killing of civilians during the invasion of Ukraine. The city has been the scene of weeks of intense fighting between Russian and Ukrainian forces. At least eight people, including a three-month-old baby, have died after Russian missile strikes in the major port city of Odesa, President Zelensky says. Odesa has been shelled before by Russian forces, but much less than other cities such as Mariupol. Caroline Davies was at the scene and spoke to one man outside the apartment block, who said he had been in his parents' apartment on the 12th floor when there was a huge explosion. Read more of Caroline's report here. Russia later confirmed it had carried out strikes in the area. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson spoke to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Saturday afternoon. and confirmed the UK would be providing more defensive military aid, including protected mobility vehicles, drones and anti-tank weapons. President Zelensky thanked the prime minister for the training of Ukrainian military personnel currently taking place in the UK.

Russian forces are occupying towns, threatening journalists and demanding they spread pro-Kremlin views. Those who refuse are forced to close down their operations. The strategy to replace Ukrainian media with pro-Kremlin press coverage includes capturing transmitter towers and switching off access to national Ukrainian news programmes in areas controlled by Russian forces. Instead, signals for pro-Russian broadcasts are switched on. The State Special Communications Service of Ukraine told the BBC that eight stations are being used to air ""propaganda and disinformation"" to the local population in southern Ukraine.

Boris Johnson told Mr Zelensky more armoured vehicles, drones and anti-tank weapons would be sent to Ukraine, a Downing Street spokesman said. Mr Zelensky thanked the PM for the training of more than 20 Ukrainian troops who arrived in the UK last week. Ukraine was invaded by Russia two months ago this weekend. Mr Johnson also confirmed the UK would be reopening its embassy in Kyiv next week, a move first announced yesterday. The No 10 spokesman said this was a demonstration of ""our support and solidarity with the Ukrainian people"". The Ukrainian soldiers receiving training in the UK are being instructed on how to use 120 armoured vehicles that will be supplied to the resistance effort against Moscow, the government has said. President Zelensky updated Mr Johnson on the situation in the Donbas, where Russia has been concentrating its military efforts in recent days. Both leaders condemned ongoing attacks by Russian forces against civilian targets, including in Mariupol, Odessa and Lviv. The prime minister told Mr Zelensky Russia would be held to account for its actions and that the UK government was helping to collect evidence of war crimes. He also updated the president on new UK sanctions against members of the Russian military, Downing Street said. The two leaders discussed how the UK would work with partners to develop a long-term security solution for Ukraine and spoke about discussions taking place with other nations and groups to provide further financial support, including at a G7 finance ministers' meeting last Wednesday. They also agreed on the importance of establishing a ceasefire and humanitarian corridor to allow civilians to leave the besieged Ukrainian city of Mariupol. The talks came as Ukrainian officials said Russian forces had started attacking a steel plant in the battered port city, in an apparent bid to eliminate the last stand by Ukrainian defenders. An estimated 1,000 civilians remain sheltered in the Azovstal plant alongside the remaining 2,000 fighters. President Zelensky and Russian leader Vladimir Putin are both due to meet United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres in the coming week, with the long-awaited prospect of a humanitarian corridor to allow people to leave Mariupol expected to be on the agenda. In a news conference in a Kyiv metro station later on Saturday, Mr Zelensky said he was ""satisfied"" with the level of military support coming from the UK. ""We want more than we're being given, but we're satisfied,"" he told reporters. ""We cannot refuse or reject anything during the war from the biggest military aid, which is coming from the United States and the United Kingdom. ""There are many other friends in Europe, but I'm talking about volumes of help and I'm grateful for it."" "

Women and children in a crowded room can be heard saying they are running out of food and water, and pleading to be evacuated from the southern city. Some say they have seen no daylight for weeks, having been there from February. The BBC has not verified the video, believed to be filmed on 21 April. On the same day, President Vladimir Putin called off a planned Russian assault on the steelworks, and ordered his troops to seal it off instead. Moscow also declared itself to be in full control of the strategic city - a claim denied by Ukraine, who says Russian troops were simply unable to seize the Azovstal steelworks. The plant - a maze of tunnels and workshops - is a huge industrial site in central Mariupol. Taking the Sea of Azov port - which has been almost erased by weeks of heavy Russian bombardment - is a key Kremlin war aim, and would release more troops to join an ongoing Russian offensive in the eastern Donbas region. The footage was posted online on 23 April. The Azov regiment, which was originally a far-right group that was later incorporated into Ukraine's National Guard, says it shows its fighters delivering food and other aid to women and children in one of the Azovstal underground bunkers. Big signs reading ""Children"" in red paint are seen on the walls leading to the room. One woman, who is not named, is heard saying more than 15 children - from babies to those aged 14 - are sheltering there. Another unnamed woman is seen on camera telling how she has been sheltering since 25 February - the second day of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. One of the children, a girl, says she left her house together with her mother and grandmother on 27 February. ""We haven't seen the sky or the sun since. We want to get out of here very much. We want it to be safe for us, so no-one is hurt, and then live in safety."" The girl says she wants to be able to go to the western Ukrainian city of Lviv, where one of her brothers has managed to escape to from Kharkiv - a heavily-bombed city in the north-east. ""I want to get out… to be in safety. I don't want to risk getting out only to be hit by bomb fragments, for example,"" she adds. Weaving deep through what the battalion say is the Azovstal steelwork tunnels, the video shows an underground rabbit warren, filled with families and young children. It is difficult to verify the video, but if accurate it is a rare glimpse of life in the Azovstal plant and a final push by the Azov regiment to ensure that the situation in Mariupol is at the forefront of global attention as the Russian army seal it off. The Russian media have portrayed their brutal campaign in Mariupol as a way to ""de-Nazify and demilitarise"" Ukraine. This video has been released to replace that image with one of fear and desperation in the eyes of children who say they've not seen the sun in one-and-a-half months, asking to be evacuated. This video is an attempt to control the narrative about what is happening on the ground. The Azov regiment is controversial; it was originally a far-right group. This video shows them as approachable warriors, fist-bumping children and bringing them supplies, while other images on social media show Russian soldiers standing outside burning buildings and Russian tanks rolling through the city. Earlier this week, one of the commanders of Azov told the BBC that many civilians, including children, were sheltering at the site. He also said dead Ukrainian fighters were there. The Azov regiment was formed in 2014, soon after Russia annexed Ukraine's southern Crimea peninsula, to fight against Russian forces and pro-Russian rebels in the eastern Donbas region. Some of Azov fighters originally had links to nationalist and far-right groups. The regiment was later incorporated into Ukraine's National Guard. The regiment, along with a Marine brigade, border guards and police officers, are now the last Ukrainian defenders left in Mariupol. "

The Charity Commission has launched an inquiry into the charities of Viateschlav Kantor, a billionaire sanctioned by the UK over Ukraine. Mr Kantor donated £9m to King Edward VII's Hospital in London. One of Prince Charles's charities, The Prince's Foundation, had also been promised £3m. The Russian-born billionaire had been made a ""life governor"" of the private hospital in Marylebone, of which the Queen is patron. But Mr Kantor has stepped down from that role and as a trustee of the hospital, which is known for its links to royalty. The King Edward VII recently opened the ""Kantor Medical Centre"", a new wing built with Mr Kantor's support, but in the wake of the sanctions, his name has been removed. Donations were paid through the Kantor Charitable Foundation, whose bank accounts have now been frozen by the charity regulator. The Charity Commission inquiry will decide whether Mr Kantor's charities - the Kantor Charitable Foundation, the Kantor Foundation and the World Holocaust Forum Foundation - can continue to operate. ""We are committed to protecting the integrity of the charitable sector and are clear that an individual sanctioned in the UK cannot act as a trustee,"" said Tim Hopkins, Charity Commission assistant director. A King Edward VII's Hospital spokesman said: ""In the light of the difficult position [Mr Kantor] now finds himself in, he has decided to step back completely from all charitable activity in the UK."" The spokesman said the action was ""out of respect for the important and valuable work of the many charities he has supported"" and that Mr Kantor had agreed that his name would no longer be attached to these projects. Mr Kantor's charity also made donations to The Prince's Foundation, an education and training charity set up by the Prince of Wales. Charity records show £600,000 was paid to the foundation over two years, as part of a pledge for £3m, intended to be paid in stages until 2028. Mr Kantor's charity remains listed as a patron of the foundation. The Prince's Foundation says it won't comment on individual donations, but it is understood that donors would have been subject to a process of due diligence, based on what was known at the time. Among other causes supported by the sanctioned oligarch were the Thrombosis Research Institute, the Royal Society of Medicine, the Anna Freud Centre and the Royal Opera House. Earlier this month Mr Kantor was added to the list of oligarchs facing UK government sanctions over the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Mr Kantor was described by the UK government as the ""largest shareholder of fertiliser company Acron, with vital strategic significance for the Russian government"". Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said when announcing the further sanctions: ""We are showing the Russian elite that they cannot wash their hands of the atrocities committed on Putin's orders."" A 2020 report on Russian influence, by Parliament's Intelligence and Security Committee, had warned of UK charities being ""willing beneficiaries of Russian money"" and enabling a ""reputation-laundering process"".

Chris Garrett, from Peel on the Isle of Man, is volunteering and working with the Ukrainian National Guard. He previously helped in the country between 2014 and 2017, but returned when war broke out in February. The 38-year-old said: ""I've been here before, I've had the shelling, I've had the shooting. I've had some pretty close calls in the country."" ""I'm used to how they're laying the mines here, I'm used to how people are dealing with them as well,"" he added. While he had worked in the country clearing mines in the past, he said he was now put to better use training other people. ""I could go onto the contact line now and clear land mines... but I'm just one person,"" Mr Garrett said. He said he was able to help many more people by ""taking groups of 10, 20, 30, 50 guys at a time and teaching them basic awareness"". Mr Garrett said many people arriving to fight in Ukraine had never experienced a war zone like it. He said: ""Unless they've been to Syria, they've probably never had artillery thrown at them for more than maybe one or two rounds, they definitely have not had sustained hour-long artillery fire thrown at them, they've probably never had tanks firing at them."" As a result he said he had met people who had gone to the front line had ""left very quickly"". The 38-year-old said in an ""ideal world"" there would be a ceasefire and the ""fighting would stop immediately"", but he believed the war would continue for a long time and the impact of it would last for ""decades"".

Tatyana Safronova and 14-year-old Serhii are finding their feet far from Dnipro with Tony and Helen Erwood. They were among the first Ukrainian refugees to be flown to Scotland after being granted visas. A grateful Tatyana said: ""I really hope that we will soon be back to Ukraine, and will dream that we will live our usual life."" Her partner Oleksandr urged them to leave after the Russian invasion. ""He told me that we should leave the city,"" she said. ""He said he would feel more comfortable serving in the army if he knew that we were safe."" They arrived in Scotland at the end of March, and flew to Shetland on 3 April to meet their hosts. The pilot gave them a hug when they landed and told them they were safe. Tatyana, through an interpreter, told BBC Radio Shetland: ""In Ukraine we had to leave our entire lives in the city of Dnipro, my partner remained, he serves in the army. ""We had to leave our cat, and all our friends and relatives. Many have gone to serve in the army."" Tony explained: ""We saw pictures on TV and it's just almost unbelievable, I never thought we'd see things like that in our lifetime. It was just horrific. ""We see all these people trying desperately to get out of Ukraine and we thought we have got space here and we could provide accommodation for some people."" Helen said that if it happened to them they would want somebody to offer ""sanctuary and kindness"". She said: ""I am old enough to be Tatyana's mum and Serhii's granny - sort of surrogate grandparents in a way, looking after them. ""We feel very strongly that we have a duty of care, to protect their privacy, to allow them the freedom to grow, to do whatever they want here, to learn about our culture. ""And we are, very badly, learning a bit of Ukrainian as we go. ""Also introducing them to foods they haven't had - pickled onions have been a revelation, and potato waffles."" Tony laughed: ""When Tatyana and Serhii arrived in the UK the first meal they wanted was fish and chips - which they got."" Helen said the Shetland weather and driving conditions had been a challenge. Speaking on the BBC's Good Morning Scotland, she said: ""It's been so cold since they got here, winds that cut through you, they're not used to it. ""And explaining to Tatyana when she's driving - she's learning to drive one of our cars - that she's got to park into the wind, otherwise you might damage the doors. She's never come across that before. ""I think for her personally single-track roads have been quite a challenge, particularly where there are sheep wandering about."" Tatyana said the local community had been fantastic. Serhii is settling in and has just started secondary school. She said: ""Serhii behaves like a typical teenager, he spends a lot of time at the computer and on the phone. ""But he spends his time also walking around the island with great interest, studying the nature. ""I hope that the time spent at the local school will do him some good, and he will improve his English."" During World War 2 Tony and Helen's house was a base for ferrying agents, resistance fighters and refugees between occupied Norway and Shetland. More than 75 years on it is once again a sanctuary for those seeking refuge. Helen said: ""It gave hope to the Norwegians, and I think it's very poetic in a way that we're trying to give hope to Ukrainians here again. ""One or two people have said it's completely fitting that they should be staying here."" The hosts said Tatyana and Serhii had ""joined the family"", but hoped it would not be too long before they could visit them when they were back in Ukraine. Helen said: ""We want to help them rebuild their lives."" "

Ella Lambert, 22, from Chelmsford, Essex, said in a matter of days 1,000 disposable sanitary products had been handed out to refugees in Warsaw. She was now working to get 1,000 reusable and washable cloth pads, made by volunteers, to Ukrainian hospitals. They were in ""massive need"", she said. The Bristol University student arrived in Warsaw on Monday to help distribute sanitary products as well as arranging for cloth pads to be shipped to Ukraine. In March 2020, she started The Pachamama Project, where volunteers sew reusable cloth sanitary pads for refugees, called Pacha Pads. When the war in Ukraine broke out, her not-for-profit organisation joined up with Pads 4 Refugees to get sanitary products to displaced Ukrainians in an effort to prevent period poverty. So far about 3,000 disposable pads had been sent to Lviv, Ukraine, she said. Miss Lambert said: ""It's heartbreaking. We've seen thousands of people arriving in shelters not really knowing where they are going next. It's a complete crisis."" She said volunteers and organisations on the ground were ""doing a great job"" but ""they're in desperate need of donations as they're going through 10,000 sanitary packs every four weeks"". She said she was currently working with the Yorghas Foundation to get reusable pads into Ukraine. ""Periods are still seen as a taboo and stigmatised subject. People don't talk about it, but there's a massive need for them. So it's really important that organisations like ours can hand them out,"" Miss Lambert said. ""So even if they don't ask for them, we can still give them to them."" Małgorzata Pikora, a Polish school teacher and volunteer coordinator at the Global Expo centre in Warsaw, said: ""Four thousand Ukrainians are staying at the centre and about two thirds of them are women. ""Every day we find a new home for new families, and new refugees come to replace them. Every day we give several hundred sanitary pads and other hygiene products.""

Maj Gen Rustam Minnekayev was quoted in state media as saying that goal would allow Moscow to form a land bridge to Crimea, which it annexed in 2014. He also said it would give Moscow access to the Russian-backed separatist region of Transnistria in Moldova. Transnistria is a small region that borders Ukraine's west. It is unclear if Gen Minnekayev's comments were officially sanctioned by the Kremlin, but they were widely cited in Russian state media including the Interfax and Tass news agencies. Russian defence officials told the BBC's Steve Rosenberg that they were ""looking into"" the general's comments, which - if confirmed - offer the first insight into Russia's potential plans in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, a senior EU official told Reuters that Russia is likely to intensify its attacks in eastern Ukraine and along the southern coast in the coming days, adding that the next two weeks may be decisive in the war. Moldova has summoned Moscow's ambassador over the comments, which its foreign ministry described as ""deeply concerning"". A small Russian-speaking breakaway region, Transnistria borders Ukraine from the west. It claimed independence after the fall of the Soviet Union in a bloody conflict, but is not recognised internationally and officially remains part of Moldova. A small detachment of around 1,500 Russian troops has been stationed in the region since 1995 as part of a truce agreement. Gen Minnekayev, who is deputy commander of Russia's central military district, was speaking at a military event in the Sverdlovsk region on Friday. ""Control over the south of Ukraine is another way out to Transnistria, where there are also facts of oppression of the Russian-speaking population,"" Gen Minnekayev said. Mr Putin made similar claims, without providing evidence, about alleged discrimination against Russian speakers in Ukraine before launching the invasion on 24 February. Ukraine's defence ministry denounced Gen Minnekayev's comments as Russian ""imperialism"". And the country's President Volodymyr Zelensky responded to them in his regular overnight address. ""The Russian invasion of Ukraine was intended only as a beginning, then they want to capture other countries,"" he claimed. He earlier said Russia was planning on holding a series of sham independence referendums in occupied regions to create a series of pro-Russian breakaway states. ""If they ask you to fill out some questionnaires, leave your passport data somewhere, you should know this is not to help you,"" he warned. ""This is aimed to falsify the so-called referendum on your land if an order comes from Moscow to stage such a show. This is the reality. Be careful."" A spokesperson for the Ukrainian defence ministry said that referendums were planned in Kherson and occupied areas around Zaporizhzhia in the coming weeks. "
548,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-61154066,2022-04-23T00:05:00,Ukraine war: How Russia replaces Ukrainian media with its own," Serhiy Starushko and his journalist colleagues had just finished their morning editorial meeting in early March when Russian military vehicles drew up outside. Within minutes, soldiers stormed through the front doors of the three-storey building, home to a local news station in the occupied Ukrainian port city of Berdyansk. About 50 employees were held hostage for five hours. They had become victims of the real-world fight to control the flow of information. Russian forces are occupying towns, threatening journalists and demanding they spread pro-Kremlin views. Those who refuse are forced to close down their operations. The strategy to replace Ukrainian media with pro-Kremlin press coverage includes capturing transmitter towers and switching off access to national Ukrainian news programmes in areas controlled by Russian forces. Instead, signals for pro-Russian broadcasts are switched on. The State Special Communications Service of Ukraine told the BBC that eight stations are being used to air ""propaganda and disinformation"" to the local population in southern Ukraine. In Berdyansk, Serhiy - a broadcast journalist - was forced to lie on camera and announce he was declaring a war against so-called ''Ukrainian nationalists"". The Russians said they would post this coerced declaration online if he refused to co-operate. ""There were armed people everywhere, a few dozen of them, and I think five to six of them were from the FSB [Russian security service]. They said, 'now it's Russia, and if you want to live, you'll have to co-operate',"" recalls Serhiy, now safely out of the region. For him and his colleagues, ""co-operation"" meant demands to divulge the contacts of local pro-Ukrainian activists and soldiers, and air pro-Russian propaganda. These were not empty threats. ""They took me to a separate room. They started beating me on my head, chest, legs, they were beating me with their knees and palms, so there were fewer bruises,"" he says, recalling the incident. ""Then one of them threatened me with a gun: he held it to my head and genitals. They asked me if I wanted to call my wife to say 'goodbye' to her."" The next day, Russian TV channels showed a video claiming to show the capturing of the station - but the building was already empty when they turned up with cameras. The Russian reporter said the army had to take control of the station because it was spreading ""disinformation about the situation in the city"". It was the last functioning Ukrainian broadcasting company in Berdyansk. Another company was also shut down; national broadcasting has been cut off. Before the invasion, residents in the region could watch dozens of national Ukrainian channels - and a few local ones - but these have since been blocked. Unless they have a satellite dish, citizens in occupied cities now only have access to 24 Russian state TV channels and those channels broadcasting from self-proclaimed republics in eastern Ukraine. ""It's just fake news, I don't even want to watch it. They're brainwashing people,"" says 28-year-old Anna (not her real name), who still lives in Berdyansk. She only watches a music channel and relies on limited access to the internet for reliable news. And now a Crimea-based channel has launched news bulletins for residents in what Russia calls the ""liberated areas"" of the south of Ukraine. There's no mention of a war. Journalists claim ""the life in the region has improved with the arrival of the Russian forces"", and these areas ""have real prospects to get out of the crisis created by the Ukrainian authorities"". ""This is a key part of the Russian strategy. Because information warfare is always a part of a real war,"" explains Natalia Vyhovska, from the Ukrainian Institute of Mass Information. ""They start broadcasting Russian TV, they threaten independent journalists. They come with weapons to their newsrooms, their houses and their parents' houses."" The same tactics were also employed when Crimea was invaded in 2014, according to Reporters Without Borders, an organisation that supports press freedom. But as well as hijacking the airwaves, Russians are producing imposter content - as Mykhailo Kumok, who owns a media company in the southern Ukrainian city of Melitopol, discovered. After the Russian forces took over the city, five armed officers knocked on his door. They confiscated his laptop and computer, and took Mykhailo and his wife to their base - for a ""conversation"". They asked him why his media company called the Russians ""occupiers"". Mykhailo replied, what else should he call them? ""They started talking about so-called 'de-Nazification' and I replied, 'I'm a Jew, I'm a Russian-speaking Jew - so why did you come here? For me, you're nothing but occupiers'."" Mykhailo says he wasn't going to co-operate with the Russians and publish their propaganda, so he decided to shut down both his newspaper and website. But he was shocked when he saw a fake newspaper with his company's branding being delivered to locals. ""That was a fake newspaper with terrible printing, but with our logo. On the first page there was a portrait of the mayor installed by Russia, a small portrait of Putin and a picture showing the occupiers helping those in need."" One of the articles said the Russian authorities would lower gas prices, write off all bank debts and temporarily cancel all tax payments. Unrealistic pledges which echo those made by Russia in annexed Crimea in 2014. ""That time they also promised the residents [they would] write off credit debts, return their savings - but nothing happened,"" says Eugen Fedchenko, chief editor of StopFake, a fact-checking organisation specialising in tackling Russian propaganda and fake news. ""That's why most Ukrainians understand that all these promises are just empty words."" Mykhailo agrees. He is concerned that propaganda such as the fake newspaper may influence older people, but most, he says, will look at what happened when Russian forces invaded Crimea and backed separatist forces in eastern Ukraine in 2014. ""People here won't blindly believe the [Russian] media. First of all, they'll ask themselves, 'has my life become better or worse since the Russian troops invaded?' And life here has certainly become worse - almost for everyone."" "
549,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-61162588,2022-04-22T23:50:12,Mount Everest: Even world's highest peak not immune to the Ukraine war," Ang Sarki Sherpa has one of the most dangerous jobs in the world, but he takes the risks in his stride. Mr Sherpa is one of Nepal's highly experienced mountain guides, known as ""icefall doctors"", who fix ropes and aluminium ladders for climbers on Mount Everest, the world's tallest mountain. The work by the sherpas, who must negotiate crevasses and constantly shifting glacier ice, enables hundreds of mountaineers to attempt Everest from the Nepalese side every year. They start from base camp, where they converge in April and May. Recent years have been blighted by disaster - deadly avalanches on Everest in back-to-back years were followed in 2020 by Covid, which kept climbers away. Now war in Ukraine is denting hopes that visitor numbers will return to pre-pandemic levels. Standing outside his yellow tent at the top of the sprawling base camp, the 50-year-old Mr Sherpa pointed to the vast Khumbu icefall towering above. ""That is one of the danger zones. Lots of crevasses between the snow there. If you are not careful, you might fall into them. Even if you make a trail with ropes it may disappear after a month. It's a risky job,"" he tells the BBC. Mr Sherpa leads a six-member team of local guides, who were acclimatising when the BBC visited. Ropes and ladders were strewn around their tents as they drank tea. Around them base camp was bustling with activity. Advanced teams of various expeditions were setting up tents and organising supplies as the spring season got under way. The ""icefall doctors"" identify the safest route and fix ropes up to Camp One and Two. Another team undertakes the work further above and all the way to the summit. Mr Sherpa and his colleagues are only too aware of the dangers involved. An avalanche above the Khumbu icefall killed 16 sherpas while they were fixing ropes in 2014. A year later, 19 people were killed in an avalanche triggered by a massive earthquake which devastated swathes of Nepal. Mountaineering in the Everest region has been hit hard by the pandemic. This season the sherpas were looking for things to pick up - then Russia invaded Ukraine. ""Because of that war we hear that a number of teams from that region have cancelled their plans. So, we may not have that many expeditions this year,"" Mr Sherpa tells me. Base camp is not just for those hoping to reach the 8,848m Everest summit. The hike to the camp, nearly 5,400m above sea level, attracts tens of thousands of people from around the world each year. It can take up to two weeks to complete the trek starting from the town of Lukla, the gateway to the Everest region. After Covid struck in 2020, Nepal allowed mountaineers on Everest in 2021 and issued 408 permits to summit. This year, the Nepal tourism ministry had issued only 287 climbing permits by 19 April. ""The war has affected mountaineers coming from Russia and Ukraine this year. We have only one Ukrainian climber for Everest so far,"" says Surya Prasad Upadhyay, the director of the mountaineering division at the country's tourism department. Seventeen Russians have been issued Everest climbing permits - others have cancelled. Russians have been affected by a collapse in the value of their currency, the rouble, and difficulties accessing currency abroad after international sanctions targeted their economy following the invasion. Small villages all the way up to base camp are a lifeline for thousands of trekkers and mountaineers. Here again, the war in Ukraine has had an impact. ""Fuel and prices went up after the war started. For us they are important to run our business. We hear that the prices might go up further. That's worrying,"" says Ang Dawa Sherpa, who runs the Sherpa Village guest house in the village of Phakding. Nepal's government has increased petrol and diesel prices four times this year so far, making it costlier to bring in supplies. With more and more people wanting to climb Everest in recent years, questions have been asked over whether the climbing routes have become too crowded. A shocking image of hundreds of people waiting in line, practically cheek by jowl, along the snow-covered route in 2019 raised serious questions about safety. The government says it has taken steps to mitigate the situation. ""We are working to address the crowd problem on Everest. Our ministry is working to give longer permits to the mountaineers so that it can help to regulate the expeditions,"" says Maheshwor Neupane, secretary in the ministry of tourism in Kathmandu. Mr Neupane says a five-member team of officials will be deployed at base camp throughout the climbing season to monitor expedition groups. Rubbish left behind by the crowds is also a growing problem. ""It is a cause of concern for us. Up on Everest and other mountains the leftover trash, dead bodies and other waste items are still there,"" Bhumiraj Upadhyaya, chief warden of the Sagarmatha National Park, tells the BBC. ""The Nepali army is now involved in clearing them but it's a difficult process."" At base camp, Ang Sarki Sherpa and his team mates discuss their next day's climb. They know that mountains like Everest are hugely risky places to work - but they also offer a livelihood for people like them and tens of thousands of others in the region.

Speaking via video link, he said ""art can tell the world things that cannot be shared otherwise"". His country's culture is a focus of attention in Venice and artworks have been escorted out of Ukraine by police. In contrast, the Russian Pavilion stood locked and empty; a sign of the country's isolation. President Zelensky described the pain of war as he addressed the world's oldest and most prestigious contemporary art exhibition earlier this week. He offered examples of Ukrainian soldiers finding murdered civilians in Bucha, of medics rescuing injured people in Kharkiv, and of a girl writing a letter to her mother who died in Mariopul as experiences that can be best reflected in art, ""because this is about something beyond words"". As he talked of his country's fight for freedom, he said: ""There are no tyrannies that would not try to limit art. Because they can see the power of art. It is art that conveys feelings."" Ukraine's art is taking centre stage at the Venice Biennale, which has made a space at the heart of the Giardini for what is effectively a temporary pavilion for Ukraine. There is a pile of sandbags, mirroring the sandbags being used in Ukraine to protect artworks, and a scorched structure covered in posters of war-related art work. The official Ukrainian Pavilion in the nearby Arsenale shows a work by artist Pavlo Makov that nearly didn't make it to Venice. Called The Fountain of Exhaustion, it's a series of funnels arranged in a triangle through which water drips and divides. Makov described it to me as a metaphor for ""the exhaustion of humanity, the exhaustion of democracy"". On the day the Russians invaded, with air raid sirens blaring and shelling starting, co-curator Maria Lanko loaded the funnels into the boot of her car and began the long journey out of Ukraine to Venice. Lanko told me ""leaving Kiev was very scary because you could see the fires on the outskirts after the shelling. That was the scariest"". At that point it was unclear if Makov would be joining her in Venice. He lives in Kharkiv, one of the places to come under early Russian assault. He spent time in shelters after ""really intensive bombing of the city"", he says, before leaving with his 92-year-old mother and other family members ""under missile attack... We put five of us in my car, and we just left the city"". Makov is 63. The younger male co-curators of his exhibition had to get special dispensation from the Ukrainian Government to leave the country temporarily to attend the Biennale. The fact they were allowed to - when all men between 18 and 60 are forbidden from leaving - is a sign of the importance the Ukrainian authorities place on cultural representation. In Venice, as journalists from across the world queued to interview them, both Makov and Lanko talked of being cultural ambassadors. They are no longer representing their art as individuals; they are representing a country whose culture is under threat. Makov told me the Russians are continuing what they have tried to do for centuries. ""They want to level and demolish Ukrainian culture totally because Ukraine doesn't exist, it's part of Russia,"" he says. ""They say it openly. The war is a punishment."" At the Zelensky-endorsed exhibition called This is Ukraine: Defending Freedom, I watched Ukrainian artworks being unwrapped by the likes of Maria Primachenko, who has become a symbol of the country's national identity, as well as a beautiful 17th Century icon of the Virgin Mary, believed to be by Stefan Medytsky. These works were transported from Ukraine under police guard. They are now totems for a country that fears its culture will be wiped out. Meanwhile, the Russian Pavilion is shut and empty. The curator and artists who were due to exhibit their work in Venice this year pulled out when the invasion started. The only thing to see when I passed by was a protester, another Russian artist, Vadim Zakharov, who unfolded a poster denouncing the war. In 2013, Zakharov represented his country at its Biennale pavilion. Now he berates Russia for its ""propaganda"" and the ""murder of women, children, people of Ukraine"". He was applauded by some people who stopped to watch. Soon the Italian police arrived and his poster was removed, a far better fate than has befallen artists and other anti-war protesters in Russia. ""If I was in Red Square,"" he said, ""it would be different."" At a time when they are fighting at home, Ukrainian art is taking on special significance in Venice. But Makov told me he finds it almost impossible to think of creating new work after what he witnessed in Kharkiv. He referenced the famous anti-war painting by Picasso, created after the bombing by the Nazis and Italian Fascists of the Basque town of Guernica in 1937. Makov told me that if Picasso had actually been in Guernica during the bombing, he might not have been able to paint the picture. ""Some artists can, but for me, it's very difficult,"" he says. ""Art is an important piece of life, it helps us to create and maintain our culture. But I heard this explosion, I saw the destroyed centre of Kharkiv. You know, art is a modest thing, because the drama of life is always bigger."" As his country fights for its survival, though, Ukrainian works here in Venice have a role to play in revealing the richness of Ukraine's culture, and what there is to lose. "

The defence ministry said one crew member had died and 27 were missing after the sinking, while the remaining 396 had been rescued. Previously it had made no mention of casualties. The BBC cannot independently verify these figures. The sinking of the missile cruiser is one of the defining events of the war in Ukraine so far. Russia says the ship went down because of a fire on board, but Ukraine says it sank it with missiles. And now, the wreckage of the pride of Russia's fleet has been declared an item of Ukrainian underwater cultural heritage, under the category of rare scientific or technical equipment. As the BBC's Joe Inwood reports, Ukraine's Ministry of Defence says the wreck can be admired ""without much diving"". At first glance, life in Russia's capital looks normal, our Russia editor Steve Rosenberg writes. While there are no exploding shells or foreign forces encircling Moscow, there are noticeable changes, says Rosenberg, who has lived there since the early 1990s. There is the lack of independent news, iconic buildings displaying the Latin letter Z - the symbol of Russia's military operation, and the way the war in Ukraine has found its place in Moscow's war museum. ""On the museum's website, the spelling of the word ""museum"" has been altered to feature the letter Z,"" writes our correspondent. ""In the museum shop you can buy Z mugs and badges declaring 'Putin is My PreZident'."" Read Steve Rosenberg's story about the changes in Moscow here. Across Kyiv region, efforts have begun to clear the countless pieces of unexploded ammunition left behind after fierce fighting. The main hospital there says it is receiving more and more patients who have touched or stepped on mines and shells. This is their story. Meanwhile, Kyiv has to maintain its vigilance in case Russian forces try to return to the area. The city's defence force remains on high alert, dug into trenches, and the BBC's Mark Lowen got rare access to the 131st battalion in the forests near the capital. Today, the separatist region of Transnistria in Moldova came into the picture, with a senior Russian general saying Russia aims to seize southern Ukraine and to open a route to the breakaway state, which borders Ukraine. Maj Gen Rustam Minnekayev said Moscow would fight to take ""full control"" over the south in addition to the eastern Donbas region. It is unclear if Gen Minnekayev's comments were officially sanctioned. Russian defence officials told the BBC's Steve Rosenberg that they were ""looking into"" the general's comments, which - if confirmed - offer the first insight into Russia's potential plans in the coming weeks. But they were enough to prompt Moldova to summon its Russian ambassador. Read more about the general's comments here. A small Russian-speaking breakaway region, Transnistria borders Ukraine from the west. It claimed independence after the fall of the Soviet Union in a bloody conflict, but is not recognised internationally and officially remains part of Moldova. A small detachment of around 1,500 Russian troops has been stationed in the region since 1995 as part of a truce agreement. Read more about the strange normality of life in a breakaway state here. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said intelligence assessments suggest there is a ""realistic possibility"" the war will continue until the end of next year, and that Russia could be victorious. He said Russian President Vladimir Putin has ""a huge army"" but ""he has a very difficult political position because he's made a catastrophic blunder"". ""The only option he now has, really, is to continue to try to use his appalling, grinding approach driven by artillery, trying to grind the Ukrainians down,"" Mr Johnson said, speaking from Delhi where he has been holding talks with Indian leader Narendra Modi. Mr Johnson also said the British embassy in Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, will reopen next week, and that the UK is looking at sending tanks to support Poland, as it supplies Ukraine with heavy weaponry.

Aiden Aslin, originally from Newark, Nottinghamshire, was seized by Russian forces during the battle for Mariupol. He appeared, handcuffed, in a video posted on YouTube. Speaking in Parliament on Wednesday, MP Robert Jenrick said the interviewer Graham Phillips was ""in danger of prosecution for war crimes"". During Prime Minister's Questions, Mr Jenrick also called on the online platform to remove the video immediately. He said it showed Mr Aslin ""being interviewed under duress for propaganda purposes"", and claimed that was ""a flagrant breach of the Geneva Conventions"". On Friday, YouTube said it had removed the video following a ""valid privacy complaint"". The firm added it had also taken action against Mr Phillips, saying his account was no longer able to receive money from advertisements. In the 45-minute interview, Mr Phillips claimed Mr Aslin was a ""mercenary"" rather than a prisoner of war, and told him he could face the death penalty. However, Mr Aslin had been serving as a marine in Ukraine's military since before Russia launched its invasion. His family said he had moved to Mykolaiv in 2018 where he met his girlfriend. Responding to the news from YouTube, his mother said she was very relieved, after finding the videos of her son being interviewed in captivity ""horrifying"". ""I'm happy that YouTube have recognised and taken action on removing this."" Angela Wood said. YouTube has also previously blocked channels linked to Russian state media.

Tesco is allowing three items per customer. Waitrose and Morrisons have limited shoppers to two items each. The majority of the UK's sunflower oil comes from Ukraine and disruption to exports has led to some shortages and an increased demand for alternatives. The British Retail Consortium says the restrictions are a temporary measure ""to ensure availability for everyone."" Olive, rapeseed and sunflower oils are included in the limits being put in place by some supermarkets, both in-store and online. Iceland have not yet commented on pictures posted on social media of signs that have appeared in its stores limiting sales of two-litre and five-litre bottles of sunflower oil to one per customer. Meanwhile, a spokesperson for Waitrose said: ""We are closely monitoring the situation and working with our suppliers to ensure customers continue to have a choice of cooking oils."" Grocery expert Ged Futter says shoppers can be reassured that there are plenty of alternatives when it comes to cooking oils. ""We are used to an abundance of varieties, what we may see is that they become more limited,"" he says. But he also warned that sunflower oil may soon be unavailable on the shelves. ""These limits may delay things a bit, but in a couple of months, there won't be any sunflower oil available to buy,"" he suggests. Sainsbury's and Asda are not currently limiting how much cooking oil their customers can buy. A spokesperson for Sainsbury's said: ""We are working closely with our suppliers to make sure customers continue to have cooking oils to choose from including olive oil, vegetable oil and rapeseed oil."" Tom Holder from the British Retail Consortium said that the restrictions being put in place by some supermarkets are a temporary measure, ""to ensure availability for everyone."" He added that ""retailers are working with suppliers to ramp up production of alternative cooking oils, to minimise the impact on consumers."" Analysis by retail research firm Assosia also suggests that the reduced supply of sunflower oil as a result of the conflict in Ukraine is having an impact on prices. It has tracked changes in the average cost of sunflower oil across major retailers including Tesco, Sainsbury's, Asda, Morrisons, Aldi and Lidl. Its data suggests that a one-litre bottle of own-brand sunflower oil has gone up by an average of 12p to £1.26 since January 2022 - an increase of more than 10%. For a five-litre bottle, the increase was 38p or 6%. There had been no change in the average price of a one-litre of own-brand organic sunflower oil, which stood at £3.10. UK food manufacturers that use sunflower oil as an ingredient in their products, such as crisps and oven chips, have also reported concerns over supplies. The Food Standards Agency and Food Standards Scotland have told consumers that some products labelled as containing sunflower oil may in fact contain alternatives such as rapeseed oil, in a move to try and make sure products remain available. They cautioned that anyone with allergies should look out for extra information. "

Stuart Thomas, 43, from Essex, and Neil Spalding, 30, from London, travelled to a refugee centre in Warsaw this month to distribute the ""kindness"" bags. Each contains both toiletries and fun items and are given to children as they get on buses for journeys of up to 40 hours to their next destination. The pair are continuing to raise funds. The idea for the so-called ""kindness backpacks"" came from Marta Szyjkowska, who works at the Warsaw Expo Centre, which has been turned into a relocation centre for women and their children fleeing Ukraine. It caters for thousands of refugees, offering beds, food, clothing, counselling and assistance with onward travel to other parts of Poland or Europe. Mr Thomas, from Stansted Mountfitchet, said: ""Marta came up with the idea that she wanted children, when they're leaving the relocation centres, to have a couple of things. ""She wanted them to have something to do on that bus journey, and she also wants them to feel a moment of kindness - the fact that people really cared about them."" Mr Thomas and Mr Spalding, from Clapton in east London, have so far raised almost £5,000 to fund hundreds of additional backpacks, which cost about £15 each. During their trip to the Warsaw centre they helped put the packs together and distributed almost 500 to children leaving the refuge. Mr Thomas said he was ""just frozen by being so overwhelmed with emotion"" when he first saw the thousands of displaced Ukrainian families, many crying ""uncontrollable tears"". ""I've got two young boys, I've got boys that are 11 and eight, and so a couple of these boys got off the bus together and one of them - my lad plays football all the time - and this lad obviously did as well, he's got all the Adidas sports stuff on and I was like, 'that's just my boy there',"" he said. He said the packs were ""massively appreciated"" both by the children who received them and their parents. ""We're not changing the world and I completely get that, but it's creating small moments of happiness,"" Mr Thomas added. Find BBC News: East of England on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

Speaking to Hardtalk’s Stephen Sackur the dissident businessman said such a measure would cause Mr Putin “to lose over half his revenue” and questioned whether Moscow could continue to wage war in Ukraine after such an impact on the federal budget. Mr Khodorkovsky was once CEO of Russian oil giant Yukos before being jailed for almost a decade on charges of fraud and tax evasion which, he says, were politically motivated.

557,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-61190310,2022-04-22T13:31:02,"Ukraine: UK embassy in Kyiv to reopen next week, says PM"," The British embassy in the Ukrainian capital Kyiv will reopen next week, Boris Johnson has announced. Ambassador Melinda Simmons said she was ""heading back"" after leaving when Russia invaded. The prime minister also said there was a ""realistic possibility"" the Russian bombardment would continue until the end of next year. Mr Johnson added the UK was looking at sending tanks to support Poland as it supplies Ukraine with heavy weaponry. The prime minister made the embassy announcement at a news conference in Delhi, where he has been holding talks with Indian leader Narendra Modi. It comes after Russia withdrew forces from around Kyiv when it failed to seize the capital, and launched an assault on the eastern Donbas region. Mr Johnson visited Kyiv earlier this month to meet President Volodymyr Zelensky, following a pledge to give £100m worth of weapons to Ukraine. Taking questions from reporters, the prime minister said intelligence assessments that the Russian assault could continue to the end of next year, and end with a Russian victory, were plausible. He said Russian President Vladimir Putin has ""a huge army"" but ""he has a very difficult political position because he's made a catastrophic blunder"". Mr Johnson said: ""The only option he now has, really, is to continue to try to use his appalling, grinding approach driven by artillery, trying to grind the Ukrainians down. ""I think no matter what military superiority Vladimir Putin may be able to bring to bear in the next few months, and I agree it could be a long period, he will not be able to conquer the spirit of the Ukrainian people."" The prime minister said he was looking at what the UK could do to ""backfill"" weapons in countries, such as Poland, ""who may want to send heavier weaponry to help defend the Ukrainians"". ""We're looking at sending tanks to Poland to help them, as they send some of their T-72s [tanks] to Ukraine and other steps like that,"" Mr Johnson said. Sending British main battle tanks to Poland, if confirmed, would be a very significant move. As one senior British Army officer put it, it raises the UK's commitment to Ukraine by a further notch but also increases the chances of Britain - and Nato - eventually becoming co-belligerents in this conflict. The tanks, which the Ministry of Defence says would be Challenger 2 main battle tanks, would be intended to ""backfill"" for Poland's T72 tanks, which it is sending directly to Ukraine. There are no plans to send British tanks or crews into action in Ukraine. Until very recently Nato countries have been reluctant to supply heavy weaponry to the Ukrainians for fear of antagonising President Putin and risking an all-out European war that puts Nato forces into direct conflict with Russia. But with each reported Russian atrocity that is revealed, notably in Bucha, these Western inhibitions have melted away. Poland is sending tanks, Slovakia has sent its S300 air defence missiles and the US is sending powerful, long-range 155mm artillery. For Ukraine's army, outnumbered and outgunned in the eastern Donbas region, such help cannot come quickly enough. But President Putin has made no secret of his irritation at Nato's assistance to his enemy and he used this week's test-launch of a nuclear-capable missile to remind the West of Russia's massive arsenal of strategic nuclear weapons. In the long term, Mr Johnson said he believed Western nations would respond to demands from Ukraine to guarantee the country's security against future attacks. He said this would not replicate the Article 5 guarantee for Nato members - in which an attack on one country is treated as an attack on all members. But instead, Western allies would offer pledges to provide weaponry, training and intelligence-sharing, the prime minister said. ""I hope it will enable the Ukrainians to offer deterrents by denial and to make sure their territory is so fortified as to be impregnable in the future to further attack from Russia,"" he said. ""Deterrence by denial"" is a term in military thinking which means seeking to put off an aggressor by making their attack infeasible or unlikely to succeed, rather than through the threat of retaliation. Mr Johnson added that he backed ministers if they chose to visit the embassy. European diplomats have also been returning to the capital. "

Nataliia Andrianova arrived in Liverpool with her daughter Sofia on 11 April after a ""dangerous"" journey from Kyiv following the Russian invasion. The pair are now staying with their sponsor Andrea Cooper, who registered on the Homes for Ukraine scheme. They were invited by Ms Cooper's father to the Leicester match on Wednesday. Before the game, family friend and season ticket holder Bill Chambers told the club about their attendance. Everton then showed the mother and daughter on the big screen alongside a message of welcome, prompting applause and cheers from the crowd. Ukrainian defender Mykolenko also asked to meet the family after the 1-1 draw. Ms Andrianova told BBC Radio Merseyside: ""We had a lovely talk. He was really glad that we are here and we are safe. ""It was an amazing evening and Sofia's first football match at a stadium."" Mykolenko also gave the six-year-old a signed shirt while the club provided a goodie bag. Ms Andrianova said: ""I think we will be Everton fans forever."" She said they spent six days in their basement after the Russian invasion in February but decided to flee after a missile landed nearby. ""The first thought was to save my child and to take my child to a safe life,"" she said. ""The second one was my husband because I knew he would not be allowed to cross the border […] it was very hard to say goodbye to him."" Ms Andrianova said they felt ""very frightened and scared"" as the journey from Kyiv to Poland was ""very dangerous"". She described feeling ""relief"" after arriving in Liverpool, saying: ""Everyone is so welcoming. We really feel at home."" Ms Cooper, who was put in touch with the family through acquaintances in Huyton, said the hosting had ""worked from the very first minute"". ""Natalia and Sofia have brought so much life into my house and so much joy. They have made this house come to life with energy and it's been life-enhancing for me as well,"" she added.

Khaled El Mayet, from Cheltenham, said the medical supplies are vital as babies are being born early due to the shock and stress of the conflict. Two ambulances transporting incubators left for Ukraine on Thursday but Mr El Mayet said many more are needed. ""There are a lot of babies passing away because they don't have vital equipment,"" he said. Mr El Mayet organised for seven decommissioned ambulances to take medical supplies to Ukraine in March. The management consultant said his team of volunteers were told of the need for incubators on their previous aid visit. ""We've had a lot of messages from hospitals in Ukraine,"" he said. ""There are a lot of babies dying because of premature births caused by the shock and stress of the war so now - as well as ambulances - we're desperately trying to get incubators to send out there as well."" Mr El Mayet appealed for anyone with access to incubators to donate them as ""there's not an abundance of them"". ""Trying to find them, that's the problem we have at the moment,"" he said. ""They are expensive - a lot more expensive than an ambulance - so it's just trying to find someone who may know an organisation or hospital, or anyone who makes these. ""We want to get as many as we can, along with related neo-natal medical supplies, so we can help these hospitals to look after premature babies,"" he added. Former The Bill actor Bruce Byron is driving one of the ambulances which left for Ukraine on Thursday. He said he hoped it would make a difference. ""I just want to make sure that we get this stuff down to these poor people who are suffering, they need it,"" he said. ""It shouldn't be happening in 2022. ""We should help each other.

There are no foreign forces encircling the city. What Muscovites are experiencing now is nothing compared to the horrors in Ukraine. At first glance life here even looks normal. As usual, Moscow's Garden Ring is packed with traffic. Crowds are streaming from the metro station opposite me. In reality, though, little here could be described as normal. Normality ended on 24 February when Vladimir Putin ordered his troops into Ukraine for his ""Special Military Operation"". I have experienced Communist Russia. I have lived through post-Soviet Russia. Now the world's largest country has metamorphosed again. Let me take you on a tour of ""Special Military Operation Russia"". I get in the car to drive to the supermarket. By force of habit, I switch on the radio. It's tuned to 91.2 FM - once the home of Radio Echo of Moscow. Echo was my favourite Russian radio station - a reliable source of news and information. But in recent weeks all independent Russian news outlets have either been blocked or shut down. Broadcasting now on 91.2 FM is state-run Radio Sputnik, which backs the Russian offensive in Ukraine. Driving along the Garden Ring, I pass a theatre which has erected on its façade a giant Latin letter Z - the symbol of Russia's military operation. There's another Z outside the headquarters of Russian Railways. I overtake a lorry that has a Z sticker on the side. In recent weeks Zs have been graffitied on the front doors of Kremlin critics. At the shopping mall, business is far from booming. Many of the shops - international brands - have shut down. Since Russian forces attacked Ukraine, hundreds of foreign companies have suspended operations in Russia. In the supermarket, the shelves are full. Last month's sugar shortage in Russia - the result of panic buying - appears to have been resolved. But the range of products seems smaller than before. And over the last two months prices have shot up. Outside the shopping centre, I get chatting to Nadezhda, a doctor. ""Prices are so high, it's impossible to survive now on my salary,"" Nadezhda tells me. ""But the hardest thing of all is living in a society that doesn't want to know the truth about events in Ukraine. People are too busy worrying about their mortgage payments, paying off their debts. They're not interested in what's going on around them. But I think that what's happening in Ukraine is terrible. I'm ashamed to be Russian."" I drive to the Moscow engineering institute where, 30 years ago, I used to teach English. Back in the early 1990s, after the fall of communism, my students here were full of hope that Russia and the West would forge a lasting friendship and partnership; that the future would be peaceful and prosperous. That didn't work out. ""We'll overcome all our difficulties. After sunset always comes the dawn,"" says Denis, a student, outside the institute. ""But I support our troops. They are our soldiers. I am obliged to support my country come what may."" My final destination is the giant war museum that celebrates the Soviet Union's victory over Nazi Germany in World War Two - a glorious victory, achieved at enormous human cost. More than 27 million Soviet citizens were killed in what is known here as the Great Patriotic War. What I find disturbing is how the ""Special Military Operation"" has found a place in this museum, how it's being honoured here. On the museum's website, the spelling of the word ""museum"" has been altered to feature the letter Z. In the museum shop you can buy Z mugs and badges declaring ""Putin is My PreZident"". And the museum is currently hosting an exhibition about Nazis in Ukraine. That helps to cement the Kremlin's bogus claim that the Russian army is liberating Ukraine from Nazism. This is ""Special Military Operation Russia"" - a parallel universe, Orwellian, where invasion is liberation, where aggression is self-defence and where critics are traitors. It feels like the Russia I have known for the last 30 years has gone. "

Jon Wills, 42, decided to skate the distance from Kyiv to the Polish border after feeling ""so frustrated and angry"" he could not do more to help people fleeing the war. He will skateboard up and down the Bristol to Bath cycle path 28 times, hoping to raise £5,000 for Unicef. Mr Wills said he was unable to prepare much, adding: ""It's going to break me"". Starting on Sunday 24 April, the father-of-two predicts he will be skating for between six and 10 hours per day. Mr Wills, who works as a window cleaner, and is from Lacock in Wiltshire, had a ""huge injury"" about a month ago, splitting his elbow open to the bone and bruising his ribs. Illness in his family has also prevented him from training as much as he had planned. ""I'm going to be winging this pretty much. I'm pretty nervous about it,"" he added. When the war began in Ukraine Mr Wills started to become ""frustrated"" while listening to the news at work. ""I just had a random idea that we had all these people fleeing to the Polish border so why not do 372 miles, which replicates the distance from the Polish border to Ukraine's capital Kyiv, on a skateboard?"" While he is an experienced skateboarder, he said he was not used to the long distances and stamina needed to complete an average of 62 miles (100km) per day. ""Skateboarding for me is more about short bursts at the skate park,"" he added. A few friends and colleagues will join him on bicycles and skateboards for short parts of the challenge. ""So that will be nice to give me some motivation and the push that I need to get me through each day. ""It would be amazing to see people cheering me but in my head I didn't see it as a big event, it was just going to be this guy with a stupid idea to skate up and down a track to raise some funds,"" added Mr Wills. His Skate for Ukraine challenge has already raised almost £1,000 on Go Fund Me. Mr Wills hopes to complete it by Friday 29 April so he has ""a couple of days to have a couple of beers"" over the weekend. ""I'm going to have wobbly legs I think by the time I go back to work,"" he added. Follow BBC West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. Send your story ideas to: bristol@bbc.co.uk "
565,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-61178199,2022-04-22T01:29:42,Mariupol: Driving into the 'apocalypse' to save mum and dad," As Russian forces encircled Mariupol, a Ukrainian woman undertook an extraordinary journey into the besieged city to rescue her parents. She is among a small number of people who have braved the risk of attack or abduction to drive in through front lines and a blockade. She has told the BBC of the ""apocalypse"" she witnessed there. Within days of Russia's invasion, Anastasia Pavlova understood what the war was going to mean for Ukraine. The 23-year-old escaped the bombardment of Kharkiv, a city where shelling of residential areas was ""indiscriminate"" - in the words of the local mayor - from the start. Anastasia and her fiance Abakelia went south, to the city of Dnipro. She felt safer here in the tower block apartment of Abakelia's family. But she agonised over the fate of her own parents, who lived on the outskirts of Mariupol. Her mother, Oksana, had faith. She found peace in prayer, and tended the roses in their small brick-built bungalow in the Cheryomushki neighbourhood, an industrial suburb. For the 54-year-old religious studies teacher, the city is the country's most special. ""It has a big name, Mariupol, named after the Virgin Mary,"" she explains. But her prayers were being drowned out as Russian troops advanced. ""Day after day, shells of various calibres were flying over the roof of our small house,"" says Oksana. ""On the fourth day of war I started to think: 'I am not going to get through this.'"" Mariupol quickly descended into what one aid agency described as ""hell"", as Moscow's forces besieged the city. Amid the fighting, civilians had to scavenge for food and water - running water and electricity were cut off and communications collapsed. Many thousands were killed. Military checkpoints controlled movement in and out. Soviet-era Grad missiles - rockets launched from the back of military trucks in what is sometimes described as a ""hailstorm"" - hit the district where Oksana and her husband Dmitry have their home. ""I couldn't catch my breath,"" she recalls, describing the devastation in Biblical terms. It was a tempest, she says. Oksana managed to speak to her daughter in one scratchy phone call. She warned Anastasia: ""Do not come."" But in late March, five weeks into the war, Anastasia decided to try to drive to Mariupol - a journey fraught with danger and exceptionally rare to attempt other than by official humanitarian groups. She hired a driver and van from aid volunteers who were also trying to help evacuate people from the city. They left from Zaporizhzhia, north-west of Mariupol, and the last relatively safe city before the front line. ""No-one wanted to be the lead vehicle,"" explains Anastasia. ""They thought that should someone want to fire at the column, they are going to shoot at the lead vehicle first. My driver was very brave. He said: 'We are going to be the lead vehicle.' I held onto my seat and thought: 'Okay, that's it, I've made my mind up, come what may.'"" A photo was taken of them just before they set off. ""I am smiling here,"" she says. ""But I am frightened. I am as frightened as it's possible to be."" Anastasia felt increasingly anxious as they drove over 260km (160 miles) from Ukrainian-controlled territory, across front lines, navigating the first Russian checkpoint. She felt surprise at first, finding this manned by ""skinny boys who were embarrassed to ask to open the car"". As they moved further into Russian-occupied territory ""more military"" guards appeared, with DPR stripes on their uniforms from the Russian-backed self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic. ""At one of the checkpoints, while checking the documents, the military aimed the barrel of a machine gun at our heads,"" Anastasia says. They demanded to know why they were travelling in. She explained she was going to help her parents and bring medicine to her father. She couldn't shake off the fear. ""It feels like they are about to take your vehicle away or to shoot you, rape you. You constantly expect this to happen. It's scary. You realise that none of your rights are observed here,"" she says. Meanwhile Oksana and her husband Dmitry were sleeping on the floor under blankets and pillows to survive in Mariupol. The house was shaking under shelling and blast waves. Her neighbour chopped wood to cook on a stove outdoors. ""Even in the shelling we realised that this connection between humans,"" says Oksana. ""This help was like the saying they have in war - salvation is found in mercy, in mutual help. Somebody has a decent stove, we had some buckwheat. Others have some water left. We visited an elderly man in the neighbourhood. We were comforting each other, and that made me feel not so scared."" Anastasia didn't know if she would find her parents alive. They travelled for nine hours, arriving in a devastated city. She speaks of appalling journeys along mined roads, passing shallow graves through streets strewn with rubbish, which had been picked up by the wind. They entered Mariupol shortly before curfew. Anastasia says it felt ""like the end of the world"". ""Around you are burning cars, tanks, holes in houses, black buildings with collapsed roofs. Crowds of very dirty people with empty eyes follow [our vehicles] along the mined road. Everything was taken away from them, relatives died. ""Initially, you are looking at the graves, and you are frightened and confused. But once you see about 10 of those, 20, you are just passing by. Maybe it's just me, but somehow it feels like you quickly become accustomed to these atrocities."" They tried to get through the downtown area in the centre of the city but the fighting was intense. At a checkpoint there, Anastasia says they were dangerously close to shelling. Troops told them they had two minutes to move or they would fire on them. Instead, they decided to circle around part of the city further west. A night-time, curfew was approaching and they made their way to the western suburb of Volodarske, where they had heard a school was repurposed as a refugee camp. ""This was probably the second scariest experience,"" says Anastasia. ""It was a pain to witness - as painful as those blackened buildings in Mariupol - the people in this refugee camp."" She said the civilians inside were due to be taken by Moscow's forces the Rostov region in Russia and to Donetsk in eastern Ukraine. This process is referred to by Ukraine as ""filtration"" and condemned by the West as deportation. Moscow describes it as a humanitarian corridor to evacuate civilians. ""There are people who have lost everything. They know that no-one will come after them. The camp is their only chance to survive,"" Anastasia says. ""What I saw inside made me very sick. On the floor and in the corridors, in the classrooms and the gym, people lie almost on top of each other. Everything is mixed - grandparents, women, children. It's hard to breathe there, and people had not had access to running water for a month,"" she says. ""Terrible stories can be heard in the queue [for food]. One grandmother said she spent 10 days in the basement without food. She drank only one raw egg each day. After [hearing] these words, I began to cry,"" she says. Anastasia says she witnessed an ""apocalypse"" that night in Mariupol. ""I felt like everything collapsed inside of me. It seemed as if everything we believed in, everything good, my perception of people, the idea that we are living in civilised society... all of this [had been] wrong. [It was as if] I had been wrong all my life, that people are in fact barbaric and human life is not worth anything. And I dwelled on this that whole night and morning."" Anastasia reached her parents on the second day. ""I could not rejoice, but I could not cry either,"" she says. She told her parents: ""We will cry on Ukrainian territory."" Her mother Oksana calls Anastasia ""a hero"". Residents on the street were stunned that she had made it to Mariupol, and Anastasia says no-one knew what to take with them. She told her mother to fetch her favourite clothes. They managed to evacuate several of their neighbours. ""On the bus we took out eight people."" But Anastasia still thinks of those who can't get out. ""They have to try to stay alive, even if Mariupol is occupied. They are under fire every day. Many do not want to leave, they don't want to leave their homes, or the grave of a husband or wife."" Now her parents are in a safer city to the west of Ukraine, while Anastasia remains in Dnipro with her fiancé Abakelia. She carries guilt over the rescue, she says, because she got her parents to safety while others remain. ""Every day I keep finding out that some of my classmates, some of my relatives, either get killed there or get injured,"" says Anastasia. Her mother Oksana reflects on Mariupol's nightmare. ""Every crime comes with a punishment,"" she says. ""The chalice of anger fills up… and there is God's rage."" But she remains hopeful because, she says, salvation came from her daughter. ""She's a role model to many people,"" says Oksana. ""How to believe in the chance of being rescued - that to stay brave, you need to believe."" "

Speaking from the Azovstal plant - the last part of Mariupol not under Russian control - Svyatoslav Palamar from the controversial Azov regiment said defenders had repelled waves of Russian attacks. ""I always say that as long as we are here, Mariupol remains under control of Ukraine,"" he said. Earlier President Vladimir Putin called off a planned Russian assault on the steelworks - a maze of tunnels and workshops - and ordered his troops to seal it off instead. ""Block off this industrial area so that a fly cannot pass through,"" he said. Much of Mariupol has been destroyed in weeks of heavy Russian bombardment and intense street fighting. Taking the Sea of Azov port is a key Russian war aim and would release more troops to join a Russian offensive in the eastern Donbas region. Capt Palamar said the Russians had fired on the steel plant from warships and dropped ""bunker-busting"" bombs on it. The BBC has not been able to verify any of his account. But it tallies with testimony earlier this week from a Ukrainian marine commander also in the steelworks, who said fighters were outnumbered and running out of supplies. ""All the buildings in the territory of Azovstal are practically destroyed. They drop heavy bombs, bunker-busting bombs which cause huge destruction. We have wounded and dead inside the bunkers. Some civilians remain trapped under the collapsed buildings,"" Capt Palamar said. The Azov regiment was originally a far-right group that was later incorporated into Ukraine's National Guard. Its fighters along with a Marine brigade, border guards and police officers are the last Ukrainian defenders left in the city. When asked how many Ukrainian defenders remained in Mariupol, Capt Palamar answered simply ""enough to repel attacks"". He said that civilians were in separate locations away from fighters. They were in basements containing 80-100 people each but it was unclear how many civilians there were in total as some buildings had been destroyed and fighters could not reach them because of shelling. Entrances to some of the bunkers were blocked by heavy concrete slabs that only heavy machinery could move, he said. ""We keep in touch with those civilians who stay in places that we can get to. We know that there are small children there as young as three months old,"" he said. The fighter appealed for civilians to be given safe passage out of the steelworks and called for a third country or an international body to act as a guarantor for their safety. ""These people have got through a lot already, through war crimes. They don't trust Russians, and they are scared,"" he said, adding that they feared torture and murder at the hands of Russian troops or deportation to Russia through so-called filtration camps. Elderly civilians in the steelworks were in need of medicine while there were also about 500 seriously wounded fighters who were not getting the care they needed - including major surgery such as amputations. ""After 52 days of blockade and heavy fighting we are running of medicines. And then we also keep unburied bodies of our fighters whom we need to bury with dignity in Ukraine-controlled territory,"" he said. Capt Palamar said Ukrainian defenders also wanted to secure their own evacuation if possible - but there could be no question of surrender. ""As for surrender in exchange for the safe way out for civilians, I hope we all know whom we are dealing with. We definitely know that all guarantees, all statements of the Russian Federation are worth nothing."" He said many of the defenders left in Azovstal came from Crimea, annexed by Russia in 2014, as well as the eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions. He himself had been married there and his child had been born there. ""I witnessed how this city was developing. How this city became the pearl of Azov and it's a hometown for me as well,"" he said. ""Russia is not renewing or rebuilding anything. It aims to destroy and terrorise... If we fall this horde will go further and the whole civilised world will be in danger."" Ukraine has accused Russian forces of bombing civilian shelters and of using weapons banned or restricted by international law - including phosphorus bombs and cluster munitions - in attacks on Azovstal. Ukraine as well as the US and UK have announced investigations into the possible use of chemical weapons in Mariupol, something Russia has denied. The BBC cannot independently confirm the allegations. "

Svyatoslav Palamar, from the controversial Azov regiment, said the plant was largely destroyed above ground and civilians were trapped under collapsed buildings. The Azov regiment was originally a far-right neo-Nazi group that was later incorporated into Ukraine's National Guard. Its fighters - along with a Marine brigade, border guards and police officers - are the last Ukrainian defenders left in the city. © 2022 BBC.

Mr Putin told forces to abandon plans to storm the sprawling Azovstal steel works there, where Ukraine is still resisting the invaders. The Azovstal Iron and Steel Works - a massive, four sq-mile (10 sq km) plant in the south-east of the city - has become the last centre of Ukrainian resistance in Mariupol. Civilians as well as fighters are inside the plant. Russian forces have been trying for weeks to dislodge them. The BBC's Toby Luckhurst in Lviv, western Ukraine, has been reporting on Mr Putin's apparent change of mind, and Ukrainian defiance. While Russia talks of isolating the Ukrainian defenders in Azovstal, they remain in contact with the outside world, describing conditions inside the huge steelworks. Captain Svyatoslav Palamar, deputy commander of the Azov Battalion in the complex, told the BBC military and civilians were hiding in several basements in the complex, some of which he and his comrades were unable to reach. ""We know that there are small children there as young as three-months old,"" he said. In recent days, Russian forces had used artillery and heavy bunker-busting bombs to try to destroy them, but all the attacks had failed, Capt Palamar said. He added that more than 500 heavily wounded fighters needed medical help, and bodies of the dead remained unburied. Read more from Capt Palamar's interview here. The situation on the ground in Mariupol remains extremely difficult, with no further evacuations of civilians on Thursday. Meanwhile a grim discovery has been made in a village some 20km (12 miles) outside the city. US satellite firm Maxar says it has identified a mass burial site containing about 200 graves in Manhush. Local Ukrainian officials accuse the Russians of burying Mariupol civilians killed by Russian troops there, but Moscow has not yet responded to the allegations. The city's mayor Vadym Boichenko says tens of thousands of civilians may have been killed in Mariupol. Read more here. Days ago we reported that two British men had been captured by Russian forces in Mariupol. Both Aiden Aslin, 28, and Shaun Pinner, 48, have lived in Ukraine since 2018, and they had both been serving as marines in Ukraine's military since before Russia launched its invasion. On Thursday Russia's foreign ministry said they were being taken care of. ""They are fed, watered, and given the necessary assistance. Just like other foreigners who have surrendered or been detained,"" said spokeswoman Maria Zakharova. Both have been shown on Russian TV, apparently with facial bruising, calling for a prisoner exchange. Their families have called for the Geneva Convention to be respected. Images have been proliferating on social media of wreckage of Russian armour, apparently destroyed by Ukrainian forces. One such image comes with a triumphant caption, saying a tank was destroyed by a Javelin missile. The Javelin, a shoulder-held anti-tank weapon that shoots heat-seeking rockets hurtling towards targets up to 4km (2.5 miles) away, is among items sent to Ukraine through a series of military assistance packages from the US. The latest $800m (£612.5m) package, announced by President Joe Biden on Thursday, also includes heavy artillery, howitzers and tactical drones to be used on the flat plains in eastern Ukraine. What else has the US sent? - the BBC's Bernd Debusmann Jr reports. "
570,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-61145598,2022-04-21T21:27:58,Katty Kay: Why inflation in US is bad for Ukraine," Boy, did I need to get out of the bubble. I've been in Washington DC since the invasion of Ukraine and it's distorted my perspective on America. A few days in Florida have been a healthy wake-up call. Washington is a city that's heavy on foreign policy experts. Between the US state department, the foreign embassies, the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the dozens of think tanks that specialise in national security, it's a town that lives and breathes global affairs. It is easily the most international city I've ever lived in, and I've clocked up a few around the world. My friends here include Venezuelans, Senegalese, Argentinians, French, Italian, Indians, Canadians, Trinidadians. Most of them are engaged in public policy in some way. So, living in Washington, it's easy to forget that the rest of this huge country isn't consumed with world events. And for the past few months the capital of the world's superpower has been obsessed with one issue, and one issue only, Ukraine. In a way that I have never seen here. My neighbour, a former Pentagon official, is flying a very large Ukrainian flag from his second floor window. It flutters down half the front of his tall house. A couple of blocks away some concerned Washingtonians have repainted their huge garage door bright yellow and blue. Colourful, if not subtle. The Ukrainian embassy is a five-minute walk from my front door. Its front steps are littered with bouquets of flowers, supportive messages, and, rather incongruously, the odd teddy bear. These kinds of gestures won't make any difference to Ukrainians themselves of course, but they are a useful way to gauge local sentiment. As is what the US press chooses to cover. I'm fortunate to appear on the US TV network MSNBC as a commentator on current events. It's a role I've had for 15 years, since the war in Iraq. In all that time, all through Iraq and Afghanistan, I've never known US cable channels devote so much time, for so many weeks in a row, to a foreign story which American soldiers aren't even serving in. MSNBC, CNN, Fox News all have correspondents in Ukraine, reporting live all day and all night ever since the invasion. They haven't missed a day. US networks have spent a fortune covering this story, and they, like other global news organisations, including the BBC, have done it really well. Even now, Ukraine still regularly leads TV news bulletins here. This may seem an odd observation to people who don't live in the US. Why wouldn't American television spend the bulk of its coverage on Ukraine? It's a war. It's a huge, important story. Perhaps the defining story of our time. Trust me, it's very unusual. Especially since it's not clear how much American audiences beyond the rarefied world of Washington are really interested. A poll by the University of Maryland suggests Americans are following events closely, support Ukraine over Russia and approve of sending military help to Kyiv. Last weekend churches in small towns across the US sent Easter prayers to Ukrainians. But how much are Americans prepared to sacrifice? That same polls suggests a healthy majority do not support sending US troops, and a third don't think inflation is a price worth paying to help Ukraine. The poll was conducted from mid to late March and the price of energy has only risen since then. Another poll by Quinnipiac University, released on 31 March, shows inflation outstripping the war as Americans' top concern - by a long way. Thirty per cent of adults surveyed in the poll said high prices are their top priority, only 14% said the invasion of Ukraine. This may explain why in Florida the only stripe of blue and yellow I saw was the sunny meeting of sky and sand. I didn't see any ""We stand with Ukraine"" signs or Ukrainian flags taped to apartment windows. I imagine there are a few somewhere, but we drove through several neighbourhoods and didn't spot any. What concerned Floridians I spoke to was the high price of petrol and food, and the lack of rain. Two friends told me rather ruefully that they hadn't really focused on the war and felt disconnected from it. That's not a good sign for either the White House or Ukraine. Chris Jackson, a senior vice-president at Ipsos, which has produced another poll (this is the country of opinion surveys) summed it up: ""The American people are supportive of Ukraine, up to a point."" Where that limit of support lies may well depend on the high price of petrol. So far polls suggest Mr Biden gets more of the blame for that than Mr Putin. The longer the war drags on, the higher food and energy prices will rise in the US. Early in the war Mr Biden told the American people that they would indeed feel the cost of this war - he said he was not going to ""pretend this will be painless"". But he framed it as an existential choice: ""If we do not stand for freedom where it is at risk today, we'll surely pay a steeper price tomorrow."" That was back on 15 February, when most people assumed this would be over quickly. Two long, brutal months later, can the president sustain the nation's will to sacrifice, and for how long? We've seen in the ongoing French election that politicians who ignore local issues to focus on the Ukraine conflict do so at their peril. Marine Le Pen surged in the last two weeks of campaigning before the first round of voting in France in large part because she talked a lot about, you got it, the high price of petrol and food. President Macron had spent most of the campaign telling voters how busy he was managing France's response to the war. US mid-term elections - where control of Congress will be decided - are now six months away, but US officials warn the war in Ukraine will drag on longer than that. Soon those timetables will collide. So while the Biden administration is sending more weapons to Ukraine, the administration is also making a concerted effort to talk publicly about domestic issues. Last week the White House dispatched a senior domestic policy adviser, Susan Rice, to appear on TV shows to announce a new gun control initiative. At the end of an interview, I asked her about the war. Rice used to be the US Ambassador to the United Nations so it seemed a fair question since President Zelensky had been scathing about the global body. But, tempted though she said she was, Rice wouldn't answer the question. Her brief was to talk solely about US domestic policy, not Ukraine. It was a bit awkward, and quite telling. The family and I are back in Washington now, nursing a nagging feeling that none of this bodes well for Ukrainians. Ukraine needs American politicians to continue to feel it is worth spending billions of dollars on weapons for a fight that is 5,000 miles away. For that to happen, it needs those TV editors to continue running news reports about the war. If the audience loses interest, if ratings fall, then the story will start to slip. The Ukrainian refugees who have come here have been welcomed but there just aren't very many of them. It's not like Poland, or other European countries, where millions of refugees are bringing personal tales of suffering that make the war seem closer. Nor does the existential conflict between democracy and autocracy resonate so much outside the policy hothouse of Washington. I have found that Americans are, by nature, extremely generous people. They certainly don't want Ukrainians to suffer. But this is a big country, with big problems of its own, not least the fact that right now it is costing people twice as much as they usually budget just to drive to work. Note to self: get out of town more often. "
571,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-61179663,2022-04-21T20:43:00,War in Ukraine: Orphans settle in Scotland but dream of home," A group of Ukrainian orphans - extracted from a war zone by a Scottish charity started by football fans - have finally settled into their new home. The group of 52 children and their guardians made headlines when the Dnipro Kids charity fought red tape to bring them to safety in Scotland. After a month of rest and recovery in Callander near Stirling, they are now living in Edinburgh. Some of the older children have been speaking about their new lives. Rita, 17, thinks Scotland is ""beautiful"". She said: ""It's very pretty. I like it very much and the place we stay in is very different from what we have in Ukraine. So far we like everything. I like it here."" But there is still a lingering sadness for what has been left behind. ""On one side I am so very sad for so many friends I left in Ukraine, but I have met some good friends here in Scotland already. It's cool."" Sasha, 16, explained that the journey from Dnipro to Poland and then on to Scotland was ""difficult, long and uncomfortable"". He said the situation has been hard for all of them but that they have been supporting each other. As one of the older children, he helps his house mother. He said: ""It's lots of responsibility. I have to help my mother - she needs my help and I help her to stay more relaxed. ""It is difficult for the children to be in another country and they are doing their best, trying not to make mistakes that will cause any trouble. Mum always protects them asking them to be careful."" Sasha likes Edinburgh and says Scottish people have been kind to them, but thoughts of home are never far away. ""It is a beautiful city and very nice people,"" he said. ""But I miss my home very much. I worry a lot because war takes a lot of innocent lives and I hope that all the people I love and care about will be safe. ""I miss Dnipro and I hope to go back soon."" Stevie Carr has worked with Dnipro Kids for many years and finds it hard to take in what the tiny charity has achieved in getting the Ukrainian children out of the war-ravaged country . He told BBC Scotland: ""It's absolutely unbelievable that on the back of a just a football match 17 years ago, that this charity has managed to achieve something that was probably impossible to imagine at the start of March. ""The fact we have done it is phenomenal, with too many people to mention who have helped us along the way."" During a UEFA Cup trip to the Ukrainian city of Dnipropetrovsk, in September 2005, a handful of Hibernian FC supporters organised a collection for some local orphans. The gesture turned into an official charity and the team's supporters adopted the Dnipro Appeal. In its first year, funds bought the children of the orphanage winter coats and boots and then paid for medical equipment and repairs to their building. Over the years the charity helped more children in the city. After the Russian invasion, the plight of the children gained the charity support with both the Scottish and UK governments involved in efforts to evacuate the children to safety. English lessons began for the young people this week and City of Edinburgh Council is working on plans for the group which ranges in ages from one to 19. Andy McWhirter, from social work services, said the council's main role was to restore some sense of normality. ""The important thing is they are guests here and they all want to go home,"" he said. ""We need to find a balance to help them integrate and relate to Scotland but to support their Ukrainian identity and not impose our values and views on their experience."" Their education will be mindful of their connection to Ukraine, using online lessons being provided to displaced children by the Ukrainian authorities. Natalie Radchenko worked for Dnipro Kids in Ukraine and travelled with the group, often acting as their translator. She has seen a change in the children since they settled in Scotland. She said: ""We are all very happy to be somewhere nice and safe. ""Everyone is a bit tired of travelling but I think they are getting better after all the stress and the horrible situation. ""The kids were very quiet in the beginning but now you can see them smiling and happy."" Analysis from Catriona Renton, BBC Scotland Senior News Reporter It has been a long, exhausting and, at times, emotional journey. BBC Scotland first met the children and young people as they crossed the Polish border on their way to their ultimate destination - Edinburgh. In the last week they have been settling into their accommodation here. It is no mean feat for the tiny charity set up by Hibs supporters to get them here. The young people I spoke to were so positive and full of hope. The strong bonds between them are so clear to see with the older teenagers helping take care of the little ones. They are making the best of the most difficult of situations, laughing, smiling and playing with each other. Their house mothers show so much strength - they have left family behind but stoically support and protect their families here. But the biggest hope the young people and mothers have of all is to return to Dnipro and the people they love there. "
572,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-60774098,2022-04-21T19:26:30,What weapons has the US given Ukraine - and how much do they help?," The burnt-up wreckage of a Russian tank lies in the dirt, while in an accompanying photo next to it, a Ukrainian soldier carries the armaments said to have caused the destruction. The images posted to Twitter by the Ukrainian Armed Forces are labelled with a triumphant caption, declaring that this was the result of ""hits from Javelins on [Russian] military equipment"". The Javelin, a shoulder-held anti-tank weapon that shoots heat-seeking rockets hurtling towards targets up to 4km (2.5 miles) away, can be controlled by a portable unit that doesn't look much different from a video game console - but can send a metre-long projectile straight through the side or top of an armoured tank. The very presence of the American-made weapons ""causes panic"" among Russian troops, the Ukrainian military claims - and the US has sent thousands of them. Javelin missiles are among the items that have been sent to Ukraine through a series of military assistance packages. In total, more than $3bn in military aid has been sent to Ukraine since Russia invaded on 24 February. The latest $800m (£612.5m) package, announced by President Joe Biden on Thursday, also includes heavy artillery, howitzers and tactical drones to be used on the flat plains in eastern Ukraine. Mr Biden also banned Russian-flagged ships from entering US ports. Other armaments sent so far include drones that can be turned into flying bombs and anti-aircraft weapons that can shoot helicopters from the sky. But will these shipments help Ukraine overcome Russia's more numerous - and better equipped - invasion force? The most recent US security aid package for Ukraine includes ""dozens"" of howitzers - a type of artillery that fires shells at targets on high trajectories - as well as 144,000 rounds of ammunition and tactical drones. ""We're in a critical window now of time where they're going to set the stage for the next phase of this war,"" Mr Biden said on Wednesday, adding that the weapons are a reflection of ""Ukraine's needs"" as the war shifts towards the largely flat terrain of Ukraine's eastern Donbas region. Previous announcements of weapons for Ukraine have included a wide range of military equipment, ranging from body armour, helmets and rifles to radar systems, armoured vehicles and Soviet-designed helicopters that once belonged to Afghanistan. Besides Javelin missiles, the most powerful weapons include Stinger anti-aircraft systems, once famously used to shoot down Soviet planes in Afghanistan. The US has also shipped hundreds of ""Switchblade"" drones, which are designed to be sent crashing into enemy targets before exploding. While US defence officials have been reluctant to provide Ukraine with weapons that its forces weren't already familiar with, this week Pentagon spokesman John Kirby confirmed that a ""small number"" of Ukrainian troops will be trained on how to use the Switchblades, as well as US-supplied artillery systems. ""We're doing the best we can to focus on the kinds of capabilities we know they need and that they want and are using, and...secondary to that, to try to get them systems that they don't need a lot of start-up time for, that they can put in the field almost immediately,"" Mr Kirby said. Additionally, the Pentagon said on Thursday that it is giving Ukraine ""ghost drones"" - similar in capabilities to the Switchblade - that Mr Kirby said were ""rapidly developed by the Air Force in response specifically to Ukrainian requirements"". The range and specific capabilities of the ""ghost drones"", however, are not publicly known. Military experts say that the US-supplied anti-tank weapons have been among the most effective weapons in Ukraine's arsenal since the war began. ""Sometimes we will speak softly and carry a large Javelin, because we're sending a lot of those in as well,"" Mr Biden said this week of US aid to Ukraine. The invading Russian forces ""are primarily mechanised forces"" - meaning armoured convoys - so ""the best thing you can do is take them [the vehicles] out"", said former US Army Colonel Christopher Mayer. Ukraine has received a variety of anti-tank systems from several countries, which helps increase the ""lethality"" of Ukraine's forces against Russian vehicles, Mr Mayer said. ""If you give them a variety of anti-tank systems, it provides them with multiple opportunities to punch through whatever particular defensive armour protection systems that tank has,"" he said. And while their claims can't be independently verified, Ukrainian officials say they are putting the weapons to good use. As of this week, Ukraine claims to have destroyed more than 800 tanks and 2,000 other Russian vehicles. Anti-tank weapons, however, do nothing to help Ukraine combat Russia's air force, which for eight weeks has been striking targets across the country. That requires anti-aircraft weapons, about 25,000 of which had been given to Ukraine by the US and its allies by 7 April. Of these, the most well-known is the man-portable, shoulder-fired Stinger system. The system has been seen in conflicts around the world since 1981. It was most famously used in Afghanistan, where US-supplied Stingers helped bring down hundreds of Russian aircraft and helicopters during the Soviet occupation. It is effective against low-flying helicopters or aircraft at up to about 3,800m (12,400ft), making it relatively useless against higher-flying Russian bombers. Maintaining an ability to strike these aircraft has been a high priority for Ukrainian military planners, particularly since some of its own air defence systems have been destroyed during the war. In mid-April, however, nearby Slovakia sent Ukraine the Soviet-era S-300 anti-aircraft missile, which is designed to strike aircraft at higher altitudes. The shipment was part of a deal with the US, which agreed to deploy US units fielding an American-made anti-aircraft system - Patriot missiles - to Slovakia. The US has so far been reluctant to send Ukraine US-made tanks, arguing that Ukrainian troops aren't familiar with the vehicles. ""The kinds of tanks they know how to use are not the tanks that we have in our armoury,"" Mr Kirby said at the Pentagon on 19 April. ""But other nations have provided some tanks [and] some nations have provided spare parts so that they can get their inoperable tanks operable again."" Similarly, while the US has so far committed to sending Ukraine 16 Mi-17 helicopters, it has not directly sent aircraft to Ukraine and has described a plan to send Soviet-made Mig-29 jets from other countries - such as Poland - to Ukraine as untenable. US allies, however. have provided spare parts that have allowed its air force to continue to fly limited sorties against a numerically-superior Russian air force. On 20 April, a senior US defence official said that Ukraine has 20 more aircraft available to them now than three weeks ago as a result of allied-supplied spare parts. "

Maxar said its images showed an expansion of graves that began at the end of March. Local Ukrainian officials accuse the Russians of burying Mariupol civilians killed by Russian troops there. Moscow has not yet responded. Russian troops control most of Mariupol after weeks of bombardment and fighting, but some Ukrainian forces remain in a sprawling steelworks in the city. President Putin has abandoned plans to storm the Azovstal plant and instead told troops to seal it off. The alleged mass grave is near a village called Manhush about 20km (12 miles) west of Mariupol. Maxar said there were four sections of linear rows about 85m long. The BBC has not independently verified the images. Mariupol city council earlier issued its own statement accusing the Russians of burying civilians at the same location. The council said the Russians were digging trenches and ""using dump lorries to bring the bodies"" and provided its own aerial image of the site, which it said was ""already twice as large as the nearby cemetery"". The city's mayor Vadym Boichenko says tens of thousands of civilians may have been killed in Mariupol Moscow has repeatedly denied accusations by Ukraine and its Western allies that Russian troops and top Kremlin politicians are responsible for mass killings of civilians. Earlier this month, Maxar images of the town of Bucha outside Kyiv appeared to show bodies of civilians lying in the street nearly two weeks before the Russians left the town as part of a withdrawal from northern Ukraine. The image from 19 March, first reported by the New York Times and confirmed by the BBC, contradicted Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov's claim that footage of bodies in Bucha had been ""staged"" after the Russians withdrew. Bucha Mayor Anatoliy Fedoruk has said that least 300 civilians were killed in the town. "

Catherine Hummel is waiting to host two mothers from Odessa, who have three daughters between them, at her family home in Caernarfon, Gwynedd. Their escape route is planned and their tickets booked. The UK government said more than 71,800 visas had been granted and 21,600 Ukrainians had arrived in the UK. After a month's wait, the families still need one more visa before they can leave war-torn Ukraine, Mrs Hummel said. Catherine, who is married to Adam and has two teenage children, Alex and Thea, said the situation was becoming increasingly ""frustrating"" and ""dangerous"". They are among the 10,000 people who have applied for the Homes for Ukraine scheme. Others have complained that the system is too slow and bureaucratic amid an urgent need to get people to safety. Catherine and one of the mothers she will host, Nataliya Isaieva, spoke to BBC Radio Wales Breakfast about their plight. After appearing on the programme, the families were subsequently awarded the visa they were waiting for. ""Every day and night, rockets are fired in our direction and the situation in our region has changed,"" said Nataliya. ""I can't explain the fear we feel when we hear rockets flying over our house. ""At first we're think 'thank God this rocket is not shooting my house,' but then we understand that it's hit another house and killed another child and it's terrible."" She said the offer to live in Wales gave her ""the joy of the opportunity to save my children"". ""The plan is to get from Odessa to Poland by train if it will be possible and then by bus we have booked a ticket from Poland to Kent,"" she said. ""[We] haven't received one visa and we may lose this."" Catherine, who runs a campsite and met both families on Facebook, said: ""It's four weeks today that we applied for the visas, so it's very frustrating, everything is on hold. ""We Zoom at least once a week and it started off fairly upbeat in some peculiar way once we met because we just clicked as two families straight away. ""Every week I would say their mood has changed because they just want to get out to keep their children safe. ""They had two air raid sirens last night, and they usually have more than that so they are having to get up out of bed, go to a safe place so they are having broken sleep every night, so I say they are absolutely exhausted as well."" Every day, Catherine emails the UK government and visa centres, but said she had been ""sent round and round in a loop and nobody seems to help, they just pass you on"". ""I just don't see this missing visa is ever going to materialise,"" she said. ""There's this black hole of missing visas... something's going wrong somewhere."" She said she was increasingly worried for the families' safety: ""The longer they are in Odessa the more dangerous it gets."" The UK government said: ""We are processing thousands of visas a day - this shows the changes we made to streamline the service are working and we'll continue to build on this success so we can speed up the process even further.""

Louise Fellows, who is helping via the Homes for Ukraine scheme, said Vadym and his mother Kateryna have been waiting in Poland since 23 March. ""I'm really embarrassed that it's taking this long,"" said Mrs Fellows, of Warwick. The government said it was processing thousands of visas a day. Vadym has been given a free place at The Croft Preparatory School in Stratford-upon-Avon, which had been hoping to welcome him for the start of the summer term today. Marcus Cook, head of the independent school, said he was sad Vadym missed his first day but added he was delighted the school had been able to offer him a place for the term. Kateryna and Vadym left Mykolaiv in southern Ukraine, to stay in temporary accommodation in Poland. They will live with Mrs Fellows who made contact through Facebook via another woman who is matching Ukrainians with families in Warwickshire. The two mothers shared family stories with each other over a video call. The Homes for Ukraine scheme has been widely criticised because of delays, with Home Secretary Priti Patel earlier this month apologising for the ""frustrating"" lags in the scheme. Mrs Fellows said part of the delay in her case was that documents had to be uploaded twice due them disappearing on the system. A spokesperson for the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities (DLUHC) said that there was ""no evidence of data lost"" and the system works in the interest of security; once the documents are uploaded they are sent straight away to the Home Office. Matt Western, the MP for Warwick and Leamington, spoke in Parliament about Kateryna's situation last month and asked the minister to ""step up"". Eddie Hughes, who is working as Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Rough Sleeping and Housing replied: ""The pace at which we are getting through applications is ramping up; we will very soon be working our way through more than 10,000 a week"". Mrs Fellows said she was told by the Home Office on 11 April the visa applications would be processed within 48 hours. Ten days later and the families say they have not heard anything since.

576,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-61179640,2022-04-21T16:41:37,"Work from home to beat Putin, says EU"," The EU is asking its citizens to drive less, turn down air conditioning and work from home three days a week, to reduce reliance on Russian energy. The measures, drawn up with the International Energy Agency, would save a typical household €450 (£375) a year. Buying energy from Russia helps to support its economy and finance the war in Ukraine. But Europe has said it cannot find alternative supplies, so it is asking citizens to adjust their lifestyles. The nine-point plan, entitled “Playing My Part”, urges citizens to drive less, by using public transport, or working from home three days a week. It also calls on citizens to: It also calls on cities to promote car-free Sundays, as some already do. “Faced with the horrendous scenes of human suffering that we’ve seen following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, people in Europe want to take action,” said Fatih Birol, executive director of the IEA. “This guide has easy-to-follow steps that with little or no discomfort on our part can reduce the flow of money to Russia’s military and help put us on a path to a cleaner and more sustainable planet.” The IEA calculates that if every citizen followed its recommendations, it could save 220 million barrels of oil every year, enough to fill 120 supertankers. It would also save 17bn cubic metres of gas, enough to heat nearly 20 million homes. In March, the EU announced a plan to make the bloc independent of Russian energy imports by 2030. But the German energy minister Christian Lindner told the BBC on Wednesday it would be impossible to stop oil imports immediately. The report also recommends that citizens consider investing in home insulation, smart digital thermostats, and digital cars, which can all help to reduce fossil fuel use. ""All these measures, they can be voluntary contributions,"" said Leonore Gewessler, Austria's environment minister. ""But they need political action to underpin them."" Austria has cut all fares on public transport to three euros per day, she said, and is introducing a programme to help low-income households replace old, inefficient appliances. Eamon Ryan, Ireland's environment minister said by acting at a European level, it was easier to get the political messaging right. ""It is very difficult not to come across as someone who is telling the citizen what to do, or is being seen as a mean, Scrooge-like character,"" he said. Separately, the UK announced it was tightening sanctions on non-energy goods exported from Russia, including a ban on caviar, silver and wood products. The Department for International Trade said it was also ramping up taxes on some other exports from Russia and Belarus, covering goods worth a total of £130m. The products facing higher import duties include diamonds, rubber, pharmaceuticals, meat, coffee, tobacco and other products. International Trade Secretary, Anne-Marie Trevelyan, said the UK was taking every opportunity to ""ratchet the pressure to isolate the Russian economy"". ""These further measures will tighten the screws, shutting down lucrative avenues of funding for Putin's war machine,"" she said. "

Aiden Aslin, 28, and Shaun Pinner, 48, were captured last week while defending the south-eastern city of Mariupol. In footage shown on Russian state TV, both appeared to have facial bruising, prompting their families to call for the Geneva Convention to be respected. Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said: ""Don't worry, the Russian side is taking care of them."" She added: ""They are fed, watered, and given the necessary assistance. Just like other foreigners who have surrendered or been detained."" Ms Zakharova also referenced what she described as a call by Prime Minister Boris Johnson for British detainees to be shown mercy, and said that in turn Britain should ""show mercy"" to the citizens of Ukraine by stopping the supply of weapons to the Ukrainian government. Mr Johnson had urged Russia to treat captured British fighters ""humanely and compassionately"". The Geneva Convention states that prisoners of war must be protected ""against acts of violence or intimidation and against insults and public curiosity"". Both Mr Aslin, originally from Newark in Nottinghamshire, and Mr Pinner, originally from Bedfordshire, have lived in Ukraine since 2018. They had both been serving as marines in Ukraine's military since before Russia launched its invasion. In separate clips broadcast on Monday on the Rossiya 24 TV channel, each was seen calling on Boris Johnson to arrange for them to be freed in exchange for Viktor Medvedchuk, a pro-Kremlin Ukrainian politician currently being held by Ukraine. It is not clear whether the men were speaking under duress. Speaking in the House of Commons on Wednesday, Robert Jenrick, the MP for Mr Aslin's home constituency, described the broadcasts as a ""flagrant breach"" of the Geneva Convention. He later told the BBC that a prisoner exchange was the ""most likely route"" to get Mr Aslin to safety, but added it would be for the Ukrainian government to decide whether a swap could take place. The families of both Mr Aslin and Mr Pinner have released statements saying that the men are long-serving members of the Ukrainian military and not volunteers or mercenaries. Mr Aslin's family said he was a ""much-loved young man with... a loving wife-to-be"" and described the footage of him as ""deeply distressing"". ""Together with the family of Shaun Pinner, we are in contact with the Foreign Office to ensure the Russian authorities meet their obligations to prisoners of war under international law, and ultimately to secure the release of Aiden and Shaun,"" they said. Mr Pinner's family described him as a well-respected soldier and ""funny, much-loved, [and] well-intentioned"". Meanwhile, the UK government announced a new raft of sanctions targeting key figures within Russia's military and others supporting the war effort. The measures included asset freezes and travel bans for the commander of the Russian airborne forces Col Gen Andrey Serdyukov, and Lt Col Azatbek Omurbekov, the commanding officer of the unit accused of committing war crimes in the Ukrainian town of Bucha. Also targeted was Oleg Belozyorov, CEO of Russian Railways, which has helped in the transport of Russian military equipment, and Ilya Kiva, a former member of the Ukrainian parliament expelled last month over his support for the Russian invasion.

Mr Putin told forces to abandon plans to storm the sprawling Azovstal steel works there, where Ukraine is still resisting the invaders. But an official in the controversial Azov battalion said Mr Putin ""has just admitted their possible defeat"". ""They're not able to occupy the Azovstal,"" Maksym Zhorin told the BBC. The Azovstal Iron and Steel Works - a massive, four sq-mile (10 sq km) plant in the south-east of the city - has become the last centre of Ukrainian resistance in Mariupol. Civilians as well as fighters are inside the plant. Taking the port city is a key war aim for President Putin. It would give his forces a land bridge to Ukraine's Crimean peninsula, which Russia occupied in 2014. But despite controlling most of the city, the Russians still have not dislodged the Ukrainian troops inside the Azovstal works. At a televised meeting with Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu on Thursday, Mr Putin officially cancelled plans to assault the works and ordered instead that the area be sealed off. ""Block off this industrial area so that a fly cannot not pass through,"" he said. ""There is no need to climb into these catacombs and crawl underground through these industrial facilities,"" he said, while praising Mr Shoigu for the successful operation to ""liberate Mariupol"" from Ukraine. It comes after weeks of Russian bombardment of the area, and repeated demands for Ukrainian troops within to surrender. It is unclear how easy it would be for Russian forces to wholly seal off the site. It is a maze of tunnels and workshops and provides a natural advantage to defenders. Yan Gagin, an official with the separatist Donetsk People's Republic, told Russian state news network RIA over the weekend that there is ""basically another city"" beneath the plant. The BBC cannot independently confirm how many civilians remain inside the steel works. But Maksym Zhorin, a former commander of the Azov battalion - a controversial national guard unit with links to the far-right, which Russia has vowed to destroy - tells us there are more than 2,000 civilians sheltering there, and ""many more"" elsewhere in the city. Speaking on the phone from Kyiv, Mr Zhorin said the roughly 1,000 Ukrainian defenders left in the works have been fighting in ""360 degrees for more than one month"", repulsing attacks from all angles. Despite what Mr Putin said today, ""the situation hasn't changed"", he said. First of all, let's believe it when we see it. It should become quickly apparent if Russian forces switch from bombarding the Azovstal plant to simply blockading it. But if they do, why the change of plan? Mr Putin is anxious to get on with his offensive in the Donbas. The fight for Mariupol has drained vital resources and pinned down Russian troops who could be used to pursue wider objectives. Separated from the centre of Mariupol by the Kal'mius River, the sprawling steel plant should be relatively easy to isolate, but if Mr Putin wants to be sure that ""not a fly gets through"", he will need to leave significant forces in place. With President Zelensky vowing to call off peace talks if the city's last defenders are killed, it's also possible that Mr Putin wants to keep the diplomatic process - or at least the semblance of a process - alive. There may even be an economic element to this. Azovstal is one of Europe's biggest steel works. Even after weeks of appalling destruction, Moscow may be hoping that there's something of value to salvage. Mr Zhorin accused Russian forces of bombing civilian shelters and of using weapons banned or restricted by international law - including phosphorus bombs and cluster munitions - in attacks on Azovstal. Ukraine as well as the US and UK have announced investigations into the possible use of chemical weapons in Mariupol, something Russia has denied. The BBC cannot independent confirm the allegations. He also said the battle for Mariupol was like ""a test for the world"". ""Whether humanity can react, can unite, in order to save innocent civilians,"" he said. On Wednesday a Ukrainian marine commander told the BBC in a video message that they were caring for 500 injured troops inside the plant. Major Serhiy Volyna said they were desperately low on supplies, and said his message could be ""our last address to the world"". Officials say around 100,000 civilians remain elsewhere in the city. Attempts to bring them out through humanitarian corridors have floundered. Ukraine and Russia accused each other of bad faith in the negotiations. Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk announced on Thursday that just four buses of civilians had managed to leave the city the previous day. The BBC's Samantha Granville is in Zaporizhzhia waiting for them - she says there is optimism they will arrive but the timing is unclear. The authorities have set up a big tent at the evacuation centre with volunteers inside ready to feed and clothe evacuees. Additional reporting by Olga Pona "

The donations, including 21 vehicles, will provide ""vital support"" to Ukrainian firefighters, the National Fire Chiefs Council (NFCC) said. The project, led by UK charity Fire Aid and supported by the Home Office, saw a first convoy leave Ashford on 19 March. More than 60 firefighters volunteered to drive the supplies across Europe. Kent Fire and Rescue Service tweeted a video of the convoy leaving on Thursday. The NFCC said the donated equipment includes fire engines, helmets, thermal imaging cameras, generators and rescue gear which will all be handed over to the Polish State Fire Service before its transfer to Ukraine. Mark Hardingham, NFCC chairman, said: ""We continue to see horrific scenes unfold every day and this equipment will go some way to assist our Ukrainian colleagues as they continue with their biggest challenge to date, while putting their own lives at risk, with limited resources. ""Any help UK fire and rescue services can give, will be given gladly."" Claire Hoyland from Fire Aid said the way UK fire services had mobilised to support Ukraine made her ""so proud"", adding that she spoke with Ukrainian partners and the State Emergency Services almost daily and ""equipment is currently being destroyed, damaged, or lost on a huge scale"". The NFCC said 100 fire stations and 250 fire engines have been destroyed in Ukraine as the war with Russia continues. The movement of donations is supported with funding from the Home Office, Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office, and the FIA Foundation. In a statement, Home Secretary Priti Patel called the project a ""phenomenal collaborative effort"". Ms Patel said: ""Our fire and rescue services are going above and beyond to support the effort in Ukraine and I am proud to once again support a convoy of fire service equipment being sent to those in desperate need.""

Why Gujurat? Because a large number of Gujuratis live in the UK and it's the home state of India's PM Narendra Modi. On the drive from Ahmedabad's airport to the city centre, there were miles of billboards celebrating the visit, and crowds waving Indian and UK flags. This is not the sort of enthusiasm Boris Johnson has enjoyed much recently, as Tory MPs grouch and grumble about the lockdown-breaking party saga that drags on and on. They aren't angry enough to try to depose Mr Johnson (there's also a war in Ukraine and a shortage of obvious replacements champing at the bit), but his troops back home wait for the next update from the Met Police with weary resignation. Out here in the blistering Indian heat, the prime minister is giving every impression of not caring too much about what people back home are saying about partygate. On the plane over he waved away questions about whether he'd resign if the fines piled up. He insisted he would lead his party into the next general election. I've written this on a Chinook helicopter whisking the PM and his team to open a remote JCB factory. Trumpeting business links between the UK and one of the biggest economies in the world is a big theme of the trip. So too is Ukraine and Boris Johnson was clear he would tread gingerly in his talks with Mr Modi in Delhi on Friday. India's long-standing neutrality and abstentions on UN votes condemning Russia's invasion may dismay the British, but they won't say so publicly. Instead, Boris Johnson is hoping to wean India off its reliance on Russian energy and Russian military hardware. The talks in Delhi will certainly cover defence; it's a market into which the UK wants to encroach further. For Mr Johnson, this visit is a chance to look the statesman and enjoy the distraction provided by the dancers and drummers who appear at every turn. What does Narendra Modi make of it all? Is he as confident as his opposite number that a free trade deal could be done by the end of the year? There won't be a joint news conference to find out, because India's PM doesn't do them. Whether Boris Johnson will raise concerns about India's press freedom, communal relations or protections for minorities isn't clear. The UK needs India as an economic and military ally more than ever. "

The BBC has seen a document dated 2006 and signed ""Lubov Golubeva"", the maiden name of Lubov Chernukhin, a Tory donor. Mrs Chernukhin says she ""does not recall consenting in writing"" to being a director of Suleiman Kerimov's firm. Mr Kerimov, now sanctioned, previously denied any connection with Mrs Chernukhin. Papers seen by the BBC appear to show that Mrs Chernukhin, then Lubov Golubeva, was appointed a director of offshore company Radlett Estates Limited, in 2005 - following its acquisition of a substantial property, 1 Radlett Place, in north London. Another firm - Swiru Holding AG - was the sole shareholder of Radlett Estates. The directors of Radlett Estates were Swiss businessman Alexander Studhalter and Suleiman Kerimov's nephew, Nariman Gadzhiev. Mr Studhalter was accused in a French court of being a so-called ""straw man"", or proxy, for Mr Kerimov - involved in hiding the oligarch's wealth. Radlett Estates had planned to demolish the building and construct a new 3,500 sq-ft (325 sq-m) home. According to architects' plans, there was to be a cinema, a health spa and gym, indoor swimming pool, a map room, six bedrooms and a ""6 car motorised garage and large staff quarters"". Mr Kerimov and his wife were not listed as directors of Radlett Estates and their names were not on the planning documents seen by the BBC. But one designer's website identified the clients as ""Mr and Mrs K"". The signature ""Lubov Golubeva"" appears on a Radlett Estates board meeting document from 2006. It records her resignation from the company. In 2007, Ms Golubeva married Vladimir Chernukhin - a multimillionaire businessman who had served under President Putin as a junior minister, but later fled Russia. The same year, she started giving money to the Conservative Party - initially in £5,000 donations under her maiden name. As time went on, the donations - in her married name - became much bigger. She would end up becoming one of the Tory party's most influential donors - having given more than £2.1m. The discovery of the evidence suggesting a business connection between Mrs Chernukhin and Mr Kerimov follows questions in Parliament about her and her links to Russia. This was despite Mrs Chernukhin's condemnation of ""Russian military aggression in Ukraine"" where she called for ""the strongest possible sanctions against Putin's regime and its enablers"". Earlier this month, the BBC - as part of the Pandora Papers Russia project with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) and global partners - revealed how Suleiman Kerimov has been hiding his wealth. Lubov Chernukhin's husband Vladimir was in the Russian government between 2000 and 2002. He was then appointed chairman of a state bank by Mr Putin, but left Russia after being dismissed by the president in 2004. But in a 2018 court case, his wife confirmed that Mr Chernukhin had maintained ""excellent"" relationships with ""prominent members of the Russian establishment"". Mr Chernukhin said he arrived in the UK with a fortune of $300m (£230m) and started building a ""real estate empire"". Both he and his wife are now UK citizens - which means she is entitled to donate to a political party. In February, she was reported to be a member of a small ""advisory board"" of major donors with access to senior party members, including the prime minister. In 2019, she paid £135,000 to attend a ladies' night dinner attended by then-Prime Minister Theresa May, and then-Chief Secretary to the Treasury Liz Truss, who is now foreign secretary with responsibility for sanctions against Russia. In 2020, the BBC revealed how Mr Chernukhin had been secretly funded with $8m by a company linked to Mr Kerimov four years previously - before Mr Kerimov was first sanctioned by the US. At that time, her lawyers said ""Mrs Chernukhin has never received money deriving from Mr Kerimov or any company related to him"" and her ""donations to the Conservative Party have never been tainted by Kremlin or any other influence"". Lawyers for Mr Kerimov said he had had ""no dealings whatsoever"" with Mrs Chernukhin. Suleiman Kerimov was among a dozen billionaires called to stand alongside President Putin as Russia's tanks rolled into Ukraine in February. The businessman has been estimated to be worth more than $14bn. Mr Kerimov has been subject to US sanctions since 2018 - and since March by the EU and UK. The EU described him as ""a member of the inner circle of oligarchs"" close to Mr Putin. In 2017, Mr Kerimov was arrested in France over his alleged role in laundering the proceeds of tax evasion. The case related to French properties which investigators believed were owned by Mr Kerimov - his ownership hidden by Alexander Studhalter acting as a proxy for the oligarch. Mr Studhalter denies being the ""straw man"" for Mr Kerimov and says he was the real owner of the properties through a Swiss company called Swiru Holding AG. But - according to secret French Court of Appeal records seen by the BBC - bank documents showed Mr Studhalter was holding shares in Swiru Holding on behalf of Mr Kerimov and his nephew, Nariman Gadzhiev. Mr Kerimov's French lawyers said: ""After several years of investigation, no charges were brought against our client."" Mr Kerimov and Mr Studhalter did not respond to our questions about the ownership of 1 Radlett Place, which was sold to another offshore company in 2012 for £36.5m. Mr and Mrs Chernukhin's lawyers said ""Mrs Chernukhin has never been a director of Radlett"". She had, they said, been approached in relation to the ""Radlett Project"" in her capacity as a director of another business called Capital Construction Development Limited - a company then owned by her husband - and ""asked to submit a pitch"". The project did not proceed, they said. The BBC has seen conflicting evidence of Mrs Chernukhin's relationship with Radlett Estates Limited. An email in December 2009 quoted a representative of Swiru Holding - the sole shareholder of Radlett Estates - as saying they could not find ""any evidence"" in their files that ""Mr or Ms Golubov [sic] have been appointedd [sic], nor any Resolutions or Resignation/Acceptance letters."" And documents show representatives of Swiru repeatedly submitted corporate documents to Radlett's registered agent - its administrator in the British Virgin Islands (BVI) - which contained no mention of Lubov Golubeva. But a number of leaked registers of directors - including from three of the agent's offices in Switzerland, the BVI and Cyprus - show Mrs Chernukhin, then Lubov Golubeva, listed as a director. Asked about those documents, and the one showing Lubov Golubeva's resignation in 2006, lawyers for the Chernukhins said ""Mrs Chernukhin does not recall consenting in writing to being a director of Radlett Estates Limited"" and questioned whether the documents were ""forgeries and/or may have been manipulated"". Anti-money laundering expert Tom Keatinge at the think tank Rusi, told us it was possible the signature was a forgery - but unlikely. ""Documents show she was present at a meeting where her continued directorship was being discussed. And indeed at that meeting she resigned as a director so I think it stretches the imagination to suggest her identity was stolen."" Rachel Davies of Transparency International says the BBCs investigation underlines why the system of political donations has to be more transparent. ""Any politician or political party ought to have a clear understanding of the nature of their benefactor. That means conducting due diligence over those who sponsor their activities, not just looking at whether the funds they receive are lawful but ensuring they're exercising good judgement in receiving them in the first place."" A Conservative Party spokesperson said, ""if a British citizen is able to vote in an election for a political party, they also have the democratic right to donate to a political party. All donations are properly and transparently declared to the Electoral Commission, published by them, and comply fully with the law."" Additional reporting by Will Dahlgreen "

On the 56th day of the Russian invasion, it was hoped that 6,000 people would be able to flee the besieged city on a convoy of buses. But just a few thousand were able to get out in the end, Mariupol officials say. As the mass evacuation plans stalled, Ukrainian forces holding out in a steelworks in the city ignored the latest Russian ultimatum for them to surrender. Mariupol's defenders are holed up in a network of bunkers and tunnels underneath the city's massive Azovstal steel plant, reportedly with 1,000 civilians alongside them. But the fighters say they are running out of supplies and won't be able to hold out for much longer. One Ukrainian commander even delivered what he said would likely be his ""last address to the world"" For weeks Russian troops have been trying to take full control of the city, which would free up their military resources. It would also complete a land bridge enabling Russian forces on the annexed Crimean peninsula to link up with separatist forces in the east. For the relatives of Mariupol's remaining defenders, this is a bitter moment of fear mixed with pride. Olena Nikulina's 26-year-old cousin is one of the Ukrainian fighters holding out. ""I would have never imagined my cousin to become a true hero of Ukraine and of Mariupol. I dream of the day he will return,"" she told Mark Lowen in Kyiv. ""I was thinking what would happen if I would receive a message that Maks has died, what would I do?"" Read Mark Lowen's full interview with Olena here. Also in Mariupol - an elderly Jewish woman who survived the city's Nazi occupation in World War Two is among the city's residents reported to have died. Vanda Semyonovna Obiedkova was sheltering in a freezing cold Mariupol basement without water with her family when she died, her daughter says. Over eighty years ago Vanda - then aged 10 - survived capture by Nazi officers by hiding in a cellar in the same city. One of Russia's best known businessmen has called the invasion a ""crazy war"" and lambasted the ""massacre"" he said was happening in Ukraine. Oleg Tinkov, who is not currently in Russia, made the comments in a profanity-littered Instagram post. It makes Mr Tinkov one of the highest-profile Russians to publicly criticise President Vladimir Putin's decision to launch the invasion. Berlin will phase out Russian oil imports completely by the end of 2022, the country's top diplomat has announced. Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said that Russian gas would soon go too - part of an EU-wide plan to end energy dependence on Moscow ""well before 2030"". Germany is one of the EU countries most dependent on Russian energy, so phasing out its use will come with economic costs. According to one estimate, over one-third of German crude oil came from Russia in 2021. "

In his Instagram post, Mr Tinkov said 90% of Russians were against the war in Ukraine and added ""morons in any country are 10%"". ""I don't see a SINGLE beneficiary of this insane war! Innocent people and soldiers are dying,"" Mr Tinkov added. ""Waking up with a hangover, the generals realised that they have a shit army. ""And how will the army be good, if everything else in the country is shitty and mired in nepotism, sycophancy and servility?"" Before Russia invaded Ukraine in late February, Mr Tinkov's wealth had been estimated at more than $4.4bn (£3.4bn). But he has since lost his billionaire status as shares in his bank have plummeted, Forbes reported last month.

They were outnumbered and running out of supplies, Major Serhiy Volyna said. A Russian deadline for the surrender of Ukrainian forces has passed with no sign that the troops have complied. The last holdouts are sheltering in the city's huge Azovstal steel plant, reportedly with 1,000 civilians. Kyiv said there was a tentative deal to rescue some civilians from the city. The city's mayor, Vadym Boichenko, told national TV that Ukraine had hoped to send 90 buses to evacuate about 6,000 people on Wednesday. He said around 100,000 people are trapped in Mariupol. However, regional governor Pavlo Kyrylenko subsequently said that fewer buses than planned were able to reach trapped civilians and not many were evacuated. ""People of course gathered at the agreed meeting points, but few of them got onto the buses,"" he told Reuters news agency without giving specific figures. The Azovstal Iron and Steel Works - a massive, four sq-mile (10 sq km) plant in the south-east of the city - has become the last centre of the Ukrainian resistance in Mariupol. It is unclear how many Ukrainian troops remain in the city, but in a video message sent to the BBC, Maj Volyna, said around 500 injured troops were being cared for at the steel plant. Maj Volyna, who leads the 36th marine battalion, said his troops were running low on supplies and that the video marked ""our last address to the world. It may be our last one ever"". He said that Russian forces outnumbered his own by ""dozens of times,"" and that while Ukrainian morale remains high, Moscow's forces ""prevail in the air, in artillery, in ground troops, and in machines and tanks"". As Russian forces advanced slowly into the heart of Mariupol, the sprawling Azovstal complex became a home to thousands of Ukrainian soldiers, including fighters from the Azov battalion - a controversial national guard unit with links to the far-right. The site is a mass of tunnels and workshops, and provides a natural advantage to defenders. Yan Gagin, an official with the separatist Donetsk People's Republic, told Russian state news network RIA Novosti over the weekend that there is ""basically another city"" beneath the plant. Russia has been bombarding the factory with artillery and air raids, and Moscow has issued two demands for the troops to surrender. An advisor to President Volodymyr Zelensky said Russia is targeting the defenders with bunker busters - colossal bombs designed to penetrate thick armour and kill targets underground. This is the second ultimatum Ukrainian troops at the plant have faced this week. Despite this, and the vicious nature of the Russian siege, Ukraine's defence ministry said not a single soldier surrendered when a similar ultimatum lapsed on Monday. Are you in Mariupol - or do you have relatives or friends who remain in the city? If it's safe: Deputy Mayor Orlov warned that basic supplies at the plant have almost run out. ""They have an absolute lack of everything. A lack of water, food, medicines, help, and Russia totally blocks everything, any humanitarian help or evacuation,"" he told the BBC's Newshour programme. Olena Nikulina's cousin is fighting with Ukrainian forces in Mariupol. She said her last contact with him had been on 8 March when he told her his unit had ""very little food and medical supplies - and it's harder and harder to treat wounded soldiers"". Ukrainian officials say around 100,000 civilians remain in the city, which has been almost totally levelled by the Russian bombardment. Several previous attempts to organise humanitarian corridors from the city have failed, with both Russia and Ukraine accusing each other of bad faith in negotiations and refusals to guarantee compliance with ceasefires. But Ms Vereshchuk said Moscow has agreed to allow 6,000 people to evacuate the city on Wednesday. Ukraine has previously alleged that Russia has been forcibly evacuating thousands of Ukrainian civilians from the city into Russia. US defence officials said on Tuesday that around 76 battalion tactical groups - combined Russian armour, infantry and air defence units - are operating inside Ukraine, with around 12 of these focused on the assault in Mariupol. If the city were to fall it would free up around 10,000 troops to take part in the refocused Russian assault on the Donbas region, and allow Moscow to link up its forces on the annexed Crimean Peninsula with separatist forces in the east. If Mariupol was seized, Russia would also end up with full control of the Sea of Azov, cutting off its maritime trade and further isolating it from the world. The fall of Mariupol would also offer President Vladimir Putin a major propaganda opportunity. His forces have only captured one major Ukrainian city - Kherson - and seizing Mariupol would enable the Kremlin to show its population that Russia was achieving its aims and making progress. Capturing the Azov battalion would also allow Mr Putin to play into his baseless narrative that the Ukrainian government has been overrun by ""Nazis"". "

Vanda Semyonovna Obiedkova, 91, was sheltering without water in a freezing basement when she died on 4 April. More than 80 years ago she had hidden in a cellar during Mariupol's Nazi occupation. This time she was taking shelter from Russian forces who have bombarded the city and cut off essential supplies. ""Mama didn't deserve such a death,"" her daughter Larissa told Chabad.org. ""There was no water, no electricity, no heat - and it was unbearably cold,"" said Larissa, who was in the basement hiding with her mother. ""There was nothing we could do for her. We were living like animals."" Any moment spent outside the cellar was risky, with two snipers installed near the closest water sources, and the unrelenting bombardment from the sky. ""Every time a bomb fell, the entire building shook. My mother kept saying she didn't remember anything like this during the Great Patriotic War [World War Two]."" Born in 1930, Vanda was just 10 years old when Nazi occupiers arrived in the port city and rounded up its Jewish population in October 1941. Soldiers marched thousands of residents, including Vanda's own mother, to a ditch where they were executed in a mass grave. The little girl escaped by hiding in a basement when German SS officers arrived at her home to take away her mother. She survived the rest of Mariupol's Nazi occupation by spending the next two years in a hospital, which her father - who was not Jewish - had managed to get her checked in to. Ms Obiedkova is the second Ukrainian Holocaust survivor known to have died since the Russian invasion began. In March, a 96-year-old concentration camp survivor died when Russian forces shelled the apartment block he was living in, his relatives said. ""Vanda Semyonovna lived through unimaginable horrors,"" Mariupol's rabbi Mendel Cohen said. ""She was a kind, joyous woman, a special person who will forever remain in our hearts."" Larissa and her surviving family members are now said to be in a safe location. Mariupol's mayor says 100,000 people remain trapped in the eastern port city, which has been under intense Russian bombardment since the beginning of the invasion. The BBC has been unable to verify the figure independently. The city is a key strategic target for Moscow, which if captured would free up thousands of Russian troops to take part in offensives elsewhere and allow Russian forces in annexed Crimea to link directly with separatist forces in the east. Despite multiple ultimatums from Russia, Ukrainian defenders have remained camped out in Mariupol's massive Azovstal steel complex where they've vowed to fight to the end. "

Katarina, her husband and their three young children, have moved into her sister Liza Cherney's home in Wolverhampton. She said leaving Kyiv had been ""the hardest decision"" of her life but hoped to return in the future. Ms Cherney said the family had taken a ""chance"" to try and find safe passage out of the country. Katarina said they began making plans to leave as soon as the war began, but did not flee until 10 days later. ""I tried to not show my children that I am scared,"" she said. She added it was ""really nice"" to be in the UK, because her children could ""live their... lives"". ""We are here... we don't hear the bombs and everything is okay and thanks to my sister that we can be here,"" she said. Ms Cherney has moved in with her boyfriend and his mother in order to provide her sister's family with her flat. After living in the UK for 14 years, she said it was ""devastating"" to be listening to news of the war while her family were still in Ukraine. ""You feel helpless,"" she said. The fast-changing situation meant, even though she was in contact with her relatives, she did not know what would be happening from one moment to the next. It took Katarina and her family four days to get to the Hungarian border, she said. ""Her husband spent a lot of time online just listening to the radio almost circling the spots on the map where it was a safe route to take,"" Ms Cherney said. ""But even that was a chance, because whatever was safe may not be safe half an hour later."" They then travelled to Austria and made their applications to come to the UK. Ms Cherney said their parents, who have been separated for 10 years, were now living together in her sister's house as her father was too unwell to travel.

Boris Johnson has been under fire after nominating his friend, who became an independent peer in July 2020. Last month, MPs voted for documents on the decision to be published, but Lord Bew denied any interference to his committee's process. He told MPs: ""There was no pressure on this issue from No 10 or the prime minister."" While the confidential information on the decision has yet to be made public, Lord Bew hinted it could emerge ""in the coming days"". Newspaper owner Lord Lebedev is the Russian-born son of a KGB agent Alexander Lebedev, and fresh questions arose about the security risk he could pose to the UK after Russia's invasion of Ukraine. He denied posing a ""security risk"" to the country and he backed the publication of the security advice, tweeting: ""I have nothing to hide."" Labour claimed the House of Lords Appointment Committee (HOLAC) - which Lord Bew chairs - advised the PM against giving the businessman the honour. The party says it changed its mind after Boris Johnson overruled security service concerns. The Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs Committee, made up of MPs, is looking into the role of HOLAC after the controversy surrounding Lord Lebedev's peerage. Mr Johnson is known to have been aware of security service concerns, with former No 10 adviser Dominic Cummings saying he was ""in the room"" when the prime minister was told intelligence officials had ""serious reservations"" about the move. Another source has confirmed to the BBC that concerns were raised by security services. Giving evidence to MPs, Lord Bew said there was ""uncertainty"" around Lord Lebedev's case, and a ""special set of circumstances"" when it came to the businessman - pointing to his father's former job. ""It would be ridiculous not to say that this isn't a case of particular complexity with many wrinkles to it,"" he said. ""How much is someone responsible for his father etc?"" But he claimed Lord Lebedev went through the usual vetting process and no-one interfered with the committee's work. ""At no other point was there pressure placed on us on this case,"" he said. Lord Bew also denied trying to block the peerage, saying rather than warning against appointing him, the committee merely warned about a public backlash. The chair confirmed a letter to No 10, saying: ""You are going to have to take the flak for it if you go ahead."" Lord Bew added: ""We are uncomfortable with the use of the word 'warning' with respect to any of the advice we have ever received from any of the agencies [on peerage applications]. ""What we get are facts which we are asked to interpret and reflect upon."" He did admit HOLAC ""needed clarification"" on what was sent to them by security services on Lord Lebedev, and the response took ""weeks"". But he said: ""You know we did not say no to the prime minister [on Lebedev] - you know the bottom line. as the Americans would say."" "

Aiden Aslin, 28, from Newark, Nottinghamshire, had been defending the battered city of Mariupol. In a statement his family denounced ""Kremlin propaganda"" adding he was not a ""volunteer, a mercenary, or a spy"". They said he moved to Mykolaiv in 2018 where he met his girlfriend and joined the Ukrainian Marines. The family spoke through a statement released by their MP Robert Jenrick on Twitter. They said: ""Aiden was making plans for his future outside the military, but like all Ukrainians, his life was turned upside down by Putin's barbarous invasion. ""He has played his part in defending Ukraine's right to self-determination."" Mr Aslin has appeared in video footage after his unit was reportedly captured. His family said it was ""deeply distressing"" to see him looking bruised and swollen. They said: ""Using images and videos of prisoners of war is in contravention of the Geneva Convention and must stop. ""Aiden is a much-loved young man with a strong network of friends around him and a loving wife-to-be."" His grandmother previously said she thought his captors were using him ""for propaganda purposes"". The family said they were in contact with the Foreign Office. Mr Jenrick raised his concerns about the footage in Parliament during Prime Minister's Questions. He asked Boris Johnson if he agreed that broadcasting it was a ""flagrant breach of the Geneva Convention"". The Newark MP said the way Mr Aslin was being treated was illegal and the person conducting the interview was in danger of prosecution for war crimes. He also criticised online platforms that were used to show the footage and said the videos should be taken down. Mr Johnson said he echoed his Conservative colleague's comments about those that broadcast ""propaganda messages"". Follow BBC East Midlands on Facebook, on Twitter, or on Instagram.

593,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-cambridgeshire-61163586,2022-04-20T12:17:37,Children from Ukrainian family in businessman's home start school," Two Ukrainian children who fled the city of Kharkiv with their family have started school in the UK. The pair are part of a four-generation family of 10 which moved to a village near Cambourne, Cambridgeshire offered by a businessman. They came to the UK under the Ukraine Family Scheme, helped by a relative who is a British citizen. The mother of one of the children said she was ""very emotional"" about their first day at Caldecote Primary School. The family, ranging in age from 10 to 90, arrived in the UK last month. Eight of them took a flight from Albania to London Luton Airport, while two came by car and ferry, arriving four days later with their belongings and two dogs. They moved into a property provided by Mick Swinhoe, 52, who said he bought it as a ""project"" but offered it to provide refuge to a Ukrainian family saying it was ""better use"". One of the children's mothers, Valeriia, 37, said the pair were given worksheets in English, with Ukrainian translations, as they arrived at the school and hung up their coats and bags. ""It's like the first day ever at school for them,"" she said. ""They're really scared, but it's alright."" Valeriia added that they were ""nervous"" but she hoped they would soon pick up English. ""My hopes are that it will be easy for them,"" she said. She added they had been worried because they were not allowed to use mobile phones and therefore could not use a translating app but ""prepared themselves a little bit"" by writing out common phrases. Valeriia said the children had also been concerned about school uniforms because in Ukraine they could wear whatever they wanted. ""They cried about this, they didn't want to wear uniforms, they wanted to have personality,"" she said. ""But then I explained it has to be done, everyone is wearing that."" Valeriia's 12-year-old daughter is due to start at Comberton Village College secondary school near Cambridge in the coming days. She said the community had donated much of what they needed - including stationery, notebooks and lunchboxes and said she was ""so grateful"" for the help.

""I was thinking what would happen if I would receive a message that Maks has died, what would I do?"", she says. ""And I just started crying in the middle of the street because I don't have any answer to that."" We are sitting in the office of her volunteer centre in Kyiv, where boxes of supplies - food, medical kits and armoured vests - are being gathered to be sent off to Ukrainian forces on the eastern front: the epicentre of the Russian offensive. Her sense of purpose is twofold: her nation and her family, with her 26-year-old cousin Maksim, or Maks for short, fighting in Mariupol. The boy she grew up with, whom she describes as a kind and respectful engineering student, is one of the last remaining Ukrainian defenders holed up in the Azovstal steel plant in the city, somehow withstanding the ferocious firepower of one of the world's biggest armies. Perhaps a couple of thousand soldiers and civilians are there, in the Cold War-era network of bunkers and tunnels, where food, water and time are running out. For more than a month she had no word from him but spoke to him briefly this week. ""He never told us about the real conditions, probably he didn't want to upset us"", she says. ""But they have very little food and medical supplies - and it's harder and harder to treat wounded soldiers."" Growing up in Sumy, north-eastern Ukraine, Maks's mother - Olena's aunt - wanted him to join the army, calling it ""a school of life for men"". When he was called to fight in Mariupol, she was initially relieved, thinking the city, a little further along the coast from the occupied territories of the Donbas, would be spared the worst. But Russia is determined to establish a land corridor through eastern Ukraine to Crimea - and that would have to run through Mariupol. And so Russian forces have besieged it for some seven weeks. Ukraine's President Volodymr Zelensky said tens of thousands may have died in the city. ""I feel terrible about him being there"", says Olena, struggling to hold back her tears. ""First of all, I feel very sorry about not speaking to him as much as I could while we still had a connection. It felt terrible when my aunt sent me a message at 06:00 to say that Maks' friend was probably dead and she's so worried about him."" I ask of the pride she must feel towards the boy who used to drive her in his car - and became a Ukrainian fighter who refused Russia's demands to surrender. ""I would have never imagined my cousin to become a true hero of Ukraine and of Mariupol"", she replies with a smile. ""It's obviously a very bitter sense of pride in the sense that he's in a life-threatening situation. I dream of the day he will return and I will be able to tell this to him."" On the shelves in the volunteer centre are spoils of war: Russian soldiers' equipment, downed missiles and fragments of a Russian fighter jet that the Ukrainians proudly exhibit as symbols of an invasion that has so far not gone Moscow's way. But the Kremlin will surely be determined that the eastern offensive does not repeat the mistakes of the west, from where Russian troops have now retreated. Russian President Vladimir Putin is thought likely to want a tangible gain by 9 May - the annual commemoration of Victory Day against Nazi Germany - and Mariupol could serve him that. That's a fear shared by another relative, Vladimir Vasilyuk, whose 23-year-old son Danilo is also fighting in the Azovstal plant. They're still in regular contact. ""The boys are lacking ammunition"", Vladimir says, ""but they don't want to leave because they're protecting the civilians - they don't want to abandon them."" His composed, almost impassive look begins to break as he talks more of his only child, lowering his eyes with a sharp intake of breath. ""I don't sleep at night"", he admits. ""If I had a chance to go there, I would. I don't think the city is worth the loss of his life. But the boys made their choice. ""Maybe it's my fault that he joined the army, because I always took him to training and I prepared him for it"", he adds. ""His main goal was always to make our country better."" We stand beneath a monument in Kyiv covered up by sandbags spray painted in the blue and yellow of the Ukrainian flag. The bells of the golden-domed St Michael's Church chime five. ""I am sure we will see each other again"", Vladimir says, ""it's a matter of time. But if I could pass a message to him now it would be that I love him and I'm waiting for him."" "
598,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-61155035,2022-04-20T00:13:37,Ukraine war: Kyiv's allies pledge more weapons to help win war," Ukraine's allies have pledged to send more weapons to help it defend against a renewed Russian offensive. The US and others vowed to send artillery, anti-tank and air defence aid to Kyiv during a 90-minute video call on Tuesday. Ukraine says it needs the weapons to help defend itself as Russia launched a new campaign in the country's east. Clashes there have marked what Ukraine leader Volodymyr Zelensky said was the start of the ""battle for the Donbas"". The eastern Donbas - which comprises the Luhansk and Donetsk regions - is where Russia is concentrating its efforts. According to Ukraine, Russian forces have been attacking Ukrainian positions along the entire 300-mile (480km) front line since Monday. It was amid these renewed attacks that Western leaders met to discuss further military assistance for Ukraine. Following the meeting, the US defence department said additional military aircraft and aircraft parts had been sent to Ukraine to increase their fleet size and repair others in Ukraine's arsenal that were damaged. The US defence department added that the US had not provided aircraft to Kyiv itself, and did not provide details on which countries have provided the aircraft. President Zelensky has been appealing to the US for Soviet-made air defence systems and fighter jets as an alternative to a no-fly zone over Ukraine. Last month, the US refused a proposal by Poland to provide it with MiG-29 fighter jets, which it would then transfer to Ukraine. President Joe Biden, speaking to reporters after the meeting between Western allies, added that the US is planning to provide a further military aid package to Ukraine of a similar size to the $800m (£615m) aid package he announced last week, according to US media. He said Washington would also be sending Ukraine more artillery - heavy guns deployed in land warfare. Other countries also pledged to help Ukraine with further military assistance during the meeting. ""They [Ukraine] need support with more artillery, that is what we will be giving them,"" said the UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson in parliament after the meeting. In Berlin, Chancellor Olaf Scholz said Germany was providing finance to enable Ukraine to buy anti-tank weapons and ammunition from German arms manufacturers. Meanwhile, the Czech Republic said it would repair Ukrainian tanks and armoured vehicles when they are damaged in combat. Further economic sanctions against Russia was another topic on the agenda. The arms pledges follow persistent calls from President Zelensky for allies to increase their weapons supplies to Kyiv. ""We need heavy artillery, armed vehicles, air defence systems and combat aircraft — anything to repel Russian forces and stop their war crimes,"" Mr Zelensky said on Twitter last week. ""Nobody will stop Russia except Ukraine with heavy weapons"". Russia fiercely opposes such assistance. ""The United States and Western states under its control are doing everything to drag out the military operation for as long as possible,"" Russia's defence chief Sergei Shoigu said. The leaders also discussed how to provide security guarantees to Ukraine after the war even if it is not a member of Nato, a French presidential advisor said. Nato is a military alliance whose 30 members - including the US, UK and Germany - have agreed to come to one another's aid in the event of an armed attack against any one of them. Since Ukraine is not a Nato member, the alliance isn't obliged to come to its defence. Its members fear that involving themselves in direct armed confrontation could lead to an all-out conflict between Russia and the West. Instead, Nato members have supplied Ukraine with millions of dollars worth of military aid since Russia launched the invasion. "

There were clashes along a front line spanning hundreds of miles, as the battle for the Donbas region entered a critical stage. While this new offensive had been expected after Russia failed to seize the capital Kyiv, it could bear huge importance on how the war plays out. That's because, if Russia conquers the Donbas, it would allow President Vladimir Putin to claim some achievement from the invasion. But Tuesday's clashes showed that Ukraine's forces are still able to hold firm, and the country's President Volodymyr Zelensky - in reference to the east - pledged to ""not give up anything Ukrainian"". Want to know more about why Russia is targeting the Donbas? You can read our explainer here. And if you're unsure about the geography of the region - this map illustrates where Russian troops have advanced so far. The new Russian offensive in the east led to a swift response from Ukraine's allies. They vowed to send artillery, anti-tank and air defence aid to Kyiv during a 90-minute video call on Tuesday. The virtual meeting included US President Joe Biden, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, as well as the leaders of France, Italy, Japan and Germany among others. ""The aim is to strengthen the Ukrainian military such that it can push back the Russian attack,"" German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said. As well as weapons, the leaders also agreed to impose further sanctions on Moscow. You can read our full story on the call here. With a surge in military action on Tuesday, and yet more pledges from world leaders, it can be easy to overlook the way this war has transformed lives in Ukraine. But an entire generation of young people in the country are cut off from living a normal childhood as the conflict rages on. The UN estimates that around two thirds of Ukraine's 7.8 million children have been displaced. Our correspondent Yogita Limaye spoke to the family of one child - Elisei Ryabukon - who was killed by Russian soldiers. ""The Russians gave us permission to leave. They even waved us goodbye and wished us luck,"" his mother, Inna, said. ""Then when we were crossing a field, they started firing at us from every direction."" Read the moving piece here. This war continues to take a major emotional toll on those abroad who are unable to connect with family and friends in Ukraine. Ukrainian citizen Peter Chumak has lived in London for 22 years, but went back to Ukraine for family reasons shortly before Russia invaded. Martial law was introduced minutes before Peter tried to cross the border into Poland and he was ordered to remain in Ukraine. After seven weeks in his homeland, he has been allowed to return to the UK. You can watch the moment he was reunited with his family below. "

This means the UK will no longer be the fastest growing economy in the G7 group of leading Western nations, and will be the slowest in 2023, it says. The body says that UK growth will slow as price pressures lead households to cut spending, while rising interest rates are expected to ""cool investment"". The UK's economy is now predicted to grow by 3.7% this year, down from the previous forecast of 4.7% made in January. However, next year, the UK is expected to have the slowest growth in the G7 and across Europe's main economies, at just 1.2%, a near halving from the 2.3% expected previously. The 2023 UK figure is the slowest apart from heavily-sanctioned Russia in the wider G20 grouping, which includes nations such as China and India. The IMF said that the UK was the fastest growing G7 economy in 2021, and is forecast to be the second fastest in 2022. The low UK growth rates forecast in 2023 are in part due to the UK rebounding more quickly from the pandemic than some of its G7 peers. However, the UK is also wrestling with high inflation, which will hit growth in 2023, as people cut spending as their real income shrinks, the IMF said. The organisation expects inflation to peak in late 2022 at 9%. It said rising interest rates will also slow the UK economy in 2023 and 2023, while government policies such as getting rid of certain tax breaks will reduce business investment at that time. In addition, Brexit will hold back export growth, the IMF said, and it will continue to make pandemic-related labour supply ""scarring"" worse by reducing immigration. ""However, the impact of Brexit is spread over several years and is not the primary driver of the slowdown in 2023,"" a spokesperson for the organisation added. The IMF works with its 189 member countries to try to stabilise the global economy, including issuing short-term loans and assistance to countries who are struggling. It said inflation was now a ""clear and present danger"" in many countries and the situation has added to supply strains from the coronavirus pandemic. ""In the matter of a few weeks, the world has yet again experienced a major, transformative shock,"" IMF director of research Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas wrote in the organisation's 2022 World Economic Outlook. ""Just as a durable recovery from the pandemic-induced global economic collapse appeared in sight, the war has created the very real prospect that a large part of the recent gains will be erased."" The organisation said it expected global growth of just 3.6% this year, down nearly a percentage point from its forecast before the war. The World Bank also said it was lowering its growth forecast from 4.1% to 3.2%. The conflict has already devastated the economies of Ukraine and Russia, which the West cut off from key trade and financial networks with sanctions following the invasion. Ukraine is facing a severe contraction of 35% or more this year, while Russia's economy is expected to shrink by 8.5%, the IMF said. But with Russia a major energy producer and key supplier of staples such as wheat and corn alongside Ukraine, the consequences will ripple far beyond their borders, the IMF warned. There have been two acute shocks to the world economy in quick succession - the pandemic and the Ukraine war. The latter is building on the problems created by the former, tripping up what had been a healthy recovery, and sending prices rising at an even faster rate. Food and energy prices were already being hiked by the supply bottlenecks after the pandemic, before one of the world's biggest energy suppliers invaded one of the world's biggest food exporter. But now there are new bottlenecks emerging from the stringent Covid lockdowns in some regions of China. Rising prices risk social stability in poorer countries, dependent on food imports. Fears about inflation becoming entrenched are leading the world's central bankers to raise interest rates. In turn that is raising the cost of borrowing for the record debts many nations racked up during the pandemic. So all this requires some skill and cooperation among the old and new financial powerhouses of the world. But that has been another commodity in short supply in recent times. ""The economic effects of the war are spreading far and wide - like seismic waves that emanate from the epicenter of an earthquake,"" it said. In Germany, where the economy is especially closely entwined, the war is likely to lower growth by 1.7 percentage points, it said. Even in countries with little direct trade with Russia and Ukraine, households will feel the effects of the war, as central banks respond to the more rapid inflation by raising interest rates, making borrowing more expensive, the IMF said. In the US, for example, the organisation lowered its forecast for growth in 2022 by 0.3 percentage points to 3.7%, citing the prospect of more aggressive interest rate rises. Overall, inflation pressures are significantly worse than they were when the IMF issued its previous forecast in January. It now predicts inflation in ""advanced economies"" will hit 5.7% this year, while it is likely to reach 8.7% in emerging markets. UK inflation is expected to be 5.3% next year - the highest in the G7, and higher than all EU members, and only exceeded in the G20 by crisis-ridden Argentina, Turkey and Russia. ""Inflation has become a clear and present danger for many countries,"" Mr Gourinchas wrote in a blog. A few countries, such as oil exporters, are benefiting. The IMF expects growth in Saudi Arabia, for example, to be stronger than it did in January. But the risks are not purely economic, the IMF added. It said the war had also created a refugee crisis and aggravated political tensions, risking a ""more permanent fragmentation of the world economy into geopolitical blocks with distinct technology standards, cross-border payment systems, and reserve currencies"". ""Such a 'tectonic shift' would cause long-run efficiency losses, increase volatility and represent a major challenge to the rules-based framework that has governed international and economic relations for the last 75 years,"" the IMF said. A Treasury spokesperson said the IMF forecasts ""will be concerning for many people and families"" in the UK. ""However the support we provided over the past two years has put our economy in a good position to deal with these headwinds, including through record numbers of employees on payrolls and a strong economic recovery from the pandemic,"" the spokesperson said. Labour's shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves said the IMF forecast ""shows the extreme challenges facing the UK economy"". ""While it is true that global forces play a role, the fact that the UK is forecast to have the slowest growth of any G7 economy next year plus the highest inflation, shows the uniquely bad situation the UK is in. ""Inflation spiralling out of control this year has created a cost of living crisis hitting families across the country, needing decisive and urgent action,"" she said, repeating Labour calls for a windfall tax on oil and gas firms. Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesperson Christine Jardine said the UK government had ""failed to shield the UK from spiralling energy bills and soaring inflation, but they have gone ahead with raising people's taxes to their highest point in 70 years"".

Russian and Ukrainian forces clashed on Tuesday along the eastern front line, after Mr Zelensky said the battle for the Donbas had begun. Ukraine's top security official, Oleksiy Danilov, said Russia was trying break through Ukrainian defensive positions throughout Ukraine's east. The offensive had been expected after Russia failed to seize Kyiv. After its push to overrun the capital stalled, Moscow announced its military would focus instead on eastern Ukraine where Russian-backed separatists have been fighting Ukrainian forces since 2014. Luhansk is one of the most fiercely contested regions, and on Tuesday its Governor Serhiy Hayday said it had come under attack from all sides. He announced that street fighting in the city of Kreminna had forced Ukrainian troops to withdraw and regroup, leaving Russian forces in control of the eastern city of 18,000. ""They moved in but our defenders had to retreat,"" Mr Hayday said. ""The enemy was shelling every metre of our defence line."" The strategic port city of Mariupol, meanwhile, has come under intense bombardment. Pro-Russian forces have reportedly begun an attempt to storm the city's Azovstal steelworks, where Mariupol's final defenders have been holding out for days. Ukraine says civilians and children are among those holed up in the complex, but pro-Russian officials in the city have disputed this. Mariupol is a key Russian target which if captured would allow its troops to complete a land-bridge between the occupied Crimean peninsula and separatist held regions of eastern Ukraine. In Kharkiv, which is 400km (249 miles) away in Ukraine's north-east, officials said three people had been killed and 21 injured in a new wave of attacks on the city. ""The intensity of the shelling of Kharkiv has increased,"" the regional governor Oleg Sinegubov said in a post on Telegram. Russia initially appeared to want to capture major Ukrainian cities and topple the country's government. But after facing stiff resistance, Russian defence officials said that its main objectives in the ""first stage of the operation"" had been ""generally accomplished"" and its forces were moved from areas around the capital. They announced plans to redirect the focus of the invasion towards the ""liberation"" of the mostly Russian-speaking Donbas region. Russia's President Vladmir Putin has portrayed the invasion as an attempt to demilitarise and ""denazify"" Ukraine, something Ukraine and its allies dismiss as a ruse for an unprovoked attack. Russian defence officials said its forces struck more than 1,200 targets in Ukraine on Monday night, including 25 military command posts in Mykolayiv and Kirovsk as well as two weapon depots in east Ukraine. Describing the fresh offensive in a television interview, Moscow's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said ""another stage of this operation is beginning, and I'm sure this will be a very important moment."" Speaking in a video message on Monday night, Mr Zelensky said that his forces had pledged to ""not give up anything Ukrainian"". ""A very large part of the entire Russian army is now focused on this offensive,"" he added, but said that Ukraine's forces will fight on ""no matter how many Russian troops are driven there, we will fight"". Moscow claimed last month that it controlled 93% of Luhansk and 54% of Donetsk and its forces are expected to try and encircle the remaining Ukrainian troops in the region. But they face a protracted fight with some of Kyiv's most battle-hardened troops. Ukraine is believed to have between 40-50,000 soldiers in the Donbas, many of whom have spent years fighting against Russian-backed separatists forces in the region. The change in Russia's objectives was set out by President Vladimir Putin during a speech last week, where he announced that his aim was ""to help the people who live in the Donbas, who feel their unbreakable bond with Russia"". The Pentagon's press secretary, John Kirby, cautioned Russia could be ""setting the conditions for future offensive operations"" and officials in Kyiv warned that the new Russian offensive does not mean that Moscow has ended its attacks on other parts of Ukraine. ""Putin hasn't removed the goal to destroy us as a state and our political leadership,"" Mr Danilov said in an interview with Ukrainian TV. Are you in Ukraine? Is your family?

A six-strong crew from Suffolk Fire and Rescue Service set off from Ipswich East station on Tuesday. They will deliver engines and equipment to the Polish Fire Service, who will donate them to stations most in need. Suffolk's chief fire officer said the service was ""devastated"" by the losses experienced by fire teams in Ukraine. Jon Lacey said: ""The Ukrainian Fire Service so far... has seen 100 fire stations and 250 fire engines needlessly destroyed in the conflict. ""We are pleased to be able to support the national effort to assist our counterparts at this difficult time by replacing some of the damaged kit."" He added that his staff had been working ""round the clock"" to ensure all the equipment was ready to be deployed and used immediately in Ukraine. The donated engines, now replaced by more environmentally-friendly ones, had been based at stations including Ipswich, Bury St Edmunds, Beccles, Felixstowe and Long Melford. The crew will drive to Kent to join a national convoy of vehicles heading for Ukraine. Firefighters Graham Abrey, Jason Anderson, Jake Booth, Paul Buck, Matt Hassey and Sean Ryan have all received extensive driver and mechanical training for their week-long journey, as well as advice from staff who joined previous convoys. Mr Ryan said: ""I am proud to be supporting our firefighter colleagues in Ukraine with this much-needed kit. ""I had my first blue light drive on one of the fire engines we are taking there, so it will be extra special for me to hand it over in Poland."" Suffolk's donation forms part of the wider National Fire Chiefs' Council and Fire Aid initiative.

Commons international development committee chairwoman Sarah Champion said she was ""shocked and disappointed"" that less than £60m had been disbursed. She said people needed ""help now"". Foreign Secretary Liz Truss told the committee on 1 April that the delivery of aid was being scaled up ""at speed"". Ms Truss said her department was ""working tirelessly to disburse our funding quickly and effectively"" while ensuring that all aid was targeted effectively. Latest figures have not been yet made available on how much the situation has moved on in the 18 days since she made that statement to the committee. But in a newly-issued statement Labour's Ms Champion said she had previously urged the prime minister to make sure the UK's pledges were distributed quickly and said it was ""shameful"" that she was having to repeat the urgent appeal. The Rotherham MP said she was ""extremely disappointed"" that support for Ukraine was coming from an aid budget which had been cut from 0.7% of national income to 0.5%, which she said would mean ""cruel cuts"" to aid programmes around the world. ""Given these circumstances the government should be less rigid in sticking to the 0.5% target for aid spending,"" she said, adding this would allow the UK to respond to the crisis in Ukraine without taking resources away from other communities suffering from other conflicts or extreme poverty. She said more than 12 million people in Ukraine needed humanitarian support, as well as four million who had fled the country. Ms Champion said she was sure the British people who had ""given so quickly and generously"" to the separate Ukraine appeal by the Disasters Emergency Committee would be ""astounded"" by the lack of speed of the government's aid delivery. A spokesperson for the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office said the UK had been ""at the forefront of the humanitarian response"". They added: ""We have dispersed millions of items of food and medical supplies to people in need across the country."" "

Dr Lisa de Rijk and Rhian Price are psychotherapy counsellors who specialise in a treatment developed after the 9/11 attacks. They are training other counsellors to help compatriots in Ukraine who have post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). ""That was the best gift we could give them,"" said Dr de Rijk. The pair, both from Gwynedd, said they were stunned by the dedication of those taking part. One counsellor was participating in the web-based course from her car after fleeing to Switzerland. Another had to be persuaded to leave her Zoom session to go to a bomb shelter as an air raid siren began to sound. Dr de Rijk from Nant Peris decided to act after talking to a Polish psychotherapist and a pro-government worker in Ukraine who was asking for help. She contacted other counsellors who were trained to provide Reconsolidation of Traumatic Memories (RTM) treatment, and a team of 11 practitioners from England, Wales, Northern Ireland, Poland, New Mexico and Florida was created. Soon they were delivering three days of intensive training to 28 therapists from Ukraine. Many were still living in the country, although some had fled to Poland. Dr de Rijk said: ""The 28 turned up the first day looking white, totally shell shocked and showing no emotional expression, and we worked with them as professionals. ""In the end you saw the warmth in them, they had regained their professional identity which meant they were then able to go back to their daily work, and to their daily lives with skills to help their compatriots."" Ms Price uses the RTM technique, developed by psychotherapist Dr Frank Bourke from the United States, in her daily work in the Bangor area, helping people with PTSD. She said the team did not discuss the personal experiences of the individuals taking part in the course. ""We had always been professional but, at the end, when we were saying goodbye, people were starting to talk about what had happened to them,"" she said. Some of those who completed the course have already started helping others, including those suffering some of the worst experiences in the conflict with Russia, in the east of the country. A team of academics at King's College, London, is researching how the project might lead to similar assistance programmes in the future. Dr de Rijk, a visiting research fellow at the university, said: ""We want to show that we have been able to give people in a war-torn country new skills, that it is effective, and can be done without money, with dedicated volunteers, and that we have had professional results.""

He broke down, over and over again, before he could finish. His wife Inna, steeling herself, adjusted the framed photo of a smiling, young boy placed on the coffin - a mother's last act of care. The boy was Elisei Ryabukon. He would have been 14 in May. Just over a month after he was killed in firing by Russian soldiers, his family, friends, neighbours and classmates gathered at a church in the city of Brovary in the east of Kyiv, to say goodbye to this much loved child from Peremoha village. A community that had been scattered by war, came together in grief. Elisei was remembered as honest, humble and helpful, a boy who didn't like to fight and who refused to play aggressive sport. Inna, Elisei and her younger son were stuck in Peremoha when the fighting started. ""On 11 March, the Russians gave us permission to leave. They even waved us goodbye and wished us luck. Then when we were crossing a field, they started firing at us from every direction,"" Inna said. There were five cars in the convoy of vehicles evacuating. Elisei was in the second car, in which no one survived. ""I crawled through the field and saved my three-year-old son by dragging him by the hood of his jacket. The fact that any of us made it out alive was pure luck,"" she said. She says her younger child is the only reason she's able to carry on. She's filed a complaint with the police and wants justice for Elisei's killing. ""I want the world to know about the crimes of Russia. I want every victim to be counted. I want Russia to be held accountable for the people, children and women, they have killed on our land,"" she said. Elisei is among more than two hundred children known to have been killed in Ukraine so far, according to the country's government. Hundreds more have been injured. Ohmatdyt hospital has received dozens of children wounded in the fighting. Six-year-old Daniil Avdeenko has been brought here from the northern city of Chernihiv, which had been surrounded and bombarded by Russian forces until they withdrew from the area at the start of April. Daniil and his parents were injured in mortar shelling just outside their home in a residential neighbourhood. When the explosion occurred, all of them were thrown to the ground. His father Oleksandr saw that his wife's leg was bleeding profusely. He used the strap of her bag as a tourniquet, an act that has saved her leg from being amputated. Oleksandr had called out to Daniil, who'd told him he was alright. But when the boy began to stand up Oleksandr realised how badly he was hurt. ""I saw that he had shrapnel all over his body, and he was bleeding a lot,"" he said. All three were taken to different hospitals. ""For the first four days we didn't know who was alive, and who wasn't. They didn't register my son's name when he was admitted to hospital,"" he said. Eventually the family was reunited, and brought to Kyiv for treatment. Daniil had shrapnel pieces in his head which were removed, but the bits lodged in his back are still there. Doctors say it will be too painful to remove them right now. The boy has multiple injuries and fractures in his leg. It's not clear when he'll be able to walk. For most part he's cheerful, but he lets out little cries of pain when a nurse comes to inject a medicine. ""He tells the nurses at the hospital the details of how we were all covered in blood. He remembers it all. But he blames himself. Just before it happened, I'd told him to go down to the basement with his mother. But he insisted on coming outside to me,"" says Oleksandr. ""I've explained to him that he's not guilty. We all have."" After the war started, Oleksandr says Daniil would ask lots of questions. ""When there was shooting, he would ask 'Dad who's shooting now?'. I'd say 'ours'. 'And now?', he'd ask. I'd tell him 'It's our men being attacked,' In the night, he would see tanks in his dreams. When bombs dropped from the sky, he would wake up frightened. But despite it all he would still have fun. After the attack though, he's changed drastically,"" says Oleksandr. Even those who've managed to flee physically unscathed, bear scars of psychological trauma. 13-year-old Ilya Bobkov escaped along with his family from Bucha just outside Kyiv, which was under Russian control for weeks. They managed to leave through a humanitarian corridor which was opened in March for civilians to be evacuated. His family now lives in one room in a rundown government building in Kyiv. ""On 24 February when the fighting started, I was shocked. I had expected it to be a regular day, I'd go to school, do my homework and play games. My mother came to my room and told me to pack a few things. Then we started living in our basement. It was very scary. It was hard to get through the nights,"" Ilya says. On their way to safety, Ilya and his family saw burning buildings, destroyed tanks and corpses along the way. ""I can't escape the feeling that the war is still all around us. I dream about my family being killed or taken hostage by the Russians. I wake up in cold sweat,"" Ilya says. His aunt Valentyna Solokova whose family evacuated along with Ilya's says they tried to keep the children distracted by playing games or looking at family photographs. They were also forced to have difficult conversations, especially when they were running low on food supplies. ""I'd tell the children that bread and water are the most important things. I had to make them understand that they lived one life before, where they had everything, they went to school and played games. And now they had to learn to live without all that,' she said. 'I told them the time has come for you to grow up."" A generation of children in Ukraine is cut off from a normal childhood at the moment. The UN estimates that around two thirds of the country's 7.8 million children have been displaced. With fighting raging in the south and east, and renewed shelling in Lviv and Kyiv, no part of Ukraine appears safe right now. It's unclear when the children of this country might be able to return to the life that was suddenly interrupted. "

That is as far as the warring sides may agree on - not what caused the sinking. The Russian defence ministry said ammunition onboard exploded in an unexplained fire and the ship tipped over while being towed back to port. Ukraine claims it struck the vessel with its Neptune missiles. Unnamed US officials have told US media they believe the Ukrainian version. The 510-crew warship had led Russia's naval assault on Ukraine, which made it an important symbolic and military target. Earlier in the conflict the Moskva gained notoriety after calling on Ukrainian border troops defending Snake Island in the Black Sea to surrender - to which they memorably radioed a message of refusal which loosely translates as ""go to hell"". Prior to the sinking, Russia's defence ministry issued a statement saying ""the vessel is seriously damaged. The entire crew have been evacuated"". Naval officials said they were towing the warship back to port. But a later statement the same day announced that on its journey back to port the ship ""lost its balance"". ""Given the choppy seas, the vessel sank,"" it said. Moscow again blamed the blast on an unexplained fire, making no mention of any missile strike. But Ukraine says it is responsible for an attack on the cruiser, which it claims it targeted with recently-introduced Ukrainian-made missiles. In a Facebook post before the ship sank, Ukrainian officials said Russian rescue efforts were being hampered by ammunition exploding on board and bad weather. On Friday, US officials said two Ukrainian Neptune missiles had struck the vessel, killing an unknown number of sailors. The BBC has not been able to verify the claims. Dramatic pictures and a credible video appearing to show the Russian warship listing heavily and billowing smoke have since appeared. Military experts told the BBC the footage most likely showed the Moskva cruiser and was probably recorded on 14 April. The damage that can be seen in the footage is consistent with the type that a Neptune-style missile attack would inflict, they agreed. Rear Admiral Chris Parry, who previously commanded a Royal Navy destroyer, said that after looking at the image he was left in ""no doubt it's been hit by one or two missiles"". But other experts said the footage didn't provide enough proof to definitively rule out another explanation not involving a missile strike. Russia has not admitted any casualties. On Saturday the Russian defence ministry published footage showing what it described as the crew of the Moskva, on parade in the Crimean port city of Sevastopol. The commander-in-chief of the Russian navy said the officers and crew would ""continue their service"". The video showing around 100 sailors is the only evidence that's been offered of any survivors from the 510-crew warship. Originally built in Ukraine in the Soviet-era, the vessel entered service in the early 1980s according to Russian media. The missile cruiser was previously deployed by Moscow in the Syria conflict where it supplied Russian forces in the country with naval protection. It carried over a dozen Vulkan anti-ship missiles and an array of anti-submarine and mine-torpedo weapons, the reports said. The Moskva is the second major Russian ship known to have been destroyed since the invasion began. The Slava-class cruiser was the third largest vessel in Russia's active fleet and one of its most heavily defended assets, naval expert Jonathan Bentham from the International Institute for Strategic Studies told the BBC. The cruiser was equipped with a triple-tiered air defence system that if operating properly should have made it very hard to hit. In addition to medium- and short-range defences, it could engage six short-range close-in weapon systems (CIWS) as a last resort. ""The CIWS system can fire 5,000 rounds in a minute, essentially creating a wall of flak around the cruiser, its last line of defence,"" Mr Bentham said. If the strike is proven to have come from a missile it ""raises questions over the capabilities of the modernisation of the Russian surface fleet: whether it had enough ammunition, whether it had engineering issues"". Kyiv military officials say they struck the Moskva with a Ukrainian-made Neptune missile. The cruise missile system was designed by Ukrainian military engineers in response to the growing naval threat posed by Russia in the Black Sea, following its annexation of Crimea in 2014. According to the Kyiv Post, the Ukrainian navy only received its first delivery of the 300km-range (186 miles) Neptune missiles in March last year. Since the invasion began Ukraine has received an influx of military aid from Western allies, including £100m worth of anti-aircraft and anti-tank missiles that the UK announced it would be sending last week. The Russian military has been dominant in the Black Sea since the annexation of Crimea in 2014, and has used its presence there to launch and supply the invasion. Its Black Sea fleet has supported the war with the capacity to launch cruise missiles anywhere in Ukraine, and has been important in supporting Russian attempts to seize Mariupol. ""The Moskva had been a thorn in the side of the Ukrainians since the beginning of this conflict,"" Michael Petersen, of the Russia Maritime Studies Institute, told the BBC. In the early days of Russia's invasion, the Moskva made global headlines after it ordered a group of Ukrainian soldiers on an outpost in the Black Sea to surrender. When the troops defiantly refused in a radio message, it was initially believed that the border troops had been killed. However, in fact they had been taken captive. The soldiers were eventually released as part of a prisoner swap with Russia in late March and their commander was honoured with a medal by the Ukrainian military. The tale of their bravery became such a boost to Ukraine's morale that that the country's postal service commemorated their encounter on Snake Island with a special illustrated stamp. "

Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky said Russia had now started its assault to seize Ukraine's Donbas region in the east. Mr Zelensky's remarks came after Russia said it had hit 300 targets across Ukraine, however. Up until now the picturesque Ukrainian city had escaped largely unscathed from the worst of the Russian invasion. One of the missiles there struck a garage where workers were meeting for coffee before work, officials said. ""Everyone is unsafe,"" Lviv's mayor said. Yury Buran, a 26-year-old IT worker, was one of those killed when a missile struck. ""Humans cannot do such things. They are not humans, they are barbaric invaders."" his father Anatoly said to the BBC. Read Toby Luckhurst and Mariana Maglych's full report from the site of the attack in Lviv. The final Ukrainian fighters preventing Russia from taking full control of Mariupol will not lay down their arms, the country's prime minister has said. ""They will fight until the end. And as for now, they are still in Mariupol,"" Ukrainian PM Denys Shmyhal told a US TV network. Russia's military says it controls almost all of Mariupol, while Ukraine's Azov Battalion is still holding out in Azovstal, a huge steelworks overlooking the Azov Sea. They've been camped out in a network of underground bunkers and tunnels running beneath Mariupol's massive Azovstal steel complex, ignoring multiple Russian ultimatums to surrender. Credible footage of the Moskva warship in the hours before it sank appears to show the missile cruiser listing heavily with black smoke billowing into the sky. Last week Russia blamed the loss of its Black Sea flagship on an unexplained fire, but Ukraine claimed it hit the warship with two missiles. Now the new footage has emerged, the BBC asked military experts what they thought of it. They agreed it probably showed the Moskva and that the damage was consistent with that from a missile strike, but stressed it wasn't possible to draw definitive conclusions from the grainy footage. Two British men reportedly captured by Russian forces while fighting in Ukraine have appealed on Russian state television for Boris Johnson to help free them, but its unclear whether the pleas were made under duress. Shaun Pinner, 48, and Aiden Aslin, 28, were shown in two separate videos asking to be swapped in a prisoner exchange with a pro-Kremlin politician being detained in Ukraine. Families of both men have appealed for their Russian captors to treat them humanely. After a 2,000 mile (3,128 km) journey that lasted 35 hours, the mother and severely disabled aunt of a BBC journalist have made it safely to Reading in the UK. But the journey was only possible because BBC Monitoring's Russia editor Vitaliy Shevchenko shared the story of the danger his family was facing back in Zaporizhzhia on an episode of the BBC's Ukrainecast, prompting two listeners to work together to help pull off the rescue. Listen to Vitaliy's family thanking the man who was able to aid their escape. "

612,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-61139415,2022-04-18T17:15:26,Ukraine war: Donbas tourist town braces for Russian assault," In a picturesque resort town on the northern edge of Ukraine's Donbas region, people can hear the shelling coming closer. The Russians are just five miles to the north. Sviatohirsk was once a staple of the tourist trail but now it is just another place in the Donbas where people flee the fighting. Most of its permanent residents have themselves fled, fearing the war will not stop its ruthless advance here. It was famed for its historic Russian Orthodox church and monastery, set amid the wooded Holy Mountains of the Donbas. That monastery has been damaged by shrapnel from a Russian air strike that hit a target nearby. There is now a gaping hole in the church spire. Just to the north is the city of Izyum where there is already fierce fighting. The residents who had fled Izyum told us they had been bombed day and night, been without running water and electricity for weeks. They also said there were bodies on the streets. ""Everyone is worried,"" the town's mayor, Vladimir, tells me. He says those who have remained regularly call to check he's not leaving. He is not. He is staying put and organising food parcels for the town's dwindling population. These are people who are tired, hungry and scared, too scared sometimes to apportion any blame on Russia. ""I will not talk about it,"" one woman tells me, ""because we still have to go home."" Russia is open about the fact that its renewed focus in the war will be in Ukraine's east, the Donbas. The Russian offensive here is coming from three directions - from the north, south and the east. But the landscape of the town that so charms its visitors also offers some kind of protection to its terrified residents. Unlike most of the Donbas region, which is largely flat open landscape, Sviatohirsk is set among hills and forests - providing some natural defences - making it harder for an army to manoeuvre with artillery and tanks. The residents who have stayed behind now rub shoulders with soldiers getting a brief respite from the fighting. They grab a coffee from one of the few shops left open. The military's not allowed to speak to us without permission. One man proudly tells us he was trained by British troops before the latest war started. He's confident that Ukraine can win this war. But I meet another soldier who sounds less assured. The unrelenting Russian bombardment is taking its toll. Another soldier tells us that the Russians have been targeting their positions with white phosphorous shells - which burn into the flesh. There is now a real danger that Russia may soon try to encircle Ukrainian forces in the region who have been fighting Russian-backed separatist in the region since 2014. Ukrainian troops there are among the most battle hardened in the Ukrainian Army. But they, too, are worried that their supply lines could be cut off as Russian forces push in from three different directions. The unit we saw look well trained and well equipped. Their automatic weapons were fitted with suppressors, which are silencers. An officer who agreed to be interviewed says his son, too, was trained - by US and British forces. Volodomyr told us that the Ukrainian Army is now much better prepared than the one of 2014 - when Russian backed separatists took over part of the Donbas. ""If this war had happened then, I don't know how it would end, but now we know the Russian aggressors will get what they deserve."" Volodomyr says the Russians are using similar tactics they have used elsewhere in Ukraine - ""creating panic among the local population"". He says ""it's inhuman"". It is now happening right across the Donbas. From the distance we could see and hear the city of Severodonetsk being pounded. We tried to enter but had to turn back when we heard the whistle of a shell landing nearby. It was a similar scene further south in the city of Avdiivka - where the remnants of a once bustling industrial city were now hiding in bunkers. Even a nearby village hadn't been spared. Sixty-year-old Gallina showed us the crater which had landed in her garden - blowing out the windows of her small home the night before. Inside, her granddaughter, Anastasia, was cowering under a table - still too frightened to come out. Gallina told me ""there's nothing funny about this situation"". ""We live here like cannon fodder,"" she added. Ukrainian forces are trying to slow any Russian advance - as they did in Kyiv. One soldier shows us drone footage of a bridge they recently blew up - to the north of Izyum. It brings a column of military trucks to a standstill. But more will be coming. What is happening in the Donbas now - the incessant, unrelenting shelling - is the prelude to the long expected offensive. Russia is trying to weaken Ukraine's defences and its people's resolve. There have been also Russian probing attacks across the frontline. Most have been so far repelled by Ukraine forces. But they know more will be coming. Russia is still massing and reconstituting its battered units. There are still questions as to whether Russian forces will perform any better in the east than they did outside the capital Kyiv - where they were forced to retreat. The UK's Ministry of Defence believes Russian commanders will also be concerned by the time it is taking them to subdue the port city of Mariupol - which has diverted men and materiel - slowing the Russian advance elsewhere. Ukraine still fears worse is to come. That's why President Volodymyr Zelensky has once again been calling for more weapons. Until recently Western support has been limited to ""defensive weapons"" - such as anti-tank and anti-aircraft missiles. But some countries are now sending heavier weapons. We have seen some of it - such as armoured vehicles - arrive on the frontline. The Czech Republic is providing Ukraine with a dozen T-72 tanks. The latest batch of US military aid will include 18 howitzers. But that will probably not be enough to tip to balance overwhelmingly in favour of Ukraine. Back in Sviatohirsk, Mayor Vladimir says he is still holding out hope that this conflict can be resolved through diplomacy. ""All this is terrible,"" he says. ""This destruction has no future.""

613,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-61141118,2022-04-18T16:40:25,Ukraine war: Dramatic images appear to show sinking Russian warship Moskva," Dramatic pictures - and a credible video - showing the Russian warship Moskva before it sank last week have appeared online. The video and images match the shape and design of the missile cruiser. Russia says a fire onboard caused ammunitions to explode and the vessel sank as it was being towed in a storm. Ukraine says it hit it with missiles. The new images do not immediately back the claims of either side - but there is no sign of a storm at the time. The images were allegedly taken on 14 April, a day after Ukraine claimed to have struck the warship. The three-second video clip - likely taken from a rescue boat - shows the Moskva in the distance listing heavily on her port side. A tug, likely a Russian Shakhter, is on its right. Smoke can be seen billowing out of the ship, with a section of the freeboard heavily damaged. Holes are also visible in other parts of the freeboard in one picture, suggesting the warship had taken in a substantial amount of water. It also appears all of the vessel's lifeboats had been deployed. Ukraine says it successfully struck the Moskva with two recently-introduced Ukrainian-made Neptune missiles last Wednesday. Unnamed US officials have told US media they believe the Ukrainian version. Russia alleges it was damaged after an explosion and subsequently sank because of ""stormy seas"". The BBC showed the footage to three naval experts who agreed the damage appeared consistent with a missile attack, but disagreed over whether other causes were still possible. Jonathan Bentham, of the International Institute for Strategic Studies, concluded that the vessel in the images was certainly a Slava-class cruiser and ""probably"" the Moskva. Mr Bentham said the visible damage sustained by the cruiser looked like it may have been caused by a Neptune missile attack, but stressed it was not possible to rule out other causes at this stage. ""The smoke marks on the portside seem to be near the waterline. That might indicate sea-skimming missiles, which the Neptune missiles are reported to be,"" Mr Bentham said. Another expert, Rear Admiral Chris Parry, who previously commanded a Royal Navy destroyer, told the BBC he was sure the damage was caused by a missile strike. ""You can see a very jagged imploded ship's side,"" Rear Adm Parry said. ""If it was an internal explosion, you'd see plating sticking outwards rather than inwards. But this suggests penetration and subsequent explosion. No doubt it's been hit by one or two missiles."" The former Nato commander said one explanation for the extensive smoke damage was that missiles being stored onboard became punctured in a strike and leaked their fuel the along the ship's decks, causing a devastating fire. ""You can see the decks are completely buckled, the whole ship looks like it's burnt out. I think the fuel has run along the decks, even down the back end,"" he suggested. Another military expert, Sidharth Kaushal of the Royal United Services Institute, noted to the BBC that the main area of fire damage is ""where the ammunition for the ship's anti-aircraft guns are"". ""One working hypothesis is that a fire started by the initial strike cooked off the ammunition from the anti-aircraft guns,"" Kaushal said. While conditions can vary at different times, there's nothing in the video to confirm the Kremlin's initial assertion that the Moskva sank due to stormy conditions. Prior to the sinking, Russia's defence ministry issued a statement saying ""the vessel is seriously damaged. The entire crew have been evacuated"". The BBC has not been able to verify the claims. Russia has also not admitted any casualties. On Saturday, the Russian defence ministry published footage showing what it described as the crew of the Moskva on parade in the Crimean port city of Sevastopol. The 510-crew warship had led Russia's naval assault on Ukraine, which made it an important symbolic and military target. Earlier in the conflict the Moskva gained notoriety after calling on Ukrainian border troops defending Snake Island in the Black Sea to surrender - to which they memorably radioed a message of refusal which loosely translates as ""go to hell"".

614,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-61141817,2022-04-18T16:10:13,Ukraine war: First civilian deaths in Lviv shatter sense of safety," The western Ukrainian city of Lviv, which has so far been largely unscathed by the war, has recorded its first civilian deaths after Russian strikes, officials say. At least seven people were killed and 11 injured in the early morning attack on Monday, the city's mayor said, warning that the death toll could rise as emergency services clear through the rubble. Lviv is the hub through which tens of thousands of people have fled to neighbouring Poland after withstanding weeks of strikes in cities such as Kyiv, Kharkiv and Mariupol. But Mayor Andriy Sadovyi told reporters that the morning strikes showed there were now ""no safe and unsafe locations"" in Ukraine. ""Everyone is unsafe,"" he added. Russia has said its plan is to focus its forces in the east - an attempt to capture the industrial area on the border known as the Donbas - after Ukraine held off its attempt to take the capital Kyiv, in the north. This is why the strikes in Lviv - which is hundreds of miles from the front line in the east - came as a surprise and left many residents in shock. ""When we see it in Mariupol, when we see it in Kharkiv, we see it through the prism of a great tragedy,"" Mr Sadovyi told the BBC. ""But when it happens at home people see it through the loss of the person - that you have seen and that you worked with just 30 minutes before."" Officials said the missiles struck three warehouses and a car garage, where a group of colleagues had gathered for a coffee before work. Yury Baran - who worked in IT at the garage - was among them. Later, his parents Anatoly and Maria arrived at the site of the attack which is now surrounded by ruined cars and debris. They hadn't been able to get through to their son, who was less than a month shy of his 27th birthday. Now, those helping sift through the rubble told them the worst news: he had died in the attack. ""Humans cannot do such things. They are not humans, they are barbaric invaders,"" Anatoly said of the Russians. Valya has lived in a building close to the site since she was born. The 70-year-old heard the sirens shortly before 08:00 local time (06:00 BST) but ignored them - she assumed she would be safe. The explosion knocked her to the ground. ""I was so scared,"" she told us. ""Everything was shaking, all the glass shattered."" Still wearing her pyjamas, she wandered into the street in a daze until a neighbour yelled at her to head to the basement. ""My heart was pounding,"" she said. ""I'm lucky this was just the [shockwave] and not a rocket."" Upstairs in the same block, Olena said she had taken her dog Valdo to the kitchen for cover after hearing the blast. ""The explosion was so loud I thought it hit my house,"" she said. ""I'm lucky."" Speaking to the BBC after the attacks, Mr Sadovyi said people in his city would now take air raid sirens more seriously. While the Russians have previously struck the Lviv region, and wounded five in an attack in March, these are the first civilian deaths confirmed in the city proper. ""I think after today Lviv residents will not question, should I go to the basement or not?"" he said. Tatiana was at a bus stop when the Russians struck. Like others, she couldn't believe the city was under attack - initially she thought it must have been a gas explosion. She described the attacks as ""inhuman"", saying national leaders make decisions and ordinary people ""die for nothing"". ""It scares me a lot. It's wrong,"" she said. ""This is a great sin."" The strikes shattered a sense of security in the west of the country. Sunday was the first day that the numbers crossing from Poland exceeded those leaving Ukraine since the war began, while some refugees we spoke to are now heading home after initially fleeing the east of the country. The city itself has become a haven for fleeing civilians, humanitarian groups, foreign diplomats and journalists. Officials recently extended a curfew until 23:00 local time and city centre bars and churches were bustling over the weekend. Myroslava, walking past the blast site as firefighters tackled the billowing, black smoke pouring from a roof top, told us she heard the explosion from 1.5km away and echoed the thoughts of all those caught up in Russia's invasion. ""We're anxious, we're empty inside - why us?"" she said, wide eyed and raising her hands in despair. ""We don't understand what it's all for."" Additional reporting by Dan Johnson and Mohamed Madi "
615,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-61139735,2022-04-18T15:50:26,Ukraine war: Captured Britons appeal for UK help on Russian state TV," Two British men reportedly captured by Russian forces while fighting in Ukraine have appeared on Russian state TV appealing to Boris Johnson for help. Shaun Pinner, 48, and Aiden Aslin, 28, were shown in two separate videos on Monday, asking to be exchanged with a pro-Russian politician held in Ukraine. It is not clear if their pleas to the prime minister, shown on the Rossiya 24 channel, were made under duress. The Foreign Office called on the Kremlin to treat prisoners humanely. A source from the department condemned ""the exploitation of prisoners of war for political purposes"". In the two clips, Mr Aslin and Mr Pinner address the prime minister, asking to be exchanged for pro-Kremlin politician Viktor Medvedchuk. In his video, Mr Aslin speaks while an unidentified man stands over him. Mr Medvedchuk has also appeared in a video, released by Ukraine's intelligence service. Both Britons had been living in Ukraine before it was invaded and have Ukrainian partners. They had both been serving as marines in Ukraine's military. In an earlier social media video Mr Pinner, who is originally from Bedfordshire, gives his name and says he was fighting in the besieged port city of Mariupol before being captured. He says he is now in the breakaway Donetsk People's Republic area in eastern Ukraine. Again, it is not clear if he was speaking under duress. The family of Mr Pinner say he is a ""funny, much-loved, well-intentioned"" man. They said they are hoping for a quick resolution to his situation. They called for him and Mr Aslin to be treated in accordance with the Geneva Convention. The convention includes treating them humanely and prohibiting humiliating and degrading treatment. In a statement, Mr Pinner's family said he was a ""well-respected"" soldier in the British Army before he moved to Ukraine four years ago to use his previous experience and training with the Ukrainian military. He is a ""proud member of his unit"" in the Ukrainian Marines, they said. ""Shaun enjoyed the Ukrainian way of life and considered Ukraine as his adopted country over the last four years. During this time, he met his Ukrainian wife who is very focussed on the humanitarian needs of the country,"" they said. Mr Pinner's three-year contract was due to expire at the end of the year and he was planning to enter a humanitarian role in the country, according to his family. ""Shaun is a funny, much-loved, well-intentioned husband, son, father, brother and friend to many,"" they said. ""We are hoping for a quick resolution to allow Shaun and Aiden to return safely to their families and we ask for privacy at this difficult time. ""Our hearts go out to all those caught up in this horrific conflict."" A Foreign Office source said it was aware of the detention of two British nationals and had been in touch with their families to support them, adding that it was advising against all travel to Ukraine. Former care worker Mr Aslin, who has a Ukrainian fiancée and dual citizenship, is also believed to have been captured in Mariupol. Fighting has continued in the city despite an ultimatum from Moscow for the remaining fighters to give up. Ukraine's Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said the defenders would fight to the end against Russian forces. Mariupol is seen as a major strategic prize for Russia as it would gain control of a vast swathe of southern and eastern Ukraine. The situation for civilians in the city is desperate, with homes destroyed and widespread water shortages. "

The port city has not fallen despite an ultimatum from Moscow to remaining fighters to give up, he said. Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said Russia has chosen to raze Mariupol to the ground. Local officials said Russian forces have announced they will stop anyone from entering or leaving the city. Capturing the whole of the city is seen as a major strategic prize for Russia, leaving it in control of a vast swathe of southern and eastern Ukraine. An advisor to the mayor of Mariupol said residents would be forced to queue for a pass to enable them to move between districts and some could have their phones confiscated or be taken against their will to Russia. Petro Andryushchenko also said Russia was holding at least 20,000 Ukrainian citizens in filtration camps outside Mariupol. In an interview with the US network ABC, Mr Shmyhal said a Russian deadline for Ukrainian forces in Mariupol to surrender by Sunday had been ignored. ""The city still has not fallen,"" he said. ""There is still our military forces, our soldiers, so they will fight until the end. And as for now, they still are in Mariupol."" Russia's military says it controls almost all of Mariupol, while Ukraine's Azov Battalion is still holding out in Azovstal, a huge steelworks overlooking the Azov Sea. Justin Crump, a military expert at security consultancy Sybilline, told the BBC there could be 500 to 800 Ukrainian troops holding out in the city. ""[The steelworks] has nuclear bunkers, tunnels, it's built to survive a nuclear conflict - they are really well set for defence,"" he said. ""They have had more than 50 days to fortify it and build escape routes,"" Mr Crump added. ""I suspect that unless they are wiped out they'll be there a long time. It's credible there would be guerrilla resistance."" Ukraine has demanded that Russian forces open humanitarian corridors from Mariupol to allow civilians and wounded Ukrainian troops to leave, but no large-scale evacuations have taken place for several weeks. Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk confirmed there would be no corridor again on Monday and repeated calls for a way out of Mariupol to be set up. ""We demand an urgent humanitarian corridor from the territory of the Azovstal plant for women, children and other civilians,"" she said in a post on Telegram. The situation for civilians in the city is desperate, with homes destroyed and widespread water shortages. The family of one of two British men reportedly been captured by Russian forces while fighting in Mariupol have said they are hoping for a quick resolution to his situation. Shaun Pinner, 48, who is serving in the Ukrainian Army, has appeared on Russian state television, as has Aiden Aslin. They asked to be exchanged for Viktor Medvedchuk, a pro-Russian Ukrainian politician being held by Ukraine's authorities, though it was unclear if they were speaking under duress. Mr Medvedchuk's wife has also called for the exchange, appealing to UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson to help arrange it. As Mariupol defenders continue to hold out, Ukrainian officials still deny any possibility of territorial concessions to Russia. In an interview broadcast on Sunday by CNN, President Volodymyr Zelensky brushed aside the idea of letting Moscow take over parts of eastern Ukraine to stop the conflict. ""Ukraine and its people are clear. We have no claim to anyone else's territories but we are not going to give up ours,"" he said. Meanwhile, authorities in the western city of Lviv said seven people were killed in rocket strikes on Monday morning. It is not yet clear what the strikes were targeting. In recent weeks, Russia has focused its offensive on eastern Ukraine. "

""If we are told to stop we will stop, unless we are told otherwise, we will continue,"" Sir Tim Clarke told the BBC. Most major international airlines pulled out of Russia amid sweeping sanctions imposed by Western countries since the war began in Ukraine. But Emirates is one of the few carriers that is still operating flights to Moscow and St Petersburg. When asked if the airline would reconsider its position, Emirates president Sir Tim said that ""it was not his call"" but a decision that the United Arab Emirates (UAE) government would take. As well as carrying passengers, the airline also transports cargo including humanitarian goods, food and medical supplies, which are not on the sanctions list. Sir Tim added that it was important to recognise the Russian population may not be part of the war in Ukraine. And that the diplomatic core of other countries, who have missions in Moscow need to be able to function by moving in and out of the country. He said: ""We are catering to people who are on the periphery of the main issue here, and that is probably the way the [UAE] government looks at it."" The United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia have rejected calls from western governments to impose sanctions on Russia. Abu Dhabi has also not severed economic ties with Moscow. It was one of only three countries, along with China and India, to abstain in a United Nations Security Council vote in February to condemn Russia's invasion of Ukraine. It also abstained in a General Assembly vote on 7 April to suspend Russia from the UN Human Rights Council. Since the outbreak of the war, Moscow has faced a barrage of unprecedented sanctions, including bans on Russian aircraft using airspace and airports in the US, the EU, the UK and Canada. International flights by Russian airlines have been severely curtailed due to the sanctions. National carrier Aeroflot has suspended all international flights, except for its service to the Belarus capital Minsk, due to the sanctions. Sir Tim believes that the war in Ukraine could spell long term implications for the global airline industry, especially if Russia is excluded by the West from the global economy. ""This [war] will have major manifestations of perhaps disadvantage for both sides. And this will have an impact on the industry,"" he said. Sir Tim said Emirates was seeing strong demand despite high oil prices. The airline has passed on the cost to consumers by adding a fuel surcharge to airfares but that hasn't impacted bookings. ""Irrespective of that, people are ready to pay the prices that we have to charge to cover this enormous increase in the fuel price,"" Sir Tim said. He added that the airline industry was used to dealing with high oil prices but said he felt that budget carriers would find it difficult get through this without taking a financial hit. Brent, one of the main benchmarks for oil, has been trading above $100 for nearly two months since the Russia-Ukraine war triggered volatility in global energy markets. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) has warned that the airline industry's overall financial performance in 2022 is likely to worsen due to the challenge of higher oil prices. Jet fuel makes up about a quarter of an airline's costs. Despite the recent setbacks, Sir Tim said that Emirates had returned to profitability over the last six months due to ""roaring"" demand. The carrier expects to report improved annual earnings this year after it posted a loss of $5.5bn in the 2020-2021 fiscal year as the Covid-19 pandemic ravaged the global aviation industry. The Dubai government injected $3.1bn into Emirates to bail out the state-owned airline, which was forced to ground flights and lay-off thousands of employees after the outbreak of the pandemic. Sir Tim said the airline was now looking to hire 3,000 to 4,000 cabin crew and additional pilots on the back of booming travel demand. ""If we can have all our aircraft flying today, 270 of them then we would. I can't because I am just short of crew,"" he said. "

Steve Dury is hosting a family-of-five from Kharkiv and said they had celebrated Easter with traditional cakes, a barbecue and bike rides. Mr Dury, from Langport, Somerset, added that three-year-old Egor has already made a friend in the family dog, Maya. ""He's got a great sense of humour, he loves to laugh,"" said Mr Dury. The local government officer collected the family from Bristol Airport on Tuesday after they were kept waiting for a month for Egor's visa to be processed. He is also hosting Liudmyla Tarasenko and her 15-year-old daughter Daria, Liudmyla's 27-year-old niece and Egor's mother, Yulia Svichkar, as well as 13-year-old Denys. They have been ""keen to cook Ukrainian dishes"" and show their culture through family recipes, said Mr Dury. ""It's really, really nice to be exposed to Ukrainian culture, Ukrainian food and have interesting conversations with them. ""They have a traditional family recipe that's been passed down by their grandparents. Liudmyla has promised to make this lovely cake as an Easter treat for us all. ""They're happy to be able to join in and do something to mark it,"" said Mr Dury. The community welcomed the family to the area with a barbecue on Saturday to give refugees staying in the area a chance to meet and speak Ukrainian. Their Easter plans also include a bicycle ride in the countryside after a local shop offered free hire of bicycles for the day. Mr Dury thanked the bike shop and others in the area for their generosity as the family settle into his home. Follow BBC West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

But even by German standards, the soul-searching over Berlin's Russia policy is remarkable. Since Russia invaded Ukraine on 24 February, many German politicians have publicly admitted they got Vladimir Putin wrong. Even German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier has apologised, saying it was a mistake to use trade and energy to build bridges with Moscow. ""It's a bitter acknowledgement that for 30 years we emphasised dialogue and co-operation with Russia,"" says Nils Schmid, foreign affairs spokesperson for Mr Steinmeier's party, the centre-left Social Democrats (SPD). ""Now we have to recognise this has not worked. That's why we have entered a new era for European security."" That new era was dubbed ""Zeitenwende"" - literally meaning a turning point - by Germany's SPD Chancellor Olaf Scholz in a now-famous speech in the German parliament a few days after the invasion. It means scrapping rules about weapons exports, a huge boost in defence spending and an end to Russian energy imports. A Russian gas pipeline to Germany called Nord Stream 2 has already been suspended. ""For the foreseeable future, co-operation with Russia will not occur. It will be more about containment and deterrence and, if needed, defence against Russia,"" Mr Schmid tells me. Unexpectedly hawkish words for a party that until seven weeks ago believed Germany's historical guilt and moral duty to make up for Nazi crimes meant peace with Russia at all costs. But in Berlin, the war in Ukraine feels very close. The images of shelled Ukrainian buildings look like German cities in World War Two. And the third-of-a-million refugees, mostly women and children, arriving at German train stations remind many here of their parents or grandparents as children fleeing Russian soldiers in 1945. Even Germany's view of its own history is changing. Until the invasion mainstream opinion was that German reunification was thanks to dialogue with Moscow by another SPD chancellor, Willy Brandt. But now the debate has shifted, with reminders that Mr Brandt's diplomacy was backed up by strong deterrence, including a West German defence budget of 3% of GDP. The issue of German historical war guilt has also become more nuanced. Before the invasion the government argued against weapon deliveries to Ukraine because of Nazi crimes against Russia. ""Under Putin, official Russian policy tried to monopolise the memory of the Second World War for the bilateral German-Russian relationship,"" explains Mr Schmid. This blinded parts of German society to the suffering of Ukrainians during the war, he adds. Now there is a greater awareness of Ukraine's traumas under the Nazis. Berlin's rhetoric has shifted dramatically. But some ask whether actions are following fast enough. Certainly warm words of support are not enough for Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky. He has criticised Germany's continued reliance on Russian oil and gas. In a BBC interview last week, Mr Zelensky called payments for Russian energy ""blood money"". And a planned visit to Kyiv by President Steinmeier was cancelled at the last minute. There are conflicting reports about what happened: some Ukrainian officials say Mr Steinmeier was not ""disinvited"". But certainly German politicians and commentators interpret the failed visit as a sign of Ukraine's distrust in the German president, who as foreign minister under Angela Merkel spent years trying to achieve peace by engaging with Russia. At the Brandenburg Gate - a symbol of another ""Wende"", the word used in German for the process of German reunification - I meet Claudia Major, defence specialist at SWP, the German Institute for International and Security Affairs. ""Our partners look at us, and say: OK, you do a Zeitenwende but what are you practically doing?"" she says. ""On sanctions we are timid and on weapons delivery, we are reluctant. So, rightly, they wonder what that Zeitenwende is about, and given that Germany is a big economic, military, political power in the middle of Europe, whatever we do makes a difference, in good ways and bad."" Germany has committed to sanctioning Russian energy imports, but wants a gradual phase-out, rather than an instant embargo. The government argues this would tip Germany into recession and cost hundreds of thousands of jobs. ""This is a dilemma that Germany has created itself,"" argues political scientist Liana Fix from the Körber Foundation. ""That's obviously difficult to accept for other countries, who are willing to go ahead with an embargo and have done their homework on energy diversification."" Ironically, it's a Green Party politician, Economy Minister Robert Habeck, from a party that for years has been calling for energy independence from Russia, who is having to solve this dilemma. On military support for Ukraine, Berlin says it is prepared to send whatever weapons Kyiv needs. But there are allegations that some ministries are getting tied up in bureaucracy. Here, too, it is a Green politician, Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock, who is pushing the governing coalition to go faster. She has called for heavy weaponry, such as tanks or fighter jets, for Ukraine. The chancellor, meanwhile, appears to dodge the question when asked - possibly nervous of losing his party's support. Olaf Scholz has to keep his party onside, govern in a three-way coalition and overturn Germany's guilt-laden pacifist identity overnight. But even his allies say the chancellor should at least communicate better what's going on. One speech in parliament and a few TV chat shows are not enough, says Claudia Major. Meanwhile, it feels like many individual Germans are going through their own Zeitenwende. Ariane Bemmer, a columnist for the Tagesspiegel newspaper, has written about reassessing her own feelings towards Russia. ""I definitely got it wrong, it's like losing a friend,"" she tells me. Like many in the former West Germany in the 1980s, she was wary of US-style cutthroat capitalism. She bought a book called Ami Go Home - she never read it, but felt it would look good on her bookshelf - and was intrigued by the reforms in Russia. ""In America you had Ronald Reagan as a president, which was a shock for us. We thought: what will he do, this crazy actor with his cowboy boots? Will he set the world on fire? Russia was a place where all the good changes were, perestroika, freedom, wind of change,"" she says. Few in Germany think that now. In one recent poll, 55% of Germans said Berlin should send heavy weapons, such as tanks and fighter jets, to Ukraine to fight against Russia. For Ariane, and many other Germans, any lingering Russophile romanticism vanished for good the day Putin's tanks rolled over Ukraine's border. "

Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said in an interview with ABC that Ukrainian forces still in the city would ""fight to the end"". Troops of the Azov Battalion are still holed up in the massive Azovstal steel complex, but Russia has offered safe passage to those who surrender. Capturing the whole of the city is seen as a major strategic prize for Russia, leaving it in control of a vast swathe of southern and eastern Ukraine. Meanwhile in Kharkiv, bombardments continue, with at least five people killed and 13 injured. Fires are said to be raging throughout the city. The BBC's Joe Inwood in Dnipro says air raid sirens across eastern Ukraine have gone from sporadic to near constant. As many population centres in eastern Ukraine come under fire, what about the residents who have been left behind as most people leave? The small village of Serhiivka was completely quiet on Sunday - hardly a person on the streets or milling around the centre of the village, where you would normally find life. There used to be 1,500 people here, but today there are only about 300 residents left, and more are leaving as Russia renews its campaign. ""I have lived here all my life, I'm not going anywhere,"" said Mykola Luhynets, a 59-year-old carrying a rifle and wearing the armband of the territorial defence. Luhynets signed up and took a gun in February. ""I will stay in Serhiivka and defend it if necessary,"" he said.

A huge queue of lorries has formed at Poland's eastern border with Belarus as Russian and Belarusian drivers try to leave the EU. Lorries from the two countries carrying any goods except for medicine, mail or petroleum products are banned from the bloc as of midnight on Saturday (22:00 GMT). The move is part of sanctions over Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Polish border and customs officials are continuing to process the lorries waiting to leave despite the passing of the deadline. When the queue was at its longest on Saturday evening, waiting times were about 28 hours.

626,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-61135091,2022-04-17T17:29:53,Older residents of the east reluctant to hit the road," The small village of Serhiivka, in eastern Ukraine, was completely quiet on Sunday - hardly a person on the streets or milling around the centre of the village, where you would normally find life. There used to be 1,500 people here, before the full-scale invasion of Russian troops into Ukraine in February, and the renewed violence around the frontlines not far from here. Today there are only about 300 residents left, and more are leaving as Russia renews its campaign to the east and south. The population would have already skewed older, but few of the younger people who were here have stayed. It's a phenomenon seen in villages and towns around Ukraine, as younger generations have moved to safer areas while their parents and grandparents choose to stick it out. ""I have lived here all my life, I'm not going anywhere,"" said Mykola Luhynets, a 59-year-old carrying a rifle and wearing the armband of the territorial defence. Luhynets signed up and took a gun in February. ""I will stay in Serhiivka and defend it if necessary,"" he said. In normal times, Serhiivka is an industrial and agricultural village - many of its working-age population are either farmers or staff at the local coal enrichment factory. It could be in the line of fire if the Russian forces decided to encroach beyond Donetsk towards the city of Dnipro. ""We only have simple shelters here but we have prepared them,"" said Valeriy Duhelnyy, 59, the head of the village and local territorial defence units. Duhelnyy is the equivalent of the village mayor, a position he has held since 2020. ""It's hard for older people here to hit the road,"" he said. ""And maybe some are sentimental - they have stronger emotional ties to where they live. They don't want to die anywhere but home."" More than two million older people in the east of the country are at extreme risk as a result of the Russian assault, according to the charity HelpAge International. There is particular concern among charities focused on supporting the elderly that older people have been unable to move out of harm's way, or feel unable to take on the hardship of upheaval. Some simply do not have the money to move, or a place to go. ""I'm a retiree and I don't have much, only a small pension,"" said Rayisa Horislavets, 66, who lives with her daughter in a small house in Serhiivka. ""I can't afford to rent an apartment somewhere safer. I can't rule out that something bad will happen here, but I just have no other options,"" she said. ""Nobody needs me anywhere else, so I decided come-what-may I would stay here."" Horislavets used to speak regularly to her sister, who lives on the other side of the frontline that separates the territory still in Ukrainian control from the ""Donetsk People's Republic"" - the breakaway region where Russia has forged a separatist movement since 2014. The phone connection to her sister died about two weeks ago, Horislavets said. But the relationship had already deteriorated, after her sister began telling her that she thought the news about Russia's attacks on Ukraine was fake. ""She told me not to believe anything I see in our media, that it is the Ukrainians doing all the damage,"" Horislavets said. ""I told her there are witnesses, we see what is happening in Kharkiv and elsewhere, but she doesn't believe me."" Her story is not uncommon in eastern Ukraine, where frontlines have divided families and Russian propaganda has convinced many on the Russian side that the atrocities and attacks reported in international media are fake - that Ukraine is the aggressor. So far, Serhiivka has been peaceful. The remaining residents hope it will stay that way, though they are preparing the best they can for worse. They have seen the destruction of Kharkiv to the north and Mariupol to the south, and the grinding war not far from their doorstep in Donetsk. Horislavets said that when that conflict began, she had taken care for her sister, who lived there. ""When bad things came to their home we supported them,"" she said. ""Now bad things come to our home, and they do not support us."" She would like to speak to her sister again. ""Of course, she is my sister,"" she said. But not right now. ""We would only fight.""

In the run-up to the Saturday deadline, the line extended to 80km (50 miles), with some stuck for up to 33 hours. The EU has banned lorries from Russia and Belarus - except those carrying medicine, mail or petroleum products - from entering or staying in the bloc. The move is part of sanctions over Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Drone footage filed by Reuters news agency showed long queues remaining as the midnight deadline neared. ""There are still many kilometres to drive... so it's unrealistic,"" it quoted a Belarusian driver on his chances of crossing the border in time. And hours after the deadline passed, the waiting times had been shortened to 12 hours, says the BBC's Adam Easton in Warsaw, with the number of trucks at two border crossings between 230-400 vehicles. However, it is unclear what will happen to thousands of other trucks from the two countries estimated to currently be on EU territory. One possibility is that they will be seized by national authorities. A Polish official representing transport groups expressed concern that such a move may lead to similar measures against Polish trucks using Russia and Belarus on their way back home. The EU - and many other Western countries - have imposed punishing sanctions against Russia, and its main ally Belarus. The two countries have reciprocated with measures of their own. "

He said Jesus' ""message of hope, the triumph of life over death, and good over evil"" would especially resonate with Christians in Ukraine this year. Addressing Ukrainians in their language, he urged them to ""be strong"" and to ""have courage in your heart"". Prince Charles also highlighted the suffering of ""innocent victims of conflict"" in his Easter message. In a video message shared on his Twitter account, the prime minister said Easter was a time when the UK ""burst with new life and new hope"". He said it was also a moment to reflect on the meaning of Christ's ""self-sacrifice and resurrection"" for people today as he paid tribute to Christians in the UK ""loving their neighbours and carrying out countless acts of kindness"". Remembering those ""around the world facing fear of persecution"", Mr Johnson said for the Christians of Ukraine - whether they were marking Easter today or its Orthodox equivalent later this month - Christ's message of hope would ""resonate this year perhaps more than any other"". ""Easter tells us that there is light beyond the darkness, that beyond the suffering lies redemption,"" he added. Addressing the Christians of Ukraine in their language, Mr Johnson rounded off his message by saying: ""Be strong and have courage in your heart all you who trust in the Lord."" The prime minister's address comes a day after he and other senior ministers were banned from entering Russia over the UK's ""hostile"" stance on the war in Ukraine. Meanwhile in his Easter message, the Prince of Wales said he was ""heartbroken"" at the plight of those forced to flee their homes due to conflict or persecution but was ""profoundly moved"" by those ready to open their homes to people in need. Russia's invasion of Ukraine has led to millions of people fleeing their homes. In the UK, more than 200,000 people have expressed an interest in housing Ukrainian refugees through the government's Homes for Ukraine sponsorship scheme - although it has been criticised for being too bureaucratic and slow. Prince Charles said: ""Today, millions of people find themselves displaced, wearied by their journey from troubled places, wounded by the past, fearful of the future - and in need of a welcome, of rest, and of kindness. He added that it had been ""profoundly moving to see how so many people are ready to open their homes to those in need, and how they have offered their time and their resources to help those facing such soul-destroying sorrow and hardship."" The prince doesn't refer to Ukraine by name in his Easter message but there can be no doubt that the unfolding horrors there have inspired him to highlight the plight of refugees. He has often in the past spoken out in support of Christians who've been persecuted in different parts of the world. He's also in recent weeks shown his support for Ukraine by visiting the Ukrainian Catholic Cathedral in London where he lit a candle and expressed his sympathy with members of the Ukrainian community. His Easter message recalls the actions of Jesus at the Last Supper when he knelt before his disciples and washed their ""travel-weary feet"". The principle of looking after and serving one another is particularly relevant, the prince suggests, in the context of millions of people who find themselves displaced and ""wearied by their journey from troubled places"". At Easter, he says, we are reminded of the timeless example of goodness in the face of light and of courage in the face of fear. Prince Charles continued that he ""prayed with all my heart"" the ""darkness of the world"" would be dispelled. ""This Easter, as always, we are reminded of Our Lord's timeless example of goodness in the face of suffering, of courage in the face of fear, of faith in the face of despair,"" he added. ""His light triumphed in that dark time."" Prince Charles also remembered the role his father, the Duke of Edinburgh, played during the many Maundy services he attended. He said it was an ""enormous privilege"" to perform the ceremony of distributing Maundy money to the community when he stepped in for the Queen on Thursday. The prince has previously used his annual Easter message to highlight social issues, including knife crime and religious tolerance. "

Shelly Wall, from Cumbria, said she offered her home after she encountered ""the kindness of strangers"" who once came to the aid of her own family. Mrs Wall found mum-of-two Mariya, from Lviv, on a website connecting families in the UK and Ukraine. ""I feel nice that I can see my children safe and happy,"" said Mariya. Her family are thought to be one of the first to be rehomed in Cumbria as part of the government's Homes for Ukraine programme. Mrs Wall and her family appeared on the BBC programme DIY SOS, when their home near Wigton was transformed to help son Noah, now aged 10, who was born with serious medical problems. ""The kindness of others and the community that we live in was unbelievable,"" she told BBC Radio Cumbria's John Bowness. Mariya recalled the moment she received the first call from Mrs Wall. ""I was on the sofa with my husband, we were talking, when I heard the telephone ring and I saw it was not an Ukrainian number,"" she said. ""I remember this nice voice, so calming."" While Lviv has largely escaped bombardment, Mariya said her family faced a bigger risk because of where they lived. ""We just started to think about how to leave, how to survive, what to do, because of the children,"" she said. The family faced visa delays, with Mariya receiving hers before her 11-year-old daughter and six-year-old son. Her husband has to remain in Ukraine. The families met for the first time on 8 April when they arrived at Manchester Airport, where they were greeted with a Ukrainian flag. ""We just started to hug each other - it was so emotional - it was like we knew each other for a long, long time, not just a few weeks,"" said Mariya. ""I feel nice that I can see my children safe and happy here in this beautiful home."" Follow BBC North East & Cumbria on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.

631,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-61011855,2022-04-17T06:18:49,Ukraine: Online posts 'transform' war crimes documentation," Images posted online will be crucial in prosecuting war crimes in Ukraine, according to UK legal experts. A law professor said the use of bomb footage from Yemen during a mock war crimes trial showed how images shared online had ""transformed"" the documentation of atrocities. One online investigator said there was ""so much"" useful and verifiable information in warzone footage. But experts also said eyewitness accounts must not be overshadowed. Cases against individuals who have committed war crimes in Ukraine could depend on social media posts about unlawful killings, wartime sexual violence and torture, said Prof Yvonne McDermott Rees, who runs the Open Source Research for Human Rights project at Swansea University. She said material, known as open-source information, had ""completely transformed our way of knowing about human rights violations"". ""We're seeing increasingly the UN commissions of inquiry, fact-finding missions, even the International Criminal Court in the Hague, using this kind of evidence,"" she explained. Prof McDermott Rees said open-source information had also been used in Swedish and Dutch courts to prosecute members of the so-called Islamic State returning from Syria. Open-source information is information that is freely available online. ""A video of a beheading that's recorded or shared on YouTube or Facebook... is evidence,"" she said, adding that similar material was recently tested for use in a UK court. In 2018, unverified footage of the aftermath of a deadly airstrike on the office of the presidency in Sana'a, the capital of Yemen, was posted on Twitter. The open-source investigative website, Bellingcat, used geolocation, satellite imagery and comparisons of hundreds of images to document the attack. Their evidence was then presented in the mock trial of a fictitious Saudi pilot accused of war crimes. ""We wanted to see if one of these videos would be accepted as evidence in a common-law court in England and Wales,"" said Nick Waters, the justice accountability lead at Bellingcat. He said the result was a methodology ""we're now using to collect and verify incidents in Ukraine"". The problem, said Prof McDermott Rees, is that in the midst of war, bystanders are rarely thinking about a criminal trial. ""They're sharing it with the intention of showing the world what they've witnessed,"" she explained. Bystanders are being encouraged to film landmarks and known buildings in their footage of war crimes and to use a mobile phone app developed by the International Bar Association, called eyeWitness. ""It does things like capturing the metadata, the time, the date, the place where this piece of content was recorded,"" she said. ""If you are recording this, as well as showing the injuries suffered, the weapon, see if you can include landmarks or buildings in the background."" She said Witness, a charity that uses videos to document human rights abuses, has published guidelines on how bystanders can gather images that will be acceptable for use in courts. War crimes investigators are also fighting against the widely held view that online images cannot be trusted. ""That misses out on the fact that there is so much useful and verifiable information being posted on the Internet,"" Mr Waters said, adding that it is difficult to fake incidents online because real events come with a pattern of tweets from multiple sources. ""With the advent of social media, of smartphones, you effectively have an incredibly powerful information network where people are able to take pictures and take videos of the events,"" Mr Waters added. Solicitor Dearbhla Minogue works with the human rights charity, Global Legal Action Network and Bellingcat, She said viewing a video of something happening is a lot more compelling than hearing somebody talk about it. ""Think about... the death of George Floyd,"" said Ms Minogue. ""People actually saw that happening in real-time, including the jury, by watching what was filmed by a passer-by. ""That impacted the outcome of that trial because it was no longer one person's word against another person's."" The University of California has developed rules for the use of digital open-source material, called the Berkeley Protocol. The question facing war crimes prosecutors, Ms Minogue said, is how to reassure a judge that the video is not faked or manipulated for political reasons. ""With a video that just appears online purporting to be the aftermath of an airstrike, how do we know that it is what it says it is?"" she said. ""That it's not staged or faked or these issues that are being raised by Russia in the context of these Bucha videos."" Ms Minogue said the normal way in domestic courts is to call the person who filmed it to give evidence in court. ""But in the cast of open-source information, where you don't have the creator, you can't ask them how they created it, whether they manipulated it [or] whether someone else could manipulate it. ""Using the information in the video and comparing it with other satellite imagery or other videos showing the same event, they can piece together all these bits of content and assess whether they think it real or fake."" Prof McDermott Rees warned that while open-source material can help, ""it's important not to lose the human side in all of this"". She said: ""In Yemen, this kind of evidence wasn't seen on its own, it was in close collaboration with accounts that were gathered by NGOs on the ground."" In Ukraine, she said evidence of rape had been documented in the testimony of survivors, ""so it's really important that we don't underplay the importance of those human accounts"". ""It's about showing that when international crimes are committed, they're not committed with impunity,"" Prof McDermott Rees said. ""So this work in documenting and gathering information… we have to make sure that's going to stand up in court and that we'll see justice. ""All of us are seeing this really disturbing content coming out of Bucha, other areas in Ukraine and I think universally we want to see justice done."" "

The Bishop of St Edmundsbury and Ipswich, the Right Reverend Martin Seeley, said he still had no idea when a family might arrive at his home. As of 7 April, only 1,200 refugees had arrived in the UK via the visa scheme. Bishop Seeley called for changes to speed up the process. More than 4.7 million people have fled Ukraine because of the Russian invasion, according to the UN. Government figures last week showed that 12,500 sponsorship visas had been issued from 43,600 applications, but only a fraction of those issued with their visas had arrived in this country. ""The frustration is that the government's approach to this continues to be quite protracted,"" said Bishop Seeley. ""Certainly people are getting hooked up to hosts, refugees are getting brought to this country, but the process is slow and the numbers are quite low in proportion to the number of people that have actually applied for visas. ""Ukrainians have been able to enter other countries, such as Poland and Germany much more easily because there isn't the visa requirement."" Bishop Seeley acknowledged the Home Secretary's apology last week over delays to the sponsorship scheme, but said: ""Actually lifting some of the requirements would make it a bit easier. ""What I would hope is to see the apology followed up by a change in the regulations and requirements. ""I am just struck that at a point of catastrophic crisis we still insist on a whole number of hoops to jump through when other countries in Europe have seen fit to set those aside."" Offering to host a family in their home was ""in one sense... an instinctive decision"", he said. ""It goes back to love. You support people in desperate need because you love them and you want to show that love, and that love endures, and you sustain that because of that conviction,"" he added. ""I think the good thing that's happening here in Ipswich - and I know is happening across Suffolk - is that people are organising not just places for people to stay, but teams of people to provide that ongoing support."" Meanwhile his family, who have previously supported a Syrian refugee in 2016, are still waiting to open their home to a Ukrainian family. A Home Office spokesperson said: ""We are continuing to speed up visa processing across both schemes [Ukraine Family Scheme and Homes for Ukraine], including boosting caseworkers and simplifying the forms and we expect thousands more to come through these uncapped routes.""

As the BBC's Anna Foster reports, most people are yet to return, and there's just one small, hardy group who are trying to pave the way for others to come back. Sergei and his wife arrived at their flat five days ago. Now they and their neighbours are trying to rebuild their damaged homes, and clearing away the debris of countless Russian shells. ""You always want to come back home"", he says. ""So we used our first chance to return as well. And we used our chance to make sure that all the property is safe, even from locals that might come and steal something."" But making these towns safe again will be a huge job. Read the full story here. Fresh air strikes hit the Ukrainian capital Kyiv on Saturday. One person was killed and several wounded in Kyiv, according to Mayor Vitali Klitschko. Air defences were trying to protect people, Mr Klitschko said on his Telegram channel, ""but the enemy is ruthless"". ""You forget sometimes that you're still afraid of every sound, even if it comes from your neighbour's house, or if someone bangs a car door... No words can describe how scary it is,"" local resident Anna Budko told the BBC. The Russian defence ministry said it was targeting a military factory in the capital. Explosions were also reported in the western city of Lviv. Officials said air defences destroyed four Russian cruise missiles. Russia has banned UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson and other senior ministers from entering Russia over what it described as their ""hostile"" attitude towards the war in Ukraine. The others mentioned in the ban include Foreign Secretary Liz Truss, Defence Secretary Ben Wallace, Chancellor Rishi Sunak and Home Secretary Priti Patel. Moscow said the decision was taken in response to sanctions imposed by the UK since the invasion. ""London's unbridled information and political campaign aimed at isolating Russia internationally, creating conditions for containing our country and strangling the domestic economy"" had prompted its decision, it added. The UK government said it remained resolute in its support for Ukraine. US President Joe Biden has been subject to a similar ban since March.

A large group of sailors is seen on parade in the Crimean port city of Sevastopol, met by Navy Commander-in-Chief Adm Nikolay Yevmenov. The Moskva was the flagship of the Black Sea Fleet. The ship's demise has been described as a huge blow to Russian morale. The ministry announced late on Thursday that the Moskva had sunk on stormy seas after a fire caused by exploding ammunition. Ukraine said it had sunk the ship with two Neptune missiles. Russia said at the time that the crew had been taken to Sevastopol, a major port Crimea, which Russia annexed from Ukraine in 2014. This, however, is the first time any evidence has been offered of the survival of any sailors. The video shows Adm Yevmenov and two other officers standing on a parade ground in front of about 100 sailors. It is not clear when the meeting took place. In an interview shown at the end of the video, Adm Yevmenov says that the officers and crew are currently residing at their base in Sevastopol and will continue their service in the navy. Russia has not reported any casualties from the fire or the sinking. However, an unnamed US official quoted by Reuters news agency said Washington believed there were casualties. Ukraine says the ship's captain, Anton Kuprin, was killed on board, but the BBC has been unable to verify this. The 12,490-tonne cruiser is the biggest Russian warship to be sunk in action since World War Two. On the first day of Russia's invasion of Ukraine on 24 February, the Moskva gained notoriety after calling on a small garrison of Ukrainian border troops defending Snake Island in the Black Sea to surrender - to which they memorably radioed an expletive-laden message of refusal. Originally built in the Soviet era, the Moskva entered service in the early 1980s. The vessel was actually built in Ukraine's southern city of Mykolaiv, which has been heavily bombed by Russia in recent days. The guided missile cruiser was previously deployed by Moscow in the Syria conflict where it supplied Russian forces in the country with naval protection from the Mediterranean. It is the second major vessel Russia has lost since the start of its invasion of Ukraine. "

Pastor Valentine Pavlenkov is part of a group of Ukrainian families that fled the conflict and their village near the city of Kharkiv. Known as Ukraine's second city, it has been a target of Russian attacks. The group of 13 flew into Belfast International Airport on Saturday with the help of a County Antrim church. Church representatives from Ballymoney Free Presbyterian church met the travellers at the airport. ""We are so grateful to be here and it's important we are here,"" said Pastor Pavlenkov. ""It's really precious and important to us that they contacted us and invited us here."" The pastor and Mrs Pavlenkov came with their four children and other members of his congregation. ""Thank you very much - we are touched, happy to be here and have no words to express our thanks,"" he told BBC News NI, through a translator. Donald Fleming, from Faith in Action Ministries, told BBC News NI his organisation had a long-standing relationship with Pastor Pavlenkov's church. ""We have worked with them for 20 years. They are like family to us and we love them very much,"" he said. ""They are going to be staying in Ballymoney and it's our intention that they may be able to help other Ukrainians coming to the country."" He added: ""The village they come from is now occupied by Russian forces so they had to leave. ""It's very difficult to buy food and there is no electricity or water."" The church has helped organised visas for the refugees. Jacqueline Fleming said she was excited to welcome the newcomers to Northern Ireland. ""At first they weren't going to leave their home as its a very hard thing to do,"" she said. ""But then they decided, for their children, they needed to take a bag and go to Poland and eventually come here."" For the families who arrived in Northern Ireland on Saturday, it is the end of one journey but the beginning of another. "

Alison Bird had offered the two-bedroom caravan in Dovercourt, Essex, to a family of four who are squatting in a single room in Turkey. But officials said it was not suitable due to the seasonal nature of caravans and restrictions on year-round occupancy. Ms Bird called for them to reconsider. Meanwhile, she said she did not have the heart to tell the family because they were ""so down and so desperate"". ""I can't add to their worries, so before I say anything to them I'm trying to get Essex County Council to do the right thing and to say 'yes' to our caravan and to look at each individual property on its own merit,"" she said. Ms Bird said said she thought the caravan was ""perfectly suitable"". She said it could be used all-year round, was double-glazed, fully heated, newly decorated and close to local schools. ""It would be perfect for this family,"" said Ms Bird. She said she and her husband had planned to rent it out over summer but it was ""far more important we house Ukrainian refugees than it is to make a bit of money from the caravan"". A spokesperson for Essex County Council and other local organisations involved in the Homes for Ukraine scheme said: ""A decision has been taken as a group county-wide that due to the seasonal nature of caravans, there are restrictions on year-round occupancy and other risks which make them unsuitable housing for refugees, particularly refugee families with children.""

640,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-61126391,2022-04-16T13:54:58,Ukraine war: Russia bans Boris Johnson from country over Ukraine war," Russia has banned Prime Minister Boris Johnson and other senior ministers from entering Russia over the UK's ""hostile"" stance on the war in Ukraine. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss, Defence Secretary Ben Wallace and 10 other senior politicians - mostly members of the Cabinet - have also been barred. Moscow said the decision had been made in retaliation to the UK's sanctions against it since it invaded Ukraine. In March, Moscow imposed a similar ban against US President Joe Biden. The full list is: In a statement, Russia's foreign ministry said: ""London's unbridled information and political campaign aimed at isolating Russia internationally, creating conditions for containing our country and strangling the domestic economy"" were responsible for its decision. It added: ""In essence, the British leadership is deliberately aggravating the situation around Ukraine, pumping the Kyiv regime with lethal weapons and coordinating similar efforts on the part of Nato."" The UK government said it remained ""resolute"" in its support for Ukraine despite the move, adding that it condemned Russia's ""reprehensible actions"" in the country. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon also reacted to the sanctions, describing President Putin as ""a war criminal"" and vowing that she would not ""shy away from condemning him and his regime"". Earlier this week, the UK and US governments announced further sanctions on Russia. The sanctions included financial measures designed to damage Russia's economy and penalise Russian President Vladimir Putin, high-ranking officials, and people who have benefited from his regime. Nato countries - including the UK and US - are also supplying weapons, ammunition and other military equipment to Ukraine, although they have ruled out sending in Nato troops or implementing a no-fly zone. On Wednesday, the US said that more sophisticated offensive weaponry would be sent to Ukraine as part of a $800m (£612m) package. In response, Moscow on Friday warned the US that there would be ""unpredictable consequences"" if it refused to stop sending weapons to Ukraine. Retaliation of this kind was always likely. Russia sees the UK as one of the international actors most intimately involved in efforts to support Ukraine's militarily and isolate Russia economically and politically. Russia's move is unlikely to make a difference to the travel plans of the 13 British politicians. It is unlikely any of them had a trip to Moscow in their diaries. But it speaks to the Kremlin's growing anger at the way the West has responded to its invasion of Ukraine and its willingness to lash out against those who it sees as having played a role in isolating Russia in the past - Theresa May helped to orchestrate the mass expulsion of scores of Russian diplomats from more than 20 Western allies in the wake of Russia's use of a nerve agent in Salisbury in 2018. Russia has warned that further shipments of Western military equipment to Ukraine could result in ""unpredictable consequences"". Banning political leaders is not exactly unexpected. What worries officials in London, Washington and elsewhere is that Russia has the ability, and possibly even the desire, to resort to other military means, including the use of unconventional weapons.

""They're using him for propaganda purposes,"" said Pamela Hall, viewing a clip of her grandson Aiden Aslin from her flat in Nottinghamshire. Mr Aslin had been defending the battered city of Mariupol. Russia has besieged and bombarded Mariupol for weeks and Mr Aslin said his unit had to give themselves up. Thousands of civilians have been trapped in the city, and reports suggest the city could soon fall. Earlier this week, Russia said more than 1,000 Ukrainian marines had surrendered in Mariupol, but Ukraine denied this, saying troops were still fighting. In a final video message, he said ""We've finally exhausted all our resources, run out of ammunition, food, we're just waiting for the command now to lay down our arms and head towards Russian soldiers. Hopefully you'll see something from me in future."" Mr Aslin, originally from Newark in Nottinghamshire, has appeared in photos and video footage on Russian television in which he looked bruised and swollen as he was questioned. ""I was horrified absolutely horrified, my heart stopped,"" said his grandmother, who described the family's shock at seeing him in a brutal image being shown widely to Russian audiences. ""I saw that photograph where his face is swollen, he has a nasty gash. ""Having seen him, I know he's alive but I""m not sure that's a comfort because I don't know how he's being treated."" Unlike many foreign fighters who have travelled to Ukraine since the Russian invasion, Mr Aslin was no newcomer. He had become a marine with the Ukrainian military in 2018, was engaged to marry a Ukrainian, and had made the country his home. The former care worker also previously fought with Kurdish armed units in Syria against so-called Islamic State. He knew of course, the risks of military service, but his grandmother said like many people he never expected the conflict to escalate so quickly. ""We never imagined they would run out of ammunition. If they hadn't they never would have surrendered"" she said. ""He was an official member of the Ukrainian marines and I hope that all of the those guys are treated with respect. He always wanted to help people and had wanted to help Ukraine, and wanted the world to help Ukraine more."" His image is now also being shown widely across pro-Kremlin social media channels. It is a sinister warning as to what may become of someone who is British and may fall into the hands of Russian forces. ""I don't think I'll ever forget seeing his face as he was - he just looks so beaten"" said Ms Hall ""They're using him, for propaganda purposes, whereas the Ukrainian guys are just one of many."" The family say they can only now hope for a prison exchange and they are in touch with the UK Foreign Office. But this conflict is also a battle of propaganda, in which it is now clear the Kremlin are using Mr Aslin for their own ends. Follow BBC East Midlands on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram.

The firm said the move follows the ""enormous human suffering and escalating military action in Ukraine"". L'Occitane told the BBC last week it was keeping its shops open to protect staff from potential ""retaliation"". Some customers had criticised the company for its decision and called for a boycott of the brand. Its products are sold at more than 3,085 retail outlets worldwide and had sales of €1.5bn (£1.3bn) last year. Last week the firm told the BBC it had discussed closing its Russian stores ""at length"" but said it had not because it wanted to protect staff from potential ""retaliation"". The cosmetics firm, which has spas and stores in Russian cities including Moscow and St Petersburg, originally said it could not take the ""risk"" of closing its shops. But in a statement issued on Friday evening, L'Occitane said the decision to shut its Russian operation had been approved by the company's board of directors. ""Given the enormous human suffering being caused by escalating military action in Ukraine and to protect our employees worldwide from potential public aggression, we have decided to close our own stores and e-commerce websites in Russia,"" the statement said. Hundreds of international brands including L'Oreal and Estee Lauder have already closed shops and ceased online sales in Russia in protest at the war in Ukraine. Tweeting a picture of a L'Occitane product one customer said: ""I've used this cream for years, never again. Even if they back out, they've showed their corporate integrity."" A number of firms are still listed as still operating in Russia by Professor Jeffrey Sonnenfeld at Yale University's School of Management. Among them are the French energy giant EDF, the UAE's Emirates airline, and China's Lenovo computer brand. Around 600 big firms have pulled out of Russia or suspended sales since it invaded, including Starbucks, Coca Cola, Levi's and Apple. Other international outlets still open in Russia have said they are not able to shut stores due to complex franchise deals preventing them from withdrawing. Burger King and the hotel groups Marriott and Accor are among the firms restricted by these arrangements. On Tuesday, some independent Nike stores were found to be operating in Russia over a week after the sportswear brand said it was temporarily closing all its shops in the country. Professor Vanessa Burbano, from Columbia Business School in the US, said that consistency between claims and actions is important for brands with operations in Russia. ""Customers and employees do pay attention to which companies are first in making these kinds of commitments and which firms don't go as far,"" Prof Burbano said. ""The risk of companies making claims that may not be perceived as consistent with their actions is that they could be seen as a green-washing in the Ukraine context which would be bad for their reputation.""

In one of the doorways a blackened kettle boils on an open fire, blowing clouds of steam into the bitter air. This place should be buzzing with life and sound, with the chatter of children playing and clambering over the climbing frame that dominates the square. But since the Russians came, everything has changed here. Most people fled, and they're yet to return. There's just one small, hardy group who are trying to pave the way for others to come back. Sergei and his wife arrived at their flat five days ago. Now they and their neighbours are trying to rebuild their damaged homes, and clearing away the debris of countless Russian shells. ""You always want to come back home"", he tells me. ""So we used our first chance to return as well. And we used our chance to make sure that all the property is safe, even from locals that might come and steal something."" Sergei takes me to an open grave in the shadow of his building. It's just a few steps away, and we walk in the deep grooves the Russian tanks carved into the mud as they rolled in. Sergei's neighbour - killed as he tried to take a photo of them - lay here. His name and the date he died are written of a piece of wooden pallet, a rough and temporary gravestone. When Sergei returned home, one of the first things he wanted to do was finally give him a dignified burial. In just a few weeks, Bucha locals have become accustomed to death. Denys Davidoff stayed in the town throughout the occupation. When the Russians left he ventured back onto the streets, and was confronted with a vision of horror. Many people around the world saw photos and videos of bodies lying scattered on the ground in Bucha, some with hands bound behind their backs. But Denys witnessed them himself. ""When I arrived I saw the street with the dead bodies. I just walked around them, and they were everywhere. I wasn't scared, but it was intense. You got used to it during the month of the occupation."" As the world condemned what it saw, Russia claimed the news was fake, and the bodies were planted after its forces left. But Denys lived through it, and that was not what he saw. ""Some corpses were lying for such a long time that you could see their bodies were covered with the sand and the earth after it rained. At some point I realised I knew some of the people who were killed."" The people of Bucha are still processing the devastation they've lived through. But they aren't entirely safe just yet. More than 3,000 pieces of unexploded ordnance have been found around the Kyiv region so far. In a nearby village we pass a ditch at the side of the road, with around 20 unexploded shells neatly placed in it, lying side by side. A single thin ribbon of plastic tape runs around the perimeter to protect the unaware from stumbling in. Making these towns safe again for people to return to will be a huge job. On the road to Bucha, there's an unconventional graveyard. The burned and twisted hulks of Russian military vehicles lie idly by the roadside. This was a camp, a defensive position, and among the wreckage are signs of the soldiers who once lived here. There are small gold foil pots of food rations, vodka bottles, underwear and socks. Mis-matching camouflage, and a civilian brightly-patterned sleeping bag that someone brought along to keep warm. By the remains of a campfire there's a discarded bottle of shower gel, and someone's toothbrush. I find pieces of paper with burned edges and Russian script on them. Our local producer Illya scans them and tells me they're from a rulebook for Russian soldiers, a tome of instructions on how to fight and survive. But they didn't here. There's no silence in this place. Cars and lorries roll by, slowing down for a better look at the wreckage. Locals arrive in a constant stream, then clamber over the destroyed vehicles and pose for selfies. Even the single Russian forearm lying in the grass nearby, its flesh and skin charred black, doesn't deter them. A closer inspection reveals that one of the tanks still has a badly burnt body inside - barely recognisable as human. A small group gathers and one man films it on his mobile phone. In time, this will all be cleared away, and the road will look like it always did. The bodies will be buried, the shattered windows will be mended, and the buildings will be repaired. Eventually the physical reminders of the cruelty that was inflicted will be gone from sight. But for the people of Bucha, the memories will long remain. © 2022 BBC.

Multi-million pound country manors in the south of England and luxury flats in London's most expensive areas are among the homes which have been snapped up by figures linked to Vladimir Putin. Some of the individuals deny ownership of the mansions, which may mean they are beyond the reach of the sanctions. To get to the bottom of who owns what, we carried out a detailed trawl of leaked offshore documents, the Land Registry and court papers - as well as previous reporting. Our findings highlight the UK's status as a place for super-rich Russians to set up home, and the difficulties of identifying the true owners of properties bought by offshore firms in tax havens. In response to the BBC's findings, anti-corruption group, Transparency International highlighted how hard it is to track who owns what in the UK. ""Because of the system of secrecy here in the UK and in relation to the Overseas Dependencies it's really easy for people to hide their assets and their funds in the UK and not even the police necessarily have sight of where those assets are,"" Rachel Davies, head of advocacy at the organisation, told the BBC. The UK, US and European Union have together sanctioned more than 1,000 Russian individuals and businesses, including wealthy business leaders - so-called oligarchs - who are considered close to the Kremlin. Most of those listed below were sanctioned after Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February, although some were already on the government's sanctions list. Properties linked to sanctioned Russians include: In early March, the British government imposed sanctions on the 55-year-old billionaire. The previous week Mr Abramovich had put Chelsea FC up for sale. He has a vast property portfolio in the UK with more than 50 luxury residences, most on Fulham Road in west London. Through his UK company Fordstam Limited, he owns dozens of apartments in Chelsea Village, plus the hotel and residential complex around Chelsea's Stamford Bridge stadium, according to the Land Registry. His most expensive London property is a 15-bedroom house on a street that is nicknamed Billionaires Row. With its vast stucco-faced Italianate mansions, it is home to royalty and ambassadors - as well as oligarchs. Mr Abramovich bought the property in west London using an offshore company in 2011, reportedly paying £90m. In 2016 he was granted planning permission for a £28m refurbishment, including a subterranean pool, although this did not go ahead. In planning documents submitted to the council, its existing pool was described as a ""miserable space"" that was ""too small to afford comfortable or meaningful swimming"". In 2017, Mr Abramovich used Fordstam Limited to buy an apartment just off the King's Road for £8.7m. In 2019, he paid £22.3m for a three-storey penthouse apartment on the former Lots Road power station site in Chelsea. Mr Abramovich did not answer the BBC's requests for comment. The UK government imposed a full asset freeze and travel ban on Alisher Usmanov on 3 March, citing the Russian billionaire's ""close links to the Kremlin"". This followed a similar move by the EU. The Uzbekistan-born businessman and former Arsenal shareholder has been a close associate of Everton's majority shareholder, Farhad Moshiri, who resigned as chairman of Mr Usmanov's USM Holdings in early March following the imposition of sanctions on the oligarch. Everton have suspended all dealings with Mr Usmanov's businesses, including USM's sponsorship of their training ground. His wealth has been estimated at $18.4bn (£14bn), including ""Beechwood House in Highgate [north London]… and the 16th Century Sutton Place estate in Surrey"", the UK government said. But a spokesman for Mr Usmanov said most of the billionaire's UK property, plus a $600m (£456m) yacht, had already been ""transferred into irrevocable trusts"", potentially putting them beyond the reach of sanctions. Tracing the ownership of the two houses targeted by the UK government is extremely difficult. They have been held through a complex web of trusts and companies registered in places like the British Virgin Islands which, until recently, did not require the ultimate owner to be disclosed. Mr Usmanov bought Beechwood House for £48m in 2008 using an offshore company. As part of an investigation with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, the BBC has seen a document showing Usmanov secured a mortgage in 2005 to part-finance payments for Sutton Place via two firms in Cyprus. His two nephews each own multi-million pound properties in north London. When the UK government imposed sanctions on Oleg Deripaska, they described him as worth £2bn and a ""one-time business partner"" of Roman Abramovich. In early March, a court heard that he has a multi-million pound property portfolio in the UK, including the art deco mansion Hamstone House in Weybridge, Surrey. Sitting in eight acres of grounds, the Grade II listed property was acquired for £7.1m by a Cyprus-based company, Edenfield Investments Limited, in 2001. Mr Deripaska also owns a large home in Belgrave Square that was occupied by protestors. However, a spokesman for the billionaire at the time said the property belonged to family members. There is evidence suggesting Mr Deripaska owns a building five minutes' walk from Buckingham Palace. The 17th-Century terrace house was bought in 2004 for £4.7m by Astibe Limited - an offshore shell company incorporated in the British Virgin Islands, which appears in the annual accounts of EN+ (an energy and metals group that Mr Deripaska has a stake in). The property is listed as the address of the company, according to research by Transparency International. A judge has frozen UK bank accounts operated by a British businessman amid allegations they are linked to Mr Deripaska - National Crime Agency investigators believe the accounts were being used to help the oligarch avoid sanctions. A spokesperson for Mr Deripaska said the sanctions were ""deeply misguided"" and based on ""unfounded and hollow accusations"". ""Mr Deripaska has never been involved in politics. It is wrong to suggest that Mr Deripaska is close to the Government of Russia and/or Vladimir Putin,"" the statement read. ""The decision to sanction him has nothing to do with justice or law, neither does the freezing of assets belonging to him or his family."" The UK-based billionaire oligarch Mikhail Fridman had his shares frozen in the investment firm LetterOne, which owns international health food chain Holland & Barrett, after the EU sanctioned him following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. On 15 March, he was also sanctioned by the British government, which said he was ""closely associated with President Vladimir Putin"". Mr Fridman told the BBC that the imposition of sanctions by the UK government left him ""shocked"" and that the statement he was closely associated with Vladimir Putin was ""absolutely incorrect"". LetterOne, which is just under 50% owned by Mr Fridman and Petr Aven (see below), announced the business partners had ""ceased to have any involvement with the company"". Mr Fridman, who is thought to be worth around $12bn, owns a huge property, Athlone House in north London, for which he paid £65m in 2016. Mr Fridman told his local newspaper, the Hampstead and Highgate Express, the building was originally designed for a Victorian industrialist, adding: ""It felt like fate that I, as a businessman, would be similarly drawn years later to the same property and grounds."" Mr Fridman secured planning permission for a significant restoration, including the addition of a wine cellar, cinema room, swimming pool, yoga room and cigar room. Mr Aven was named in EU sanctions as ""one of Vladimir Putin's closest oligarchs"" who ""does not operate independently of the President's demands"". Along with Mikhail Fridman, the Russian billionaire's shares in LetterOne were frozen. Land Registry records show a Cyprus-based company paid £8m in 2009 for his home, Ingliston House in Virginia Water, Surrey. Mr Aven reportedly owns an extensive private art collection, which includes works by Kandinsky, Louise Bourgeois and Henry Moore. He was photographed by the FT at his home alongside some of his pieces. After he was sanctioned by the EU, he stepped down as a trustee at the Royal Academy, which returned a donation from him. Mr Aven told the BBC that his family also owned a two-bedroom apartment and studio in central London. He said he ""strongly disagreed"" with UK government's description of him as a ""pro-Kremlin oligarch"". He said the sanctions against him were ""understandable, but unfair"", adding he saw no fair reason to be sanctioned and that he never operated under the demands of Vladimir Putin. ""My partners and I always tried to be out of politics,"" he said. Born in Kyiv, when Ukraine was part of the Soviet Union, Mr Khan is ""a close associate of Vladimir Putin who has been involved in destabilising Ukraine"", according to UK authorities, which sanctioned him in March. He and and his wife Anzhelika own several properties in England. The Panama Papers revealed the couple have shares in the Seychelles company Apilosa Corporation. Land registry papers show it paid £62m in 2008 for two apartments near Buckingham Palace. German Khan bought two more flats in the area in 2005. In 2018, they were transferred to his wife's name, according to Land Registry documents. The couple also bought a mansion in Virginia Water, Surrey, for £26m in 2014. Records show that the mansion was sold on 24 December 2021 to Ravenmorrow Limited for £31m. It is unclear who now owns the property. Ravenmorrow Limited was set up in December last year and no individual is identified on UK company records as the beneficial owner. Mr Khan did not reply to the BBC's request for comment. The UK government said Igor Shuvalov ""is a core part of Putin's inner circle"" when it imposed sanctions on him in March. Officials confirmed his assets in the UK include two luxury apartments in Whitehall worth an estimated £11m. That was first reported by the Anti-Corruption Foundation, set up by jailed Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny. Land registry documents show the properties are owned by Sova Real Estate LLC in Russia, which - according to official records obtained by the Anti-Corruption Foundation - indicated they were owned by Mr Shuvalov and his wife. In response to our questions, a spokesperson for Mr Shuvalov confirmed that ownership of the apartments had been transferred to a Russian company ""controlled by the Shuvalov Family"" in 2014. The value of the flats significantly exceeds the £634,000 that Mr Shuvalov declared as his and Mrs Shuvalov's joint wealth to the Russian parliament in 2014. Mr Shuvalov's spokesperson told the BBC that these issues ""have been the subject of competent government audits"", and that ""no complaints were ever filed"". In August 2021, Mr Gutseriev was sanctioned by the UK because of his close relationship with Belarus' President Alexander Lukashenko. Mr Gutseriev was the founder of Safmar Group, a Russian conglomerate, but is no longer involved in the company. Mr Gutseriev's son Said, a British citizen who has not been sanctioned, now part-owns SFI - a company previously known as Safmar Financial Investments. The Pandora Papers revealed Said Gutseriev owns a multi-million-pound City of London office block bought for more than £40m through a secret offshore company. Said Gutseriev's representatives told the BBC he did not have ""any business links with his father"". His lavish wedding, which made headlines in 2016, featured performances by Jennifer Lopez and Enrique Iglesias. Yuri Soloviev is a high-ranking executive at sanctioned Russian bank VTB and was sanctioned by the UK government on 15 March this year. The 51-year-old has Russian and British citizenship. According to US Treasury officials, his wife Galina Ulyutina ""was previously implicated in a golden passport scheme"" in Bulgaria. Golden passport schemes allow nationals of one country to acquire citizenship in another through investment. Mr Soloviev owns two London properties in his own name. One is a penthouse in Hampstead, the other is in Westminster. A third apartment near Kensington Palace was bought outright in the name of a relative for £2.2m in 2006 and revealed in the 2016 Panama Papers leak. A spokesperson for VTB told the BBC that Mr Soloviev ""left VTB group on 24 February 2022"", the day that Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine. ""Mr Soloviev was not sanctioned by any countries while working at VTB,"" the statement added. The chairman of the management board of state-owned Gazprombank, Andrey Akimov, was sanctioned by the US in 2018. He was sanctioned by the UK earlier this month. According to Catherine Belton in her book Putin's People, he is a former intelligence operative and ""one of the most important financiers behind Vladimir Putin's regime"". Working with the International Consortium of Journalists, the BBC has seen evidence in the Pandora Papers leak that link Mr Akimov to property in London. Land Registry documents show that Mr Akimov's partner Marianna Chaykina owns an apartment in Knightsbridge. It was bought for £10m by British Virgin Islands (BVI) company Inma Investments in 2012. Ms. Chaykina is listed as co-owner of a number of Mr. Akimov's firms in leaked corporate records and she has been described by Russian media as Mr. Akimov's wife. The BBC received no response to its questions from Mr Akimov. Polina Kovaleva is the stepdaughter of Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, according to the UK government. Lavrov was sanctioned by the British government at the same time as Vladimir Putin. A few weeks later, on 24 March, the UK government sanctioned Ms Kovaleva too - saying she reportedly owns a London property worth £4m. Land Registry documents show Polina Kovaleva bought an apartment in Kensington with no mortgage in 2016, when she was 21. Ms Kovaleva did not reply to the BBC's request for comment. Arkady Rotenberg is one of Vladimir Putin's closest friends - the pair sparred in the same judo gym in St Petersburg. The US and the EU imposed sanctions on him in 2014 following Russia's annexation of Crimea. He is also under sanction in the UK, with the government citing his ""close personal ties to President Putin"". His brother Boris and son Igor were added to the sanction list last month. In July 2020, an investigation by the US Senate accused the Rotenberg brothers of using secretive purchases of expensive art to evade sanctions. Upper Ribsden in the village of Windlesham was bought in 2012 for £27.5m by Ravendark Holdings Limited, a company registered in the BVI. It received a loan of over £30m from another BVI company said to be owned by Mr Rotenberg. In November 2021, a High Court judge ruled the house was held on trust for the benefit of Mr Rotenberg by Ravendark. That was appealed and the case has yet to be decided. Mr Rotenberg did not reply to the BBC's request for comment. The difficulty faced by senior judges and lawyers in establishing who owns a UK mansion illustrates how hard it can be to trace the assets of sanctioned oligarchs. Update 27 May 2022: This article has been amended to clarify the business dealings of Said Gutseriev. Additional reporting by Jon Kelly and James Oliver Design by Jana Tauschinski "

Friday proved Kyiv was still far from safe. Russia said it hit a plant just outside the city that makes anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, and claimed the attack was in response to a Ukrainian helicopter attack on a Russian village. Ukraine denies it carried out that attack. Moscow then warned it will respond to any Ukrainian attacks on Russian territory by striking Kyiv with more missiles. Read in full The discovery of bodies in areas surrounding the Ukrainian capital continues, more than a week after Russian troops left the area. ""Regretfully, I can say that we have found the bodies of 900 deceased civilians and transferred them to forensic experts,"" Kyiv Region Police Chief Andriy Nebytov said on Friday. He added that more than 350 of the bodies were retrieved from Bucha - where evidence of atrocities has led to accusations of war crimes against Russian troops, vehemently denied by Moscow. BBC journalists have seen bodies in civilian clothes on the roads outside Kyiv, and documented the sizeable operation to collect and identify the dead in Bucha. Russia has told the United States there will be ""unpredictable consequences"" if it refuses to stop sending weapons to Ukraine. A diplomatic note was sent to the Biden administration, the Washington Post first reported. The US recently announced that more sophisticated offensive weaponry would be sent to Ukraine as part of a $800m (£612m) package. Much of the focus of the war in Ukraine has so far been about the battle on the ground - but the fight to dominate the skies is just as important. The BBC's Jonathan Beale was given an exclusive interview with a Ukrainian air defence officer about the battle for control of Ukraine's skies. ""Past wars have shown, whoever dominates the air wins the war,"" Captain Vasyl Kravchuk said. Information is still trickling out about a Russian warship that sunk on Thursday - however there are still many unanswered questions and contradictions. Moscow says the Moskva, the flagship of Russia's Black Sea Fleet, was being towed to port when ""stormy seas"" caused it to sink. Kyiv says its missiles hit the warship. The US has now said it also believes the cruiser was hit by two Ukrainian missiles. Ukraine has said the captain of the warship was killed on board, but this has not been confirmed.

Churches in Ukraine will be closed during the curfew for Orthodox Easter, taking place on Sunday 24 April. The news has been reported by Ukraine's police, the Orthodox Church of Ukraine and the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church.

648,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-61122240,2022-04-15T21:03:56,Homes for Ukraine: Robert Jenrick takes in Ukrainian refugee family," A former cabinet minister has taken in a refugee family under a government scheme to help those fleeing Ukraine. Robert Jenrick, the MP for Newark, and his family have welcomed Maria, 40, Christina, 11, and Boden, 15, into their Nottinghamshire home. He is thought to be the first MP to take in refugees under the Homes for Ukraine scheme. Mr Jenrick said both families had found it ""very emotional"" when they finally met in person at Stansted. ""I think the family we are sponsoring were happy to be in a place of safety,"" he told the BBC. ""Like most Ukrainians who come under the scheme they are leaving behind husbands, fathers, relatives and friends so there are mixed emotions."" The former communities secretary said his family had discussed doing something to help after being moved by the news from Ukraine, and had been put in touch with the family through another Ukrainian family who was staying with friends. ""The process was relatively slow to begin with but well worth the wait from our perspective,"" he said, adding that Maria and her family had been ""absolutely lovely"". As of Wednesday 25,100 visas have been issued under the Homes for Ukraine Scheme - which allows families in the UK to sponsor refugees to come and live with them - from 55,600 applications. Since it began the scheme has faced criticism for being slow - and Home Secretary Priti Patel has previously apologised for the delays in granting visas. Several MPs and government ministers have previously said they would be open to hosting a Ukrainian refugee. Environment minister Victoria Prentis was the first to welcome one, according to the Telegraph, although Vika came to the UK via an existing scheme, not Homes for Ukraine. Mr Jenrick said that he was hoping to arrange places at school for the two Ukrainian children now under their roof in the coming weeks. While he said he would encourage anyone who was lucky enough to be in the position to host a refugee to do so, he said that it was a commitment which ""should be entered in to seriously"". ""But I think it is going to be a very rewarding experience for my family,"" he said, adding that it had made them grateful for the life they have in the UK. Mr Jenrick told the Daily Telegraph's Chopper's Politics podcast - which first reported the story - that the process had been ""overly bureaucratic"" and red tape had ""tested the patience"" of sponsors and the families applying for the scheme. In his experience, he said it took around three weeks to get the three visas needed. ""There were simple things that we could and should have done from the outset, like having the form in Ukrainian, for example,"" he told the Telegraph, adding he was not sure it was necessary for security checks to be done on minors who were ""extremely unlikely to be a threat to this country"". But Mr Jenrick said it had not been too difficult to find a family wanting to come to the UK. It has meant a busier house with the Ukrainians joining Mr Jenrick, his wife, their three children and two dogs in the family home. But he told the Telegraph's Christopher Hope the experience had been humbling for him and his family, and said they would be ""a little less selfish"" for the experience. Maria and her children had been through ""harrowing"" experiences in Ukraine, he said, and had queued for seven hours at the Polish border on their way to the UK. ""It does feel very rewarding,"" he said. ""It's a very tangible way to reach out and help another family."" He added that he was looking forward to spending the Easter weekend with his ""new extended family"". Asked if he had received the £350-a-month payment being offered to hosts as part of the scheme Mr Jenrick said that either they would return the money or it would be given to the Ukrainian family. There are two schemes for people in the UK to welcome refugees: the family scheme, for Ukrainians with a family member in the UK; and Homes for Ukraine, which lets people in the UK host Ukrainians who do not have family ties here.

Moskva, the flagship of Russia's Black Sea Fleet, was being towed to port when ""stormy seas"" caused it to sink, according to a ministry message. The 510-crew missile cruiser was a symbol of Russia's military power, leading its naval assault on Ukraine. Kyiv says its missiles hit the warship. The United States says it also believes it was hit by Ukrainian missiles. Moscow has not reported any attack - it says the vessel sank after a fire. The blaze caused the explosion of the warship's ammunition, Russia says, adding that the entire crew were later evacuated to nearby Russian vessels in the Black Sea. After saying initially the warship was afloat, late on Thursday the Russian defence ministry announced that the Moskva had been lost. The 12,490-tonne vessel is the biggest Russian warship to be sunk in action since World War Two. ""While being towed... towards the destined port, the vessel lost its balance due to damage sustained in the hull as fire broke out after ammunition exploded. Given the choppy seas, the vessel sank,"" the Russian defence ministry said. Ukraine has said the captain of the warship was killed on board. Anton Gerashchenko, an adviser to Ukraine's ministry of internal affairs, shared the claim on Telegram, saying that the ship's captain, Anton Kuprin, had died during an ""explosion and fire on board"". The BBC has not been able to verify this claim. Ukrainian military officials said they struck the Moskva with Ukrainian-made Neptune missiles - a weapon designed after Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014, and the naval threat to Ukraine in the Black Sea grew. The US now also believes the Moskva was hit by two of these missiles, a senior official said on Friday. Speaking on condition of anonymity, the official told the Reuters news agency that the US believes there were Russian casualties, though numbers are unclear. A senior Ukrainian official said as many as 510 crew could have been on board the Moskva. On the first day of Russia's invasion of Ukraine on 24 February, the Moskva gained notoriety after calling on a small garrison of Ukrainian border troops defending Snake Island in the Black Sea to surrender - to which they memorably radioed an expletive-laden message of refusal. Originally built in the Soviet-era, the Moskva entered service in the early 1980s. The vessel was actually laid down in Ukraine's southern city of Mykolaiv, which has been heavily bombed by Russia in recent days. By Jenny Hill, BBC News, Moscow This is a significant and humiliating loss for Vladimir Putin, who has repeatedly insisted that his ""special military operation"" in Ukraine is going according to plan. Unsurprisingly, perhaps, Russian state media are not dwelling on the loss of the pride of the Black Sea fleet. Morning TV bulletins limited themselves to briefly reporting the statement issued by the authorities, who claim the ship sank in stormy seas after fire and explosions on board caused significant damage to its hull. Some newspaper commentators appeared to support that, arguing that the fire extinguishing systems on board the forty-year-old warship were out of date and inefficient but several writers agree that the development won't change the course of war. It is however a blow to national pride; the Moskva, once a symbol of Russian might and ambition, now lies at the bottom of the sea. While one TV talk show host didn't speculate on Ukraine's claims that it had struck the ship, a clearly emotional studio guest - film director and ex-MP Vladimir Bortko - said the fate of the Moskva was grounds for war. ""It's more about psychological damage than material damage,"" Mykola Bielieskov from Ukraine's National Institute for Strategic Studies told the BBC. ""It won't remove Russia's naval blockade on Ukraine completely,"" he said. ""But it's a powerful symbol that we can employ sophisticated weaponry effectively."" But Mr Bielieskov, who advises the Ukrainian government on military strategy, did predict that ""Russian ships will now be forced to move further from the Ukrainian shore, where they can no longer feel secure."" The Moskva didn't itself fire missiles at Ukrainian land targets, but military experts told the BBC that it offered crucial support to other vessels that did. The remaining vessels in Russia's Black Sea fleet will now be more vulnerable to aerial attacks - although it's not clear that Ukraine's depleted forces have the resources to take advantage of this. ""The Moskva was the only ship in the fleet which had long-range air defences on board,"" said Sidharth Kaushal, a sea power expert at the Royal United Services Institute. ""While smaller vessels were conducting bombardments of Ukrainian cities, the Moskva was providing them with wide-area air cover."" The guided missile cruiser was previously deployed by Moscow in the Syria conflict where it supplied Russian forces in the country with naval protection. It is the second major vessel Russia has lost since the start of its invasion. Admiral Lord West, former First Sea Lord and Chief of the Naval Staff, said that as well as being a military blow the vessel's loss was ""very embarrassing"". ""This has a huge impact,"" Lord West said, speaking to BBC Radio 4's PM before confirmation that the Moskva had sunk. ""Putin loves the navy. When he came into power, the first bit of the old Soviet forces that he put effort into was the navy. He's always had a soft spot for it."" "

But even for a BBC picture correspondent, meeting a leader in his secret wartime headquarters was a ""weird and surreal experience"". David McIlveen, from County Down, has spent much of the Ukraine conflict in the capital, Kyiv. This week he joined presenter Clive Myrie to interview President Volodymyr Zelensky at his heavily fortified base. Mr McIlveen said the president had a real presence and an aura. ""To actually be there in the room with the man is pretty weird,"" he told BBC News NI's Evening Extra programme on Friday. He described a warren of corridors at the secret location, filled with guards and sandbags. After introductions, the crew was taken to the government's situation room, where Mr McIlveen saw maps all over the walls. During the interview, President Zelensky repeated calls for more weapons to be sent to help Ukraine in its war with Russia. He also said European countries were ""earning their money in other people's blood"" by buying oil from Russia. The war is not the first time Mr McIlveen has worked alongside presenter Clive Myrie. Mr McIlveen, who has worked for BBC Northern Ireland, won Camera Operator of the Year at the 2021 RTS Journalism Awards for the pair's reporting on coronavirus wards in London. In the meeting with President Zelensky, he said he noticed how the war had taken a toll on the leader and his staff, with fear and pressure ""etched in the faces"". ""When you compare a photograph of what Zelensky looked like at the beginning of the war to now, you can very much see it in his face. It's written all over it, frankly."" Kyiv continues to be a target for Russian attacks despite the withdrawal of troops from much of the territory it held north of the city. ""The battle has moved slightly further away from Kyiv now, where we are currently, and it's moved more into the east, but don't be under an impression that there isn't still a threat here in the city,"" Mr McIlveen added. ""Even today (Friday) we have had two or three air raid sirens go off and, after what happened to the Russian flagship being sunk, there have been very overt threats from Russia that they're going to carry out air strikes at the heart of government here in the centre of Kyiv. ""That would very much include the locations where they presume Zelensky to be, so everyone in that building is well aware of the risk of even being there - and that's before they worry about the pressure of doing their job."" There was, however, a lighter moment during the meeting when the president received a text from France's leader Emmanuel Macron. No state secrets were revealed, Mr McIlveen joked, but ""even that he took in his stride and it was all good fun"". Asked about the president's confidence that Ukraine could win the conflict, Mr McIlveen said he got the sense that the staff remained positive. ""I genuinely believe that certainly the inner staff who were in that room, they think they can win this thing, if they're provided with the weaponry."" "
652,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-61117056,2022-04-15T13:10:06,Ukraine war: Russia threatens to step up attacks on Kyiv," Moscow says it will respond to any Ukrainian attacks on Russian territory by striking Kyiv with more missiles. The ""number and scale"" of attacks will go up if its own settlements become targets, the ministry said. The warning came as Russia announced a missile strike on a military factory near Kyiv, which it claimed was in response to a Ukrainian helicopter attack on a Russian village. Ukraine denies it carried out the attack. ""Tonight, sea-based high precision long-range ""Kalibr"" missiles hit a military facility in the outskirts of Kyiv,"" Russian defence ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov said. The strike targeted Ukraine's Vizar military facility that was producing and repairing anti-aircraft and anti-ship missile systems, Mr Konashenkov added, warning that Russia would intensify missile attacks on Kyiv if Ukraine continued what he described as attacks on Russian land. He said: ""The number and scale of missile strikes against objects in Kyiv will increase in response to the commission of any attacks of a terrorist nature or sabotage on Russian territory by the Kyiv nationalist regime."" Andrei Sizov, a 47-year-old owner of a wood workshop near the factory, told the AFP news agency that the blasts came overnight. ""Around 1:30am, my security guard called me because there was an air strike,"" he said. ""There were five hits. My employee was in the office and got thrown off his feet by the blast."" He also said he believed Russia was taking revenge for the sinking of the Moskva warship, which Ukraine claims it hit with Neptune missiles. On Thursday Russian officials accused Ukraine of sending two helicopters 10km (6 miles) into Russia's Bryansk region, bombing a residential building in the village of Klimovo and injuring eight people. Kyiv denies the attack and accused Russia of staging the incident to stir up ""anti-Ukrainian hysteria"". The BBC has not been able to verify the claims. Russian forces started withdrawing in March from around the Ukrainian capital to focus on Russian efforts to seize eastern parts of the country, but Kyiv remains vulnerable to missile strikes. In its statement the Russian defence ministry made no mention of the sinking of its Black Sea naval flagship overnight. The military factory targeted in the strike produced anti-ship missiles, including some similar to the Neptune ones that Ukraine claims to have used to attack and sink the Moskva vessel. The Russian account of the warship's sinking differs. Moscow defence officials claim an unexplained fire onboard caused ammunition to explode, ultimately causing the Moskva to ""lose its balance"" as it was being towed to port. It is still not independently confirmed how the heavily-defended Black Sea flagship sank. "

""We want people to know they are coming to a safe place and will not be exploited. The visa application is entirely separate."" The Government says it is processing visas as quickly as possible, but accepts that progress has not been quick enough in some cases. A spokesperson said the Home Office has made changes to visa processing and the application form had been ""streamlined"". ""Ukrainian passport holders can now apply online and do their biometrics checks once in the UK, and greater resource has gone into the system,"" they added.

The Royal Welsh regiment has been leading a 1,200-strong Nato training taskforce in Estonia, bordering Russia. Estonia's permanent secretary for defence, Kusti Salm, said the threat from Russia was ""as clear as anything can be"" after the Ukraine invasion. He called on Nato to double troops stationed in the country. Estonia's President Alar Karis warned earlier this week that Mr Putin's government could use hybrid warfare, including cyber attacks, against his people. The troops, who are in Tapa, near the eastern border with Russia, are ready to meet any challenge ""head on"", according to Lt Col Ru Streatfeild. He said: ""Our role here is to deter and to be ready to defend. ""Regardless of what happens we are ready for that. That's what this exercise is about and it's given confidence to our people. We are ready."" BBC Wales' Newyddion S4C was given access to a training exercise for any potential attack, which included ground troops, tanks, armoured vehicles and aircraft from the UK, France, Denmark and Estonia. Fusillier Jack Wilkes, from Tywyn, Gwynedd, also has confidence the current force could combat any threat to the east. He said: ""You've got to be professional and ready to move at any time. I think we are. I'm confident with all the boys we'd be ready [to counter a Russian attack]."" Mr Salm said more troops in Estonia would help the country ensure it would be able to fully combat any threat from its neighbour. ""I think this is what Nato needs to do to in order to face the threat coming from Russia,"" he told BBC Wales, claiming Russia has ""made no secret about their intent to eventually dismantle Nato"". Another soldier, Rhydian Stephens, 23, said there was a sense of frustration of being on the outside looking in on events in Ukraine, but he said the their role in Estonia was important. ""Obviously it's not our job to make those decisions, but we are looking at the news and seeing what's happen and we do want to help. It's what we joined the army to do - to help. ""But obviously we need to be here in Estonia - that's why we're here."" "

Steven Barnes' fiancée Olga Nimak, along with her children and mother, are now living with him in Cirencester following weeks of uncertainty. They arrived on 8 April and say they have been made to feel very welcome as they settle in to their new home. ""To have them here and see them in the flesh is wonderful,"" said Mr Barnes. He applied under the family visa scheme to bring his fiancée and family to the UK but said he had been frustrated with the protracted process as they were ""stuck in limbo"" for weeks. ""It's so nice after all this waiting, planning and not knowing. Psychologically it has been stressful. ""It's just about sinking in now. I've been worried because it's things out of my control. ""When I was working and went to get a cup of tea, I said how nice it felt to have life in the house, noise, cooking, people moving around, it feels much more homely now. People have been so supportive,"" he said. Ms Nimak fled Ukraine and travelled to Poland with her mother and children. Her father remains in Ukraine but she hopes he will be able to join them in time for her wedding to Mr Barnes on 7 May. She said she stayed busy while waiting in Poland by helping to match people fleeing Ukraine with UK hosts. ""The children are getting on very well. It's been a shock and they've been under stress, but it feels right being here,"" Ms Nimak said. ""They were a little scared of using the playground and talking to kids but we have plans to help them settle in. ""They are scared people won't like (as) they are from Ukraine, but they don't understand people are kind here and kids in the UK know what's going on so have sympathy for them,"" she added. The community has donated clothing and toys for the family and Ms Nimak said her mother cried when the Ukrainian national anthem was played in the local church to welcome them.

656,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-61105013,2022-04-14T23:00:55,Ukraine: Returning home to a country still at war," At Ukraine's western border with Poland near the town of Mostyska, Olena and Maria walk back into their home country after more than a month abroad. The pair are from Slovyansk in the eastern Donetsk region. On 10 March, as Russian invaders drew closer, Olena's husband told her to take their daughter Maria and leave the country. Olena and Maria headed to a friend's house in Szczecin, a Polish city on the border with Germany. But they had to sleep on the floor, and Olena says they struggled to find work there because they don't speak the language. Now, they're heading back east - despite the threat of a renewed Russian assault. Donetsk remains a key target for Russian forces. Olena's husband is an ambulance driver and still in Slovyansk, waiting for them. When we ask how they feel to cross back into their home country, Olena breaks into a huge grin. ""Super!"" she says. ""No matter what, we're very happy to be back in Ukraine."" Since Russia's invasion, more than 10 million people are thought to have left their homes in Ukraine, and 4.3 million of those have left the country. But as the front lines stabilise and the country learns to function in a state of war, some Ukrainians are beginning to make the journey back home, even to parts of the country directly threatened by Russian forces. The war is now well into its second month. Ukraine has held off the Russian assault and fears of a rapid collapse - as President Volodymyr Zelensky told his people this week, it is more than 48 days since military analysts in the West predicted the capital Kyiv had just 48 hours until its fall to the invaders. People the BBC spoke to at the Polish border said they had tired of life as refugees abroad. Others were desperate to get back for practical reasons - to collect important documents left behind in the confusion after the invasion, protect their homes from looters, or even to pick up children who stayed behind with their fathers. And for others, the pull of home, friends and family is just too strong. Sofia is eating a hot dog from one of the fast-food stalls at the border crossing. She's defying her mum's orders, choosing to come back home after just three weeks in the safety of Poland. War is war, but Easter is Easter - she's eager to see her loved ones back home in Lviv this weekend. The 20-year-old first crossed the frontier into the EU late in March to stay with a godmother's friend in Poznan, after the Russians bombed her home city. ""Mum forced me, she was panicking,"" Sofia says. But she never felt settled abroad, despite the help for refugees that humanitarian groups and the Polish government have organised. ""You feel foreign,"" she says. ""Everyone's helping you, but it doesn't feel like home."" She hopes to stay in the relative calm of Lviv. Official figures suggest more people are making the same choice. Polish border authorities say numbers going to and from Ukraine are now drawing closer - on Wednesday, 24,700 people entered Poland from Ukraine, while 20,000 people made the opposite trip. It's a sharp reversal from the record 142,000 people who crossed into Poland on 6 March. Lviv-Holovnyi rail station is a key transit hub in western Ukraine. Trains bring thousands in daily from war-torn regions: outside, charities give out food, clothes and SIM cards, while coaches line up to take travellers off to the countryside or the border. Although most people come here from the east, a steady stream of people are starting to make the journey in the opposite direction - a potentially lethal choice. Iryna, her daughter Katerina, mother Lina and mother-in-law Yevgenya are from Kryvyi Rih, a city in central Ukraine close to the front lines. They initially left the country to stay with relatives in Moldova, but have now decided to return. They've had to buy tickets for the trip - in contrast, journeys westward away from the fighting are free. Iryna says they would have come sooner, but had to wait for her eight-year-old daughter to recover from an illness. ""Home is home,"" she says, when we ask why they've decided to go back. She admits she's worried about her daughter's safety. When they left, the Russian attacks were far away, but now they're getting closer. We ask what they've told Katerina about the situation. ""We're telling her the truth,"" Iryna says. Some warn against moving back east. Volunteers at a clinic above the main station concourse give out medical and psychological support for new arrivals. Irena Bous is one of them. Before the war, she was a judge for the International Dance Organization and chair of a number of dance competitions within Ukraine. ""All kinds - hip hop, jazz, break dancing,"" she says. A friend of hers in the Lviv governor's office knew she had a flair for organisation and so asked her to help out when the Russians invaded. Irena has met several people who are returning to areas wracked by violence. ""It's a bad idea [to return east],"" Irena says. ""We try to save their lives and keep them in Lviv."" She tells us of a woman who came to Lviv from her home near Bucha, a wealthy suburb of Kyiv where Russian troops shot dead scores of civilians and left bodies in the street. After nine days, she decided to return - against Irena's advice. ""I said, please wait, there are no Russians but we have many things there - bombs, mines - wait until they are deactivated,"" Irena says. The woman travelled back regardless, saying her friends had found her a place to stay. Another woman Irena spoke to, who is in her 60s, had fled to Poland even before the war began, but returned to Ukraine and boarded a train east last week. ""I don't know how long I will live, but I will die in my house,"" she told Irena. Others we met couldn't bring themselves to leave Ukraine in the first place. At Arena Lviv - a stadium built for the Euro 2012 football tournament, but now playing host to refugees - we meet Roma, a 19-year-old from Mykolaiv on Ukraine's Black Sea coast, and his new friend Iryna, a grandmother from Severodonetsk in the eastern Luhansk region. The pair had never met until that day, but now they have decided to stay together. Iryna travelled across Ukraine to the Polish border in the days after the invasion, intent on escaping. After queuing for hours, she made it to the front of the line, only to change her mind at the last minute. Her son is in the military in Ukraine and she hears her home city has been recaptured by Ukrainian forces, opening up the prospect of heading home. ""I couldn't bring myself to leave [the country],"" she tells us. But since then, she has been moving around the west of the country, sleeping for a time at a nursery in Lviv before ending up at the arena with Roma. A coach destined for the countryside has one spot left on board, but despite repeated offers, Iryna refuses the seat - choosing instead to stick with her new friend. Now she and Roma - like millions of others - face an uncertain future as displaced people within the country. With a choice of refugee status abroad or rootlessness inside Ukraine, it is perhaps no surprise that some are risking everything to return to their homes. "
657,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-61109104,2022-04-14T23:00:31,'I'm shocked by my church leaders in Moscow' - priest in Ukraine," The Russian Orthodox Church has echoed the rhetoric of the Kremlin in justifying the war in Ukraine. It is a stance that appears to be driving large numbers of Ukrainian priests and parishioners to turn their backs on Moscow. ""I will never forget the moment when I woke up early to go to mass, only to suddenly hear the shocking sounds of bombing,"" says Father Nicolay Pluzhnik. ""The wonderful woman who cooked at our church and her son, who was in a wheelchair, were both killed when an artillery shell hit their apartment. I now know of several other of our parishioners who have died."" Like most clergy in the region of north-eastern Ukraine where he is from, Father Pluzhnik belonged to the branch of the Russian Orthodox Church which takes its direction from its religious leadership in Moscow. But now, he says, has applied to join the Ukrainian Orthodox Church - which was finally granted independence from the Russian Orthodox Church in 2019, in a move never recognised by Russia. He says many fellow priests who followed Patriarch Kirill in Moscow are doing the same because of the Church leader's stance on the war. Father Pluzhnik and his family fled under artillery fire and now have a temporary new home in the town of Chernivtsi, in western Ukraine. ""When the war started, I was waiting to hear from Patriarch Kirill of Moscow, the 'father' of our church. But first there was no reaction at all, and then there was worse,"" he says. ""Patriarch Kirill blessed the Russian army and gave his blessing to the war. It was not just him but the majority of priests of the Moscow Patriarchate [Russian Orthodox Church] including some that even have Ukrainian roots. I was in shock."" As well as having failed to unequivocally condemn the killing of innocent people in Ukraine, or call for a ceasefire, the Patriarch has held large televised services in Moscow to bless Russian troops. He has also suggested in sermons that the Kremlin's war is a righteous one about the future of Christianity. ""What is happening today is much more important than politics,"" he said last month. ""We are talking about human salvation, about where humanity will end up and on which side of God the Saviour."" There are religious undertones in much of the Kremlin's narrative justifying its invasion of Ukraine. It is a fight for the conservative ideals of the Russian Orthodox Church based in Moscow, against an immoral outside world. President Putin has said Ukraine is not only an ""inalienable part"" of Russia's history and culture - but also its ""spiritual space"". The former Archbishop of Canterbury, Dr Rowan Williams, has said he finds Patriarch Kirill's sentiment concerning. ""There are elements in the Russian Christian tradition that can become really toxic when they get in their head a particular kind of Christian nationalism, a sort of messianic approach to the fate of the nation,"" said Dr Williams during a visit to western Ukraine this week. He was part of an extraordinary high-level, multi-faith delegation - including Christian, Jewish, Muslim, Hindu and Buddhist leaders. They met refugees who had fled the horrors in the eastern part of the country. Dr Williams has long studied and written about the positive contribution of the Russian Orthodox Church, and appears deeply saddened by the role the Moscow Patriarchate is playing in the war. ""I think that the increasing influence in the Patriarchate of Moscow of ultranationalist ideals - often including a strand of anti-Semitism - has been going on for some time. ""And it has now expressed itself in this very uncritical support of Russian national ambitions, a very aggressive attitude towards many other Orthodox churches. The writing has been on the wall for some time,"" he said. Patriarch Kirill has echoed President Putin's claim that Russian speakers and followers of Moscow's Russian Orthodox Church living in eastern Ukraine need liberating after years of oppression. ""Our brothers and sisters were really suffering, they suffer for their loyalty to the Church,"" said Patriarch Kirill a week into the war. But Father Pluzhnik, a Russian speaker and a follower of the Moscow Patriarchate all of his adult life, is angered by those claims. ""When I hear them say they are protecting us and fighting some 'Holy War', I think they are either blind, or they are not serving God but the devil,"" he says. ""We were living peacefully until they came. But far from protecting us they bombed and tortured and killed. Before the war, parishioners were completely free to choose what church they went to, they just went to the church closest to their home. For many of them it was not even a significant difference to go to a church that followed Moscow or not, they just wanted to pray to God. Now that has changed."" Dr Sergii Bortnyk, a professor at the Kyiv Theological Academy and an adviser to the Russian Orthodox Church in Ukraine, acknowledges that there has been a widespread movement of people and parishes across the country abandoning their loyalty to Moscow. ""I think it is maybe half of the 12,000 parishes [of the Moscow Patriarchate in Ukraine] that have said that they want to break away now,"" says Dr Bortnyk. ""Patriarch Kirill has not said anything about all the Christians in Ukraine that have been killed, so I believe the members of our church are free to end their connection to him as the patriarch,"" he says. ""The connection to all of our [Moscow Patriarchate Russian Orthodox] Church in Ukraine to Moscow is in question now."" The Kremlin's aim, backed by the leadership of the Russian Orthodox Church in Moscow, had been to unite Russia and Ukraine in a single ""spiritual space"". But the manner by which they have tried to achieve that appears to have had precisely the opposite effect. © 2022 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.

658,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-61106245,2022-04-14T23:00:05,Ukraine's battle for control of its skies," Much of the focus of the war in Ukraine has so far been about the battle on the ground - but the fight to dominate the skies is just as important. The BBC has been given an exclusive interview with a Ukrainian air defence officer about the battle for control of Ukraine's skies. Captain Vasyl Kravchuk has a surprisingly ready smile for a man who has endured 50 days of war. We spoke to him via video link from his base at an undisclosed location. He knows the coming weeks will offer no respite. Russia may have received a bloody nose in its aborted attempts to take Kyiv, but with the Eastern region of the Donbas now firmly in Moscow's sights, the men and women of Dnipro's Anti-Aircraft Missile Brigade will continue to play a key role in the next phase of the war. Defending Ukraine's skies from Russian attacks is already proving a challenge. As another Ukrainian air defence officer told the BBC, it is like trying to use a giant fly swatter which had large holes in it. ""We can't cover the whole airspace,"" Capt Kravchuk says simply. The fact he is even sitting here speaking to us is somewhat remarkable - especially given the fact that ""many air defence facilities were destroyed fully or partially"" in the first days of the war. It's a rare public admission by Ukrainian forces that they suffered significant losses in the early stages of the war. But despite these losses, the air defences which survived have still been used to good effect. Oryx, which has been tracking military losses during the war using visual confirmation, says that Ukraine has destroyed, damaged or captured at least 82 Russian aircraft, including jets, helicopters and drones. Ukraine's equivalent aircraft losses stands at 33. Indeed, their successes have confounded military experts, who predicted that Russia would quickly achieve air superiority over Ukraine. Russia already had a significant advantage in the air, deploying more than three times as many combat aircraft as Ukraine. The US Pentagon says that Russian aircraft have been flying around 250 military missions and carrying out some 30 air strikes every day. Western officials still say that Russia is struggling to gain air superiority. But in contrast, Ukraine's aging fleet of mostly MiG-29 fighter jets have been struggling to compete, managing at best around 10 military missions a day. Ukraine knows that Russia has the upper hand in the air. That's why its repeatedly called on Western nations to close its skies. But Russia's anticipated offensive in the Donbas presents a new, more difficult challenge. Justin Bronk, senior research fellow for airpower at the Royal United Services Institute, says Russia is likely to have greater freedom of access in the airspace over the eastern region than the rest of the country due to its proximity to Russian controlled airspace. In order to win the fight here, Ukraine requires a mix of long, medium and short range weapons to provide what's known as a ""layered defence"". The West has been providing a significant number of shorter-range surface-to-air missiles. The US alone has already sent 2,000 Stingers. The UK has provided an unspecified number of Starstreak high velocity missiles too. But while Capt Kravchuk says his country is grateful for those shoulder launched weapons, known as Manpads, he says they're only effective on the frontline. This is because Manpads - man-portable air defence systems - are most effective against low flying aircraft. Russia is mostly using long range cruise missiles and high-altitude bombing. Capt Kravchuk told the BBC: ""We now lack medium and long range air defence systems... we do not have enough."" A renewed Russian offensive in the Donbas will put another serious strain on Ukraine's limited air defence. While the focus of the war has turned to Eastern Ukraine, the rest of the country still needs protection. On the ground, we've seen evidence that Ukraine has been sending additional air defence systems to the east in recent days. But it can't afford to redeploy all its air defence systems to the Donbas region. ""We cannot leave half of Ukraine completely without protection,"" Capt Kravchuck says. Ukraine is having to use its air defences not just to target Russian aircraft, but also Russian cruise and ballistic missiles. They are having some success, but they can't destroy everything. Capt Kravchuk estimates that his unit is shooting down between 50-70% of Russia's longer-range missiles. As an example, he says when Russia fired six missiles around Dnipro recently they managed to stop four. That still suggests a significant number are getting through. The Pentagon says that Russia has launched 1,550 missiles since the war began. Russia says it's also been using hypersonic missiles. There isn't much Ukraine's air defences can do against those as they travel at five times the speed of sound. But the harsh fact is that, without more significant support, Ukraine will find it increasingly hard to defend itself from Russian air and missile strikes the longer this war goes on. A senior western intelligence official told the BBC that long and mid-range air defences were top of the list of Ukraine's requests for more weapons supplies: ""They're very specific that they need air defence ammunition… they do need those in large quantities."" And as Capt Kravchuk told us: ""Past wars have shown, whoever dominates the air wins the war."" "
659,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-61113079,2022-04-14T22:17:11,Behind the scenes in Zelensky's modern HQ," The soldiers at the checkpoint scrutinised our passports, then waved us on. We were inside the grounds of the building that was being used as the headquarters of the resistance against Russia's invasion. Barbed wire, mines and machine gun mounts ring the building. Heavily armed soldiers were everywhere - the person I was about to meet is a marked man. The Kremlin would love to see Volodymyr Zelensky dead and his government replaced with a puppet regime installed by Moscow. But over the 50 days of this war, Ukrainian resistance has stunned the world. We passed our equipment through two sets of metal detectors and were ushered inside. Then it was down a series of long corridors, with sandbags piled up every few yards. A little hole was left in the pile near the top, through which the muzzle of an assault rifle might fit. An aide to the President led us to a door with a brass plate on it: the words read The Situation Room, in Ukrainian. Inside, the room looks modern, with giant plasma screens covering the walls and trendy office chairs on wheels sporting ergonomic backrests. But there was a problem. Interviewing people sitting on chairs with wheels can be tricky. Lost in their responses to questions, they tend to shift from side to side on the wheels. So we asked the president's aide for chairs with no wheels. ""Umm,"" he says, ""I'll have a look."" He left the Situation Room and returned with two rather old-fashioned-looking chairs, all brown wood with patterned seats. ""That'll do the trick,"" I say. But I could see the president's chief of staff's lip curl. ""No, that won't do,"" he said. ""The chair looks too old-fashioned in this room of modern computers and plasma screens. We're trying to project a modern image here."" And with that, two more modern-looking chairs were produced - with no wheels. The discussion over the chairs highlighted so much for me about modern Ukraine. Since the end of the Cold War, a vibrant, young population has looked West for its influences. Cheap Ryanair flights to Western Europe opened up possibilities. This administration wanted us to know that they were informal, different, ready to talk. I then heard several footsteps coming down the hall. Two soldiers entered the room and behind them was the president. As we greet, an aide handed him a phone. On it was a text message, from France. ""Is it Emmanuel?"" he asked the aide? ""Yes,"" came the reply. ""We have a connection and he calls me all the time,"" the president tells me. ""Do you mind if I give him a quick call?"" ""Absolutely,"" I say, surprised that he asked me whether or not he should call the president of France back straightaway or try him later. But that's part of the measure of Volodymyr Zelensky, an affability and charm that comes so naturally. However, there were times over the next hour when I could tell he was angry and upset: when he recalled visiting the town of Bucha, about 25km (16 miles) north-west of central Kyiv, that Russian forces had occupied for several weeks. After they pulled out, a mass grave was discovered near a church and there were bodies lying in the street. I asked him if he believed Vladimir Putin is a war criminal. His response was that anyone connected with the Russian military, and their civilian masters, were war criminals. ""Given everything that's happened, would you be able to sit around a negotiating table with with these people and talk peace?"" I asked. ""The window of opportunity is receding,"" he replied, pointing to the atrocities in Bucha and Borodyanka as the main driver of that thought. Mr Zelensky is, of course, a former comedian and actor. But during the hour I was with him, I saw a man mentally exhausted and in deep pain about the treatment of his people. A man who has been compared to Churchill and who many will remember for his leadership through the dark days of war. "

Throughout the day there were conflicting reports on how the 12,000-tonne vessel was damaged. Russia said a fire on board caused ammunition to explode and that the crew had been evacuated. The warship was being towed to port when ""stormy seas"" caused it to sink, according to a Russian Defence Ministry message. But Ukraine said it was responsible for the attack, claiming it targeted the cruiser with recently-introduced Ukrainian made missiles. Whatever the cause, it is bad news for Moscow. It is the flagship of Russia's Black Sea fleet, and, as such, a symbol of Russia's military power. Read more here Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky gave an exclusive interview with the BBC's Clive Myrie today. The most pressing issue he wanted to discuss was European countries continuing to pay for Russian oil, from which Russia makes billions every week. President Zelensky singled out Germany and Hungary, accusing them of blocking efforts to embargo energy sales. He also said he thought tens of thousands may have been killed in the besieged port city of Mariupol. He added that after visiting Bucha - a town near Kyiv where civilians were found executed - he felt nothing but hatred for the Russian army. Read more about what the president told Clive Myrie here. A British man has reportedly been captured in Mariupol while defending Ukraine.

The club's director Eugene Tenenbaum and another oligarch David Davidovich are longstanding business associates of Mr Abramovich. The pair's assets - estimated to be worth up to £10bn ($13bn) in total - have been frozen. UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said it was the largest asset freeze in UK history. Read more here "

Russian sources claim Aiden Aslin, who is originally from Newark in Nottinghamshire, has been captured in the besieged city of Mariupol. On Tuesday his family told the BBC his unit was having to prepare to surrender to Russian forces. Mr Aslin has now appeared in photos and video footage restrained in handcuffs. His mother Ang Wood told the BBC: ""I believe it is him in the photographs. We just want him to be treated according to the Geneva Conventions. ""We are just hoping that maybe there can be some sort of prisoner exchange. We don't know what else to do right now except keep pressing the Foreign Office."" The BBC has asked the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) for a response. Mr Aslin has a Ukrainian fiancée and now has dual citizenship, after moving to Ukraine in 2018. His grandmother Pamela Hall told the BBC: ""I never expected this, I thought if the worst came to the worst that Aiden would die fighting. ""Obviously I didn't want that, I wanted the war to end and for him to go home to his fiancée."" Mr Aslin had been defending Mariupol with his unit during heavy fighting in recent weeks. ""I think all the guys should be treated as prisoners of war according to the Geneva Conventions; I appreciate it's opposing forces, but they're all human beings,"" his grandmother said. ""We are all just hoping and praying for his safety."" Mr Aslin is a former care worker who previously fought with Kurdish armed units in Syria against so-called Islamic State. He passed out as a marine with the Ukrainian military in 2018. His family understand his unit is the 36th Marine Brigade. A video is being shown on Russian television news in which Mr Aslin is being questioned. The interviewer first asks in Russian whether he understands the language, to which he replies in Russian ""50/50"". He is then asked whether he killed anyone, and the interviewer also says: ""Did you see others killing anyone in your presence?"" Mr Aslin replies in English: ""I didn't do any fighting."" By Emma Vardy, BBC News correspondent Aiden Aslin is clearly being used to maximum advantage as a tool for Russian propaganda, interviewed by a Russian TV reporter while being held captive. In a lengthy segment, the news anchor and reporter refer to Aiden in brutal terms, calling him a ""head cutter"". During the interview, Aiden appears to back up propaganda that Russian state media has been putting out since the start of the invasion. He states he has seen Ukrainian soldiers killing Ukrainian civilians. A classic Kremlin claim regularly made by Russian officials, despite huge amounts of evidence of atrocities against civilians committed by Russian forces. We cannot know under what duress Aiden may have been prior to this interview, but one thing is very clear. These are not the words of the Aiden Aslin from a few weeks ago, when he was speaking to family from the conflict and regularly posting social media updates. Loved ones will tell you he was very proud of his role as a marine in the Ukrainian forces, and believes strongly in defending civilians. His grandmother told the BBC: ""Aiden was not a mercenary as some of these Russian posts are saying. ""He has never been a mercenary and his involvement with the Ukrainian forces came about because he made Ukraine his adopted home, and he was due to marry his fiancée.

Luton Borough Council said it had written to the government after some people arriving at London Luton Airport had to be temporarily placed in hotels. There was also an issue processing young people arriving as unaccompanied asylum seekers. The situation was having a ""detrimental effect"" and could prevent them getting a job, the meeting heard. Service director for housing, Colin Moone, said: ""We're currently administering the Homes for Ukraine scheme. ""That only involves us getting the parties together who've agreed to be matched already. ""We've also had to place Ukrainians in some of our hotels because there isn't a process in place from the Home Office to deal with them."" Director of children's operations Alison Parkinson said there were also issues with the processing of unaccompanied asylum seekers, the Local Democracy Reporting Service said. ""Currently, there's a substantial delay with the Home Office progressing young people who should have had their cases heard,"" she said. ""We're pushing back hard to the Home Office saying this is having a detrimental effect on these young people. ""This is impacting on their ability in some cases to gain employment. ""We're asking for an approach to be considered where they can access employment while processing [continues]. ""That's a very active debate we're having with the Home Office.""

President Putin has said that Moscow will ""redirect"" its energy exports to ""rapidly growing markets"" elsewhere. China has sought to remain neutral on the conflict, calling for a peaceful solution. But it has yet to condemn the Russian invasion and has criticised western sanctions. Bilateral trade with Russia surged in the first quarter of the year, rising by 28% from the previous year, according to Chinese customs data. In March, after Russia launched its invasion, overall trade between the two countries rose over 12% from a year earlier. China accounted for around 18% of Russia's overall trade in 2021 - almost $147bn (£110bn) last year . During President Putin's visit to Beijing in February for the Winter Olympics, the two countries said they would boost trade to $250bn by 2024. However, as a bloc, the EU remains by far the biggest overall trading partner with Russia. In 2021, total trade between the two was worth almost twice as much as China's trade with Russia. That could now be changing. ""It is inevitable that EU-Russia trade diminishes in the light of sanctions,"" says trade economist Dr Rebecca Harding. ""The current crisis has just sharpened a focus within the EU on the need to diversify supply"". China is one of the biggest markets for Russian oil, gas and coal. Just a week before the Ukraine invasion, the two countries agreed on a new Russian coal deal worth more than $20bn. Mr Putin also unveiled new Russian oil and gas deals with China worth an estimated $117.5bn. The two countries aim to build a new gas pipeline (the Power of Siberia 2). The existing one began operation in 2019, under a 30-year contract worth more than $400bn. However, Russia's biggest energy market by far has been the EU, and it supplies 40% of the bloc's gas and about 26% of its oil. ""Russian exports of oil and gas [to China] have been increasing at a rate of over 9% annually for the last five years"". says Dr Harding. ""This is rapid growth but even so, China is half as big as the EU market for Russian oil."" The EU is reducing its reliance on Russian energy by cutting its gas imports by two-thirds in the wake of the Ukraine war. Germany, Russia's main export destination for natural gas, has announced that it would suspend the new Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline. Supplies via a new pipeline agreed between Russia and China would have only a fifth of the capacity of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, according to one analysis. Also, it's not clear when the new gas pipeline from Siberia will come on stream. Over the longer term, China may want to boost imports of Russian gas to try to reduce its dependence on coal in order to meet targets for cutting greenhouse gases. But data shows that China's crude imports from Russia dropped 9% in the first two months of 2022. Its state-owned refiners are also reported to be cautious and not currently signing new Russian oil contracts. Moscow has asked China for military equipment in support of its invasion of Ukraine, according to US official quoted in media reports. China says this is untrue and has called the reports ""disinformation"". In recent years, most of the movement in arms has been the other way. China has relied heavily on Russian military hardware to modernise its armed forces, made increasingly necessary by the imposition of US and European arms embargoes in the wake of the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown. About 80% of China's total arms imports were from Russia between 2017 and 2021, according to Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI). These Chinese purchases make up 21% of Russia's total arms exports - its second largest global customer. But China has been gradually expanding its own military production capabilities. It's now the world's fourth largest arms exporter. ""China's weapons are getting more advanced now. Its drones, for example, are one area that Russia would be very interested in,"" says Siemon Wezeman at SIPRI. But, he says, ""so far we haven't seen any evidence"" that Russia has bought Chinese drones. Some Russian banks have been banned from the Swift international payment system. This has forced companies in China, as elsewhere, to cut back purchases from Russia as traders struggle to arrange financing. Both China and Russia have encouraged moves towards alternative payment methods in recent years. Russia has its System for Transfer of Financial Messages (STFM) while China has the Cross-Border Interbank Payment System (CIPS), both of which operate in their own currencies. But Swift has continued to dominate the financial transactions in the global trading network. Currently only about 17% of trade between Russia and China uses the Chinese yuan (up from 3.1% in 2014), according to media reports citing official Russian statistics. Energy trading between the two countries is still mostly done in US dollars. But report suggests that several Chinese firms used yuan to purchase Russian coal and oil in March. China is a major importers of grains such as wheat and barley and one of its most important sources is Russia - one of the world's largest producers. Until very recently, China had placed restrictions on the importing of wheat and barley from Russia because of disease concerns. But these were all lifted on the day the Russian assault on Ukraine began. Read more from Reality Check Send us your questions "

Chelsea FC director Eugene Tenenbaum and David Davidovich are longstanding business associates of Mr Abramovich, who owns the club. The pair's assets - estimated to be worth up to £10 billion in total - have been frozen. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said it was the largest asset freeze in UK history. They join a list of individuals to have been sanctioned following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, including Russian President Vladimir Putin's two adult daughters. This will prevent their financial assets being sent back to Russia. The total number of individuals sanctioned by the UK since February now stands at 106. Mr Tenenbaum previously described himself as one of Mr Abramovich's closest business associates. Corporate filings show that he took control of Evrington Investments Limited, an investment company linked to Mr Abramovich, on 24 February. Mr Davidovich then took over the company in March. He is also subject to a travel ban, meaning he is cannot enter - or remain in - the UK. Ms Truss said: ""We are tightening the ratchet on Putin's war machine and targeting the circle of people closest to the Kremlin. ""We will keep going with sanctions until Putin fails in Ukraine. Nothing and no one is off the table."" These sanctions were co-ordinated with action taken by authorities in Jersey earlier this week. On Tuesday, Mr Abramovich had $7bn (£5.4bn) worth of assets linked to him frozen by a Jersey court. In the US, a Gulfstream private jet owned by Mr Abramovich has been effectively grounded as the US Commerce Department said it was one of a number of planes to contravene US sanctions. Currently it is a criminal offence for any Russian aircraft to fly to, or land in, the UK. The government has powers to remove aircraft belonging to designated Russian individuals and entities from the UK aircraft register, even if the sanctioned individual is not on board. Russian ships are also banned from UK ports. "

In an interview with the BBC, President Zelensky singled out Germany and Hungary, accusing them of blocking efforts to embargo energy sales, from which Russia stands to make up to £250bn ($326bn) this year. There has been a growing frustration among Ukraine's leadership with Berlin, which has backed some sanctions against Russia but so far resisted calls to back tougher action on oil sales. ""Some of our friends and partners understand that it is a different time now, that it is no longer an issue of business and money,"" Mr Zelensky told the BBC from his situation room in Kyiv on Thursday. ""That it is an issue of survival."" The president also reiterated calls for more weapons to be supplied to Ukraine, saying they were not getting supplies fast enough to fend off Russia's assault. ""The United States, the United Kingdom, some European countries - they are trying to help and are helping,"" he said. ""But still we need it sooner, sooner and faster. The key word is now."" Russian troops have in recent weeks pulled back from around Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, and other central and northern parts of the country - apparently abandoning an attempt to seize all of Ukraine by force. But there are fears now of a bloody and protracted conflict in the east and south of the country, as Russian President Vladimir Putin refocuses his military campaign there in an effort to seize more territory. The southern port city of Mariupol - a strategic goal for President Putin - has already been devastated by weeks of Russian artillery bombardment. President Zelensky told the BBC he thought tens of thousands may have been killed in the city. ""We also have information that as well as those tens of thousands of dead, many have disappeared,"" he said. ""We know their documents have been replaced, they were given Russian passports and taken deep into Russia - some to camps, some to other cities. No one knows what is happening to those people. No one knows how many have been killed."" Mr Zelensky said the atrocities apparently committed by Russian troops in Mariupol, and in the Kyiv suburbs of Bucha and Borodyanka, had further narrowed the possibility of peace talks with the Russians. Hundreds of dead have been found in Bucha since it was taken back by Ukrainian forces a little over a week ago, including civilians who were found shot in the head with their hands tied behind their backs, as well as widespread reports of sexual violence. ""Bucha is in the process of closing [the possibilities of peace talks],"" President Zelensky said. ""It's not about me - it's about Russia. They will not have many more chances to speak with us."" He said he had ""experienced the entire spectrum of emotions"" when he visited Bucha last week, but ended the day with ""nothing but hatred towards the Russian military"". He accused President Putin and the rest of the Russian army ""from top to bottom"" of being ""war criminals"". Mr Zelensky defended his leadership in the run-up to the Russian invasion that began in February, when his government urged the Ukrainian people to remain calm. He said the government had been working in the background to agree deals for weapons and supplies, as well as focusing on avoiding panic that could trigger a run on the banks and destabilise Ukraine's economy. ""That was what Russia - and not just Russia - wanted, but we didn't let that happen,"" he said. ""But we did not expect the full-scale invasion when it happened."" Ukraine is now facing a renewed attack in the east and south as Russia attempts to carve off more territory, following its 2014 annexation of Crimea. President Zelensky said the east now represented the ""most difficult situation"" for Ukraine's armed forces, ""but this is where our most powerful units are concentrated"". ""They can destroy us, but we will answer; they can kill but they will also die,"" he said. ""I can't understand for what - I can't understand why they came."" "

Speaking at a press conference, Mr Coveney said the brutality and violence shown by Russian forces are likely to be war crimes. ""Even though Ireland is a militarily neutral country, let me be clear, we are not neutral on this war,"" he added. ""We are also not neutral on the future of your country."" Ireland has a long policy of military neutrality going back to World War Two and is not a member of Nato. However, it has politically supported Ukraine and Mr Coveney pledged to use Ireland's membership of the UN Security Council to bring the ""madness"" to an end. Mr Coveney is planning to visit several areas across the country that have been affected by the invasion. He is also meeting Ukraine's foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba and defence minister Oleksii Reznikov. His discussions will include how Ireland can continue to provide political, security and humanitarian support to Ukraine. They will also focus on how Ireland can assist Ukraine in its application for EU candidate status, and to bring forward further EU sanctions on Russia. Ireland has provided €20m (£16.6m) in humanitarian aid to Ukraine and Ukrainian refugees in neighbouring countries. A further €33m (£27.4m) has been provided in non-lethal assistance through the European Peace Facility for the Ukrainian military. Mr Coveney was collected at the Polish border by Ukraine Special Forces, who took him to a secure location in the capital. He is accompanied by Ireland's ambassador to Ukraine, Therese Healy, a political adviser and a protection team. "

Businessman Jamie Hughes will host a woman, Maria and her three sons after buying the three bedroom property in his hometown of Wrexham. Mr Hughes picked up the keys last Friday after paying £100,000. A team of volunteers have started renovating and furnishing the house, hoping it will be ready by the beginning of May. ""We got the keys on Friday - we've been putting plans together as to what we'll do and when,"" Mr Hughes said. ""Today the action has started. We've had tradesmen in and out all day - we've got painters and decorators in at the moment."" A local carpet company has agreed to provide new flooring and new mattresses, while other furniture has been donated. Mr Hughes set up a Facebook group asking for help. So far 300 people have pledged their support, including teachers and those with language skills to help the family settle. The mother, Maria, worked in anaesthetics in Ukraine and hopes to find a job in the local area to support her sons aged 10, 12 and 14. Ian Mawdsley, who is an experienced volunteer helping refugees with the St Vincent de Paul charity, said support would need to be more than just material. ""Really, friendship and compassion - that's what the world is short of, isn't it?"" he said. ""If they can make them welcome - without being overbearing, that dividing line between being too helpful and not being helpful enough is very, very fine. ""Through my experience, people who befriend people on a one-to-one basis, with a long-term friendship, that they don't expect anything out of, that's essential."" Julie Simkins is helping Mr Hughes co-ordinate the volunteers working on the house and is confident it will be ready when the family arrives in the first half of May. ""We are pretty organised. We've got a plan. ""The main thing is getting it painted, getting the beds made and then it's just a case of getting the furniture in all the rooms and turning this house into a home,"" she said. "

What is it like for those hoping to provide a safe haven for people fleeing the war in Ukraine? Jackie Bullen, from Royston in Hertfordshire, is hoping to welcome Natalia and her 23-year-old daughter Mariia. She said the pair, from Vinnytsia in west-central Ukraine, were ""in a fire station made into a refugee camp in Poland, just stuck there waiting to get their visas"". ""Everyone is being very kind but it's a difficult environment."" Ms Bullen said when she signed up for the Homes for Ukraine scheme ""I assumed the government would match you with people, then I realised that isn't happening"". ""I managed to find a group on Facebook, I put up there I'm happy to host and described the accommodation and Natalia got in first."" She said their first conversation was ""quite emotional"". ""Odessa had its first bombs and they had rockets go over their homes for the first time that day and they were desperately waiting for Mariia's passport,"" she said. The 23-year-old student received her passport two days later and they were able to leave Ukraine. Ms Bullen told the BBC they applied for their visas 10 days ago and ""every moment of the day I'm anxious to get them here"" but she said the process is ""obstructive"". ""I'm beyond frustrated. I can't believe a system can't be put in place that's more user-friendly. ""I'm angry and I wake in the middle of the night thinking is there anything more we can do but there isn't, it's down to the Home Office."" Lord Dannatt is sponsoring two people who came from Chernihiv, a mother and her 17-year-old son who is on the autistic spectrum. The former head of the British army, who lives in south Norfolk, said they crossed the Ukrainian/Polish border on 29 March. He said they were met by a group from Norfolk who were helping refugees including David Powles, the editor of the Eastern Daily Press, who put them in touch with him. They are now in Dunkirk and after a trip to Brussels to get the 17-year-old's passport extended ""the application has gone in"", he said. Lord Dannatt added: ""Whereas other European countries have, open-armed, welcomed a very large numbers of refugees into their country we are applying a quite complicated visa system."" Speaking to Jeremy Vine on BBC Radio 2 he said he travelled to Portcullis House in London as a member of the House of Lords to check on the application process of the two refugees he is sponsoring and four others. He encourages others waiting for visas to ""raise the case to your MP"". ""We've still got a very complicated process and it needs to be simplified,"" he said. One person who has had success getting visas and refugees to the UK is George Munns, a farmer in the Fens. A family of five, including a six-year-old girl and twin boys aged two, from central-west Ukraine are due to arrive and move into a house he owns in Chatteris, Cambridgeshire. ""They are in Italy in a hostel, it's a pretty dire situation but it is a safe situation nonetheless,"" he said. The farmer has rental properties, one of which was due become vacant in the early part of March, and following the invasion of Ukraine he kept it empty in case a scheme was started. ""I set up a Facebook page and made it known we had this property surplus at the moment."" He said once he found the family, turning others down was ""the hardest thing I've ever done in my life"". He said he has been speaking to the family over the two weeks to ""keep their morale up because the government takes a long time to sort the visas out"". ""It took us three weeks and three days, it was longer than we anticipated,"" he said. ""I understand the government's concerns but it would be nice if it was quicker. ""It was frustrating, it was worrying because you put in the application and you don't hear anything until you get a result - that was terrible for me."" Although he says the process has been ""difficult"" he hopes it will be worth it. ""In 20 years time there will be a girl of 26 and two boys of 22 and I would have given them a future and that's why we do it."" A government spokesperson said: ""In response to Putin's barbaric invasion we have launched one of the fastest and biggest visa schemes in UK history. ""In just four weeks, over 40,000 visas have been issued so people can rebuild their lives in the UK through the Ukraine Family Scheme and Homes for Ukraine. ""We are continuing to speed up visa processing across both schemes, including boosting caseworkers and simplifying the forms and we expect thousands more to come through these uncapped routes.""

671,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-61101735,2022-04-14T04:58:18,Ukraine war: Farmers stretched to the brink in Odesa," Every now and again, Boris lights a cigarette and nervously smokes away as he watches workers on his farm remove and repair parts of a ploughing machine. ""The decision to continue sowing and to continue work was caused by the fact that you need to work in order to pay salary to workers, to pay people from whom I rent this land,"" he tells me. Boris has asked us not to use his surname for this story. Even though much of the Odesa region on Ukraine's Black Sea coast has been spared from the heaviest fighting, nothing is guaranteed. Russian troops seized the city of Kherson 200 km (125 miles) to the east and its navy is believed to have up to 30 war ships stationed in the waters, from where they fire missiles on land and threaten to stage an amphibious landing. Thirty-eight-year old Boris sent his wife and two sons abroad for fear of a possible occupation. He stayed to keep the farm running through the war and as he opens a vast warehouse the size of two or three football pitches, he reveals just how tough his job is. Stored in a massive pile is about 1,000 tonnes of black sunflower seeds, used to make cooking oil. Ukraine is the world's biggest exporter of seed oil. But right now, Boris cannot sell his harvest because, he says, ""the Black Sea is closed and there is no way to sell products. Existing channels for sale unfortunately offer very low prices, which are not profitable."" Boris says if he does not sell this stock within 18 months, it will rot here on his farm. A cruel irony, considering the increasing number of people around the world who are struggling to put food on their tables. Russia's shock invasion of Ukraine in late February has had a big knock-on effect on global food prices. According to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation, the price of vegetable oils increased by 23% in March, wheat prices by 20% and maize 19.1%. Ukraine and Russia are big exporters of these commodities. Prices had been rising before the war because the Covid-19 pandemic disrupted supply chains and bad weather affected harvests: this is now another strain for families. In Chornomosk, an hour's drive east from Odesa, I meet Roman Skyba. With a shaved head, beard and leather jacket, he could fit in at a trendy bar or restaurant anywhere in the world. His job is to make sure food supplies get to your favourite eatery, perhaps. ""In normal life, we ship grain cargoes: corn, wheat,"" he tells me as he shows me around his now almost empty warehouses. ""In the port of Chernomorsk, about 12 to 14 ships are now moored at the berths. There are approximately 400,000 tonnes of grain crops on board these ships. And the countries to which these goods were supposed to go under contracts will not receive them,"" he adds. The grain from Mr Skyba's warehouses is usually destined for Egypt, Lebanon and Saudi Arabia, which are already experiencing price hikes. All along Ukraine's Black Sea coast, Russia has staged a blockade and millions of tonnes of grain cannot leave. Both countries also accuse one another of dropping mines in the waters, making sailing hazardous not only for their vessels, but those from neighbouring countries too. So what would happen if the war was to end soon? How quickly could shoppers around the world feel some relief? Mykola Gorbachov is president of the Ukrainian Grain Association, which represents 40 major exporting companies. On the phone from the capital, Kyiv, he tells me: ""For the moment, we have enough stocks, about 20 million tonnes of grain. And we can export these immediately because all grain infrastructure survived."" But should the conflict continue, Mr Gorbachov is worried that many farmers will be able to survive only one more harvest without selling their crops before they become bankrupt and shut down their operations. It will be even harder to kick-start global trade from here after that. With key production areas in Mykolaiv, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia under Russian occupation, his association expects that the next harvest will be 40% lower than the last one. ""Farmers will not go to the fields in some territories, there are too many mines which have to be disarmed by the military. We will see decreasing yields, because there won't be enough fertiliser and farmers will use cheaper seeds,"" he says. Despite Ukraine's large grain stocks, it's becoming harder to feed its own people. In the centre of Odesa, Nika Teplyts is hard at work at her bakery. Looking at its string lights and perfectly lined-up pastries, you wouldn't know that there's a war going on outside the quiet of the café. But Nika's bakery is running on reserves it stocked before the war - and she's worried there are wheat shortages to come that will affect her ability to bake. ""Some parts of the country have now been cut off. And the logistics were also blocked. Because of this, there is already a clear lack of supplies that will be distributed to our region as well,"" she tells me. Back on the farm, Boris says he'll keep fighting the evil that's trying to destroy his business and his country. ""People will feel the consequences around the world,"" he says. ""Long enough, even after the end of the war, because the world has changed."" As Ukraine's farmers are stretched further to the brink, the more pressure world leaders will face to end this war and to help families put food on their tables. "

The firm told the BBC it had discussed closing its stores ""at length"" but said it had not because it wanted to protect staff from potential ""retaliation"". It has stopped shipping to Russia but website sales still seem to be open. Hundreds of international brands including L'Oreal and Estee Lauder have already closed shops and ceased online sales in Russia in protest at the war. Some customers criticised L'Occitane for its decision and called for a boycott of the brand which is sold at more than 3,085 retail outlets worldwide and had sales of €1.5bn (£1.3bn) last year. The cosmetics firm, which has spas and stores in Russian cities including Moscow and St Petersburg, said it could not take the ""risk"" of closing its shops. ""At this point we cannot guarantee that our 700 employees in Russia will not face retaliation if we cease to operate in the country,"" a spokeswoman told the BBC. ""We are particularly concerned for those of our employees who have relatives in Ukraine or who are of Ukrainian descent,"" she added. ""At the same time, we are firmly committed to our partners and their employees in Ukraine."" The firm said it strongly condemned Russia's ""unjustified and unprovoked"" invasion and had significantly scaled back its operations in Russia, suspending its investment plans and all shipments into the country. It refused to comment on whether it had continued online sales in the country and what the impact of stopping shipments would have on its Russian shops. Tweeting a picture of a L'Occitane product one customer said: ""I've used this cream for years, never again. Even if they back out, they've showed their corporate integrity."" L'Occitane is one of a number of firms listed as still operating in Russia by Professor Jeffrey Sonnenfeld at Yale University's School of Management. Among them are the French energy giant EDF, the UAE's Emirates airline, and China's Lenovo computer brand. However, a much larger group of around 600 big firms have pulled out of Russia or suspended sales since it invaded, including Starbucks, Coca Cola, Levi's and Apple. Other international outlets still open in Russia have said they are not able to shut stores due to complex franchise deals preventing them from withdrawing. Burger King and the hotel groups Marriott and Accor are among the firms restricted by these arrangements. On Tuesday, some independent Nike stores were found to be operating in Russia over a week after the sportswear brand said it was temporarily closing all its shops in the country. Professor Vanessa Burbano, from Columbia Business School in the US, said that consistency between claims and actions is important for brands with operations in Russia. ""Customers and employees do pay attention to which companies are first in making these kinds of commitments and which firms don't go as far,"" Prof Burbano said. ""The risk of companies making claims that may not be perceived as consistent with their actions is that they could be seen as a green-washing in the Ukraine context which would be bad for their reputation.""

Across this shattered country, testimony is being gathered and evidence collated for a goal that may only come long after the guns fall silent - international justice. The pursuit of it is being led by Ukraine's Prosecutor General, Iryna Venediktova, appointed two years ago as the first woman to hold the office. She watched the exhumation of another mass grave this week, beneath a gold-domed church in Bucha, where the darkest of sins were discovered - 10 victims this time, some completely charred. Their remains were placed into body bags and taken off for an attempt at identification. As she stood at the edge of the deep pit, she told me more than 6,000 cases of war crimes have already been opened. ""A lot of people speak about the genocide of the Ukrainian people - and we actually have grounds to talk about genocide,"" she said. ""Vladimir Putin is the president of the aggressor country killing civilians here in Ukraine. He's responsible."" The Kremlin continues to deny such allegations. The challenge for prosecutors will be to draw a direct line of responsibility from the top of the Russian state to the atrocities on the ground - and show that they weren't just committed but ordered. Russia is not party to the International Criminal Court (ICC) in the Hague, having withdrawn in 2016. Nor, in fact, is Ukraine, although it does accept the court's jurisdiction for crimes committed within its territory. The possibility of ever seeing President Putin himself in a tribunal is thought to be extremely slim. But Ms Venediktova insisted it was her government's ultimate aim. ""It's very important, not just for Ukrainians,"" she said, ""it's important for the whole world to stop dictators."" The efforts of the Ukrainian state are being helped by a network of volunteer investigators, deploying across the country in a grassroots quest for justice. Among them is an NGO called Truth Hounds, whose staff have been trained by former prosecutors from the ICC. We followed them to the town of Borodyanka, some 50km (31 miles) north-west of Kyiv, which has been gutted by a month-long offensive and occupation. The destruction is immense. Apartment blocks have been wrenched apart or blown open. Entire streets lie in ruins. And amidst the devastation of shattered glass and mangled metal lie the remnants of cluster bombs, whose use is banned under an international convention. Roman Koval from Truth Hounds said they had gathered eyewitness accounts that the Russians gave orders to attack buildings once they were already in control here. ""They knew this city was full of civilians, with no combatants left, and they tried to raze it to the ground,"" he said. The investigators' work, he added, went beyond documentation of attacks; it was one of establishing the truth - and of collective memory. ""We're trying not to let Russia formulate their lying narratives about the war in Ukraine,"" he said. ""We're trying to show people that the war crimes that Russian troops are committing became a pattern of their behaviour, not just in Bucha or Borodyanka, but all over the occupied territories."" He picked his way through the ruins of an apartment belonging to Oksana and Nicola Laba, which was ravaged by the shock waves of an airstrike next door. Much of it has been reduced to rubble. Crouching amid the debris - fragments of broken glass covered any place to sit - he listened to their testimony and took notes. The details will be added to a central database as the war crimes case against Russia builds. Oksana told of how her mother managed to flee just before the airstrike hit. ""Our home was our cosy nest, where we were planning our children's birthday,"" she recalled. ""It's hard to describe our terror - it's more like hate."" Storytelling here carries with it the hope that accountability will be pursued. ""It's very important to say what happened,"" Oksana said, ""because these are not just war crimes: Russia will not stop until it destroys our country."" On the scarred street outside, diggers have started to clear up the wreckage of homes and once-happy lives. The freedom and safety that Ukrainians cherished has been destroyed. But their solace now would be to see - and believe - that there will be punishment for those who have broken this country. "

Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said only a fraction of the help given to Ukraine was given to other humanitarian crises. Assisting Ukraine is ""very important"" because it ""impacts the whole world"", he said. But Tigray province in Ethiopia, Yemen, Afghanistan or Syria are not receiving the same attention, he said. ""I don't know if the world really gives equal attention to black and white lives,"" Mr Tedros told a news conference. ""I need to be blunt and honest that the world is not treating the human race the same way. Some are more equal than others. And when I say this, it pains me. Because I see it. Very difficult to accept but it's happening,"" he added. Tedros, who is from Tigray, said the United Nations had determined that 100 trucks per day of life-saving humanitarian supplies were needed for the Ethiopian region. War broke out in Tigray between the TPLF - a group that dominated Ethiopian politics for nearly three decades - and the government in November 2020 following months of simmering tension. The fighting has seen thousands killed - including civilians - while millions are in desperate need of humanitarian aid, with the federal government accused of hampering relief efforts. All warring parties have allegedly carried out extrajudicial killings and used sexual violence. The UN calls Yemen the world's worst humanitarian crisis. In Afghanistan, the UN says 24 million people need humanitarian assistance to survive. Syria has been at civil war for 11 years. Around half a million people have been killed and millions have been displaced in the conflict. Russia invaded Ukraine 50 days ago on Thursday. War crimes prosecutors visiting the site of civilian killings in the town of Bucha have called Ukraine a crime scene, while US President Joe Biden has accused Russian forces of committing acts of genocide in the country. "
676,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-61100091,2022-04-13T20:44:03,Ukraine round-up: Biden and Macron at odds over Putin 'genocide'," The United States has historically been reluctant to accuse states of genocide. The UN Genocide Convention, of which the US is a signatory, requires countries to intervene once genocide is formally identified. But amid mounting evidence of atrocities in Ukraine, President Joe Biden has now accused Russian President Vladimir Putin of being guilty of what has been called the ""crime of all crimes"". He said President Putin was committing acts of genocide by trying to ""wipe out the idea"" of a Ukrainian identity. Not everyone is ready to go as far. French President Emmanuel Macron said he was reluctant to use the word, stating that he was ""not sure that an escalation of rhetoric serves that cause"". But what is genocide, and is there evidence that Russia is guilty of the crime in Ukraine? The BBC's George Wright took a look at the arguments for and against accusing President Putin of genocide. Russia is keeping up its assault on one of its key targets, the southern port city of Mariupol. If captured, it would be only the second major city after Kherson to fall since the war began, and pave the way for a broader Russian campaign in the east. The human cost has been immense: Mariupol's mayor says as many as 21,000 civilians have been killed in the southern city and 100,000 are still awaiting evacuation. Meanwhile, Ukraine has denied Russian reports of more than 1,000 marines surrendering in the city. One of them - a British man - told family there were no weapons left to fight. For a full picture of the fighting on the ground, our Visual Journalism team have been tracking the conflict in maps. When the Russians retreated from Bucha, one of several towns they occupied north of the capital Kyiv, a massive operation began to find and document the dead. One of the bodies belonged to Vitaliy, a former cook who moved to Bucha two years ago. ""He was living a peaceful life here,"" his brother Serhiy said. ""He was a normal guy, that's all, a kind-hearted man. He gave his all."" At least 500 dead have been found since the Russians left. The BBC's Joel Gunter joined the local police officers and bereaved families as they carried out their grim task. One of Russia's main concerns has been the prospect of Ukraine joining Nato, but a consequence of the conflict may be that the bloc gains two new members anyway. Finnish Prime Minister Sanna Marin says her country will decide whether to apply to join Nato ""within weeks"". She was speaking at a news conference alongside her Swedish counterpart - Sweden too is considering membership. As our Diplomatic Correspondent James Landale notes, Russia's invasion of Ukraine is transforming European security. Viktor Medvedchuk is a wealthy businessman who is close to Russia's President Vladimir Putin. So close, in fact, that his daughter has President Putin as a godfather. For years Ukraine tolerated him as a useful channel to the Kremlin. But last year, he was charged with treason and soon after Russia's invasion he escaped house arrest. Ukraine has now recaptured him. On Wednesday security chief Ivan Bakanov gave more details of the operation. He said Ukrainian agents thwarted a plot by Russia's Federal Security Service to smuggle him across the border into Moldova, and then on to Moscow. "
677,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-61017352,2022-04-13T19:44:34,Ukraine war: Is Russia committing genocide?," Atrocities committed by Russian forces in Ukraine have sparked widespread accusations of war crimes - with some voices arguing that Moscow has gone even further. ""That is real genocide, what you have seen here,"" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said from Bucha, where at least 500 people have been found dead since the Russians left. Poland's Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki agrees that the killings in Bucha and other towns near the capital Kyiv ""must be called acts of genocide and be dealt with as such"". UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said attacks on civilians in Bucha do not ""look far short of genocide"". Now US President Joe Biden has accused Russian forces of committing acts of ""genocide"" in Ukraine. He said Russian President Vladimir Putin was trying to ""wipe out the idea"" of a Ukrainian identity. But many countries have stopped short of using the word to describe what's happening in Ukraine. French President Emmanuel Macron says he is reluctant to use the term and warned against an ""escalation of rhetoric"". So is there a case for accusing Russian forces of committing what has been called the ""crime of all crimes""? Genocide is widely seen as the most serious crime against humanity. It is defined as a mass extermination of a particular group of people - for example, the murder of six million Jews in the Holocaust of World War Two. The UN Genocide Convention defines genocide as committing any of the following ""with the intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnic, racial or religious group"": There is no consensus on this. Eugene Finkel, an associate professor of international affairs at Johns Hopkins University, believes genocide is underway in Ukraine. He says there is evidence of killings, carried out in Bucha and other places, of people based on their Ukrainian identity. ""It's not just killing people, it's targeting a national identity group,"" he says. However, it's the rhetoric coming from Moscow that tips over into genocidal intent, Mr Finkel says. He points to an article titled ""What should Russia do with Ukraine?"" published last week by Russia's state-owned media Ria news agency. The article argues that Ukraine ""is impossible as a nation state"" and even its name ""apparently cannot be retained""; the Ukrainian nationalist elite ""need to be liquidated, its re-education is impossible"", argues the article's writer, Timofei Sergeytsev. He bases his theory on the baseless claim that Ukraine is a Nazi state, arguing that a significant section of the population is guilty too because they are ""passive Nazis"", and therefore accomplices. After a Russian victory these people would require re-education lasting at least a generation and it would ""inevitably mean de-Ukrainisation"". ""For me, the shift in tone in recent weeks in Russia, and especially among the elites, was the tipping point that we call the threshold of intent, not just to destroy the state... but to destroy an identity,"" says Prof Finkel. ""The goal of the war is de-Ukrainisation... they are not focusing on the state, they're focusing on Ukrainians."" Gregory Stanton, founding president and chair of Genocide Watch, says there is proof ""that the Russian army is in fact intending to destroy, in part, the Ukrainian national group"". ""That's why they're targeting civilians. They're not just targeting combatants and military."" He says President Putin's claims in the lead-up to the invasion, that the eight-year war in Ukraine's east looked like genocide, were what some scholars call ""mirroring"". ""Often the perpetrator of genocide will accuse the other side - the targeted victims - of intending to commit genocide before, in fact, the perpetrator does so. That's what happened in this case."" But other experts in the field of genocide say it's too early to define Russian atrocities as being in that category. According to Jonathan Leader Maynard, lecturer in international politics at King's College London, says the evidence is still too unclear under the strict wording of the Genocide Convention. That doesn't necessarily mean genocide is not taking place - he says it's ""very clear"" that atrocities are happening - just that the bar has yet to be cleared. ""It's possible that those atrocities could be genocidal or could escalate in future to genocide, but the evidence is not strong enough yet,"" he says. However, he points to the ""deeply troubling"" rhetoric of Russia's president denying Ukraine's historical existence as an independent nation. It illustrates a ""genocidal way of thinking"", he says, where Vladimir Putin believes Ukraine ""isn't real, so they don't have the right to exist"". The risk of genocide is increasing due to that kind of talk, he says, ""but we cannot automatically assume that such rhetoric is going to lead to actions carried out on the ground"". For Philippe Sands, there appears to be evidence of war crimes given the targeting of civilians and the siege of the port city of Mariupol appears to be a crime against humanity. However, Prof Sands, who is director of the Centre for International Courts and Tribunals at University College London, says in order to prove genocide under international law, a prosecutor must establish an intent to destroy a group, in whole or in part. And international courts have set a very high threshold for proving that. Intent can be established by direct evidence where the perpetrators say they are killing people in order to destroy the group. But Prof Sands believes that is unlikely to exist in Ukraine's case. Intent can also be inferred from a pattern of behaviour, ""but that's a tough call"", he adds. Not enough is known yet of the intentions of those Russians alleged to have carried out atrocities. ""Going into a village and executing a significant proportion of adult males from one national or religious group on an apparently systematic basis - if that is what happened in Bucha - could be an indicator of a genocidal intent,"" he says. ""But at this stage we have insufficient evidence to know what precisely happened and why. I think it's right to be extremely alert to signs of genocidal intent, as the war moves to the east of Ukraine and becomes increasingly brutal."" Prof Sands says that the term genocide is often ""being used in a political rather than legal sense"", and that he has ""no objection to President Zelensky and President Biden evoking a possible genocide to garner attention toward the horrors that are being perpetrated"". Alex Hinton, director of the Centre for the Study of Genocide and Human Rights at Rutgers University, says ""a lot has changed in a week"" and that it is ""quite likely"" that Russia is committing genocide in Ukraine. He points to killings and rape as potential evidence. President Putin is displaying genocidal rhetoric, Mr Hinton says, but this will need to be clearly linked to atrocities on the ground to prove genocidal intent. If Ukrainian government reports are confirmed that Ukrainian children are being separated from their parents with a view to having them adopted by Russian families, that would constitute a genocidal act, he says. Whether or not Russia is committing genocide should not cloud what Alex Hinton sees as clear atrocities being committed by Russian forces in Ukraine. ""We know atrocity crimes are taking place and that compels action. It shouldn't be a case where we think it has to be genocide to do more."" "

There are concerns that refugees are at risk and could be exploited if matched with an unsuitable host via the Homes for Ukraine sponsorship scheme. The UNHCR has called for ""a more appropriate process"" when matching sponsors and refugees. The government said there were ""robust security and background checks"". The Homes for Ukraine scheme opened on 18 March but has been criticised for being overly bureaucratic and slow to grant visas. Anyone in the UK can apply to become a host on the scheme, as long as they are able to offer accommodation to a refugee for at least six months. However, the government does not match hosts with refugees and reports suggest some people could be using social media to find vulnerable women and children fleeing the war. A spokesman for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees said it would be ""more appropriate"" to match women and women with children with families or couples than with single men. ""Matching done without the appropriate oversight may lead to increasing the risks women may face, in addition to the trauma of displacement, family separation and violence already experienced,"" he added. The warning follows an investigation by the Times that resulted in an undercover journalist posing as a young Ukrainian woman being inundated with inappropriate messages from single men. And Louise Calvey, the head of safeguarding at Refugee Action has previously told the Observer the scheme was at risk of becoming a ""Tinder for sex traffickers"". Members of some Facebook groups have also expressed concerns over exploitation when young Ukrainian women have posted looking for accommodation. A spokesperson for the government said that ""Attempts to exploit vulnerable people are truly despicable - this is why we have designed the Homes for Ukraine scheme to have specific safeguards in place."" They said these included ""robust security and background checks"" on all sponsors, by the Home Office and local authorities. ""Councils must make at least one in-person visit to a sponsor's property and they have a duty to make sure the guest is safe and well once they've arrived,"" the spokesperson added. Home Office figures published on Friday showed only 12,500 visas had been granted under the Homes for Ukraine scheme, and only 1,200 refugees had arrived in the UK under it. In total the government had granted 41,000 visas to Ukrainians fleeing the war. Home Secretary Priti Patel apologised for the ""frustrating"" delays but said new visa schemes took time to set up. "

Flagmakers, based in Chesterfield, Derbyshire, said it had sold nearly 400 Ukraine flags since February as people display them outside their homes, shops and on high streets. And multiple UK flag websites say they are ""constantly selling out"" of them as they are becoming harder to come by. One worker said they were ""constantly making them"" now. A Flagmakers employee said: ""I've been here eight years and never sold a single one before this all started. ""We sold out within days when the war began and now we are constantly making them to order."" Their biggest buyers are councils and hotels, the company added. The Flag Shop, also based in Chesterfield, has also experienced extremely high demand. As well as the standard blue and yellow Ukraine flag, it said they were also manufacturing custom-made ones with messages of support. Simon Lee, 65, a law professor at the Open University, said his home town in Buckinghamshire was filled with Ukrainian flags. ""Our little town of Olney has Ukrainian flags everywhere, including our house and by the church where John Newton wrote 'Amazing Grace' almost 250 years ago,"" he said. ""We are in awe of the amazing grace shown by Ukrainians."" He added he was particularly sympathetic to those who were caught up in war, as he lived in Northern Ireland during the conflict there. Mr Lee has also signed up to the Homes for Ukraine scheme to house refugees. ""It is striking and humbling to see the streets, houses and shops show solidarity with those suffering from Ukraine"", he added. Follow BBC East Midlands on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram.

680,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-61089039,2022-04-13T17:20:20,Ukraine: Fugitive Putin ally Medvedchuk arrested - security service," Ukraine says it has arrested fugitive pro-Russian politician Viktor Medvedchuk, seen as President Vladimir Putin's closest ally in the country. Ukraine's security service SBU said they had foiled an attempt by Russia to get him out of the country. He is suspected by Ukraine of treason. Mr Medvedchuk, 67, denies wrongdoing. In his nightly video address to the nation on Tuesday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky offered to exchange Mr Medvedchuk for Ukrainian captives. But in response, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Mr Medvedchuk was a Ukrainian citizen and denied any covert connection between the politician and Moscow. ""As regards the exchange, which various individuals in Kyiv are talking about with such passion and glee, Medvedchuk is not a citizen of Russia and he has nothing to do with the special military operation. He is a foreign politician,"" Mr Peskov said. He added that Moscow has ""no idea"" whether Mr Medvedchuk himself would want such an exchange. The wealthy businessman leads the pro-Russian Opposition Platform - For Life party in Ukraine, and his daughter has President Putin as a godfather. He had been under house arrest in the capital Kyiv - but escaped soon after Russia invaded Ukraine on 24 February. On Tuesday, the SBU posted a photo purportedly showing Mr Medvedchuk in handcuffs and Ukrainian military fatigues. The security service said in a statement: ""You can be a pro-Russian politician and work for the aggressor state for years. You may have been hiding from justice lately. You can even wear a Ukrainian military uniform for camouflage. ""But will it help you escape punishment? Not at all! Shackles are waiting for you and same goes for traitors to Ukraine like you."" On Wednesday SBU head Ivan Bakanov revealed more details of the operation, saying Mr Medvedchuk was arrested in Kyiv region on his way to the border. Agents of Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB) were waiting for him in Trans-Dniester, a pro-Russian breakaway region of Moldova, from where he was to be taken to Moscow, Mr Bakanov said. ""We were up against not only Mr Medvedchuk,"" he said. ""We were up against a very powerful enemy, the FSB."" The Kremlin spokesman said Russia would keep an eye on what happened to Mr Medvedchuk and encouraged European countries to do so too, Russia's Interfax news agency reported. Meanwhile, Russian politician Dmitry Medvedev, deputy chair of the security council, appeared to threaten reprisals in a post on Telegram. Referring to Ukrainian authorities, he said: ""These people should watch out and lock the doors well at night to make sure they do not become the people who are going to be exchanged themselves."" A wealthy businessman with close ties to the Russian leader, for years he was tolerated in Ukrainian political circles because he was seen as an important channel of communication with the Kremlin. He also played an important role as a go-between with Russian-backed separatists who seized areas of eastern Ukraine. He has regularly been photographed alongside Vladimir Putin - while watching a Formula One race in Sochi, at martial arts meetings and hosting the Russian leader at his villa in Crimea. Russia's president said in 2019 that they met from time to time. ""I would not say that we are very close but we know each other well,"" he told filmmaker Oliver Stone. Mr Medvedchuk has repeatedly described the accusations against him as ""political repression"". He was charged with treason in May 2021 and placed under house arrest. Months later he was also accused of trying to buy coal from mines in areas of Ukraine held by Russian-backed separatists to fund the rebels, which he also denied. When he escaped house arrest in late February his lawyer said he had faced threats to his life and had been evacuated to a safe place in Kyiv. His party, Ukraine's biggest opposition grouping in parliament, was among 11 that were suspended last month on security grounds because of alleged links to Russia. Russia condemned the move as a mistake by President Zelensky that would divide the country. The US slapped sanctions on Mr Medvedchuk in 2014, accusing him of undermining Ukraine's sovereignty. Then this year, the US accused two members of his Opposition Platform party of helping Russia to undermine Ukraine's leadership. One of those MPs was Taras Kozak, who owned three TV channels that Ukrainian officials controversially shut down last year amid allegations that they broadcast Russian disinformation. Mr Medvedchuk was also closely linked to the TV channels - Zika, 112 Ukraine and Newsone. Together, the two men are said to have made millions from buying a 42% stake in a Russian oil refinery in the mining city of Novoshakhtinsk for a knockdown price. Mr Medvedchuk eventually bought a majority stake in the refinery in the name of his wife, TV star Oksana Marchenko, to avoid US sanctions. "
681,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-61092953,2022-04-13T17:17:09,"Ukraine war: Mass surrender of troops in Mariupol, says Russia"," Russia says more than 1,000 Ukrainian marines have surrendered in the besieged port of Mariupol, but Ukraine denies this. The city's Deputy Mayor, Serhiy Orlov, told the BBC that Ukrainian troops there were still fighting. Tens of thousands of people have died in Mariupol, Ukraine says. Fighting appears to be continuing around the giant Azovstal steel works in the port, which is one of two areas not under Russian control. Russian television has broadcast footage which it says shows marines giving themselves up at the steel works. But an adviser to Ukraine's president insisted that the marines had in fact broken through to connect with Azov battalion forces in another pocket. Mariupol is a major port and a key target for Russia as it seeks to establish a land route to the Crimea peninsula, which it annexed in 2014. The city has been the focus of a devastating assault by Russian forces, and Ukrainian troops there have said they are running out of ammunition. A senior US defence official said that Russian air strikes continued to target Mariupol and the US does not believe the city has been fully taken by Russia. Earlier on Wednesday Reuters journalists saw flames billowing from the Azovstal steel works where marines from the 36th brigade have been holed up for weeks. The population of Mariupol stood at over 400,000 before the Russian invasion. Residents unable to escape the siege have struggled to access the basics for survival. "
682,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-61093302,2022-04-13T16:28:40,Ukraine War: Finland to decide on Nato membership in weeks says PM Marin," Finnish Prime Minister Sanna Marin says her country will decide whether to apply to join Nato ""within weeks"". She said she saw no reason to delay the decision, at a joint news conference alongside Sweden's prime minister. Her comments coincided with a report to the Finnish parliament that said membership of the bloc could result in ""increased tensions on the border between Finland and Russia"". Moscow has warned Finland and Sweden against joining Nato in recent weeks. Finland and Sweden are militarily non-aligned but Russia's invasion of Ukraine has prompted increasing public support to become members of the Western defensive alliance. Swedish leader Magdalena Andersson told reporters that the same ""very serious analysis"" was taking place as in Finland and she saw no point in delaying it. Swedish newspaper Svenska Dagbladet reported on Wednesday that Ms Andersson was aiming to apply for membership in time for a Nato summit in late June. Finland shares a 1,340km (830 miles) border with Russia, and Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has stressed that Moscow would have to ""rebalance the situation"" with its own measures if the Nato bid went ahead. ""I won't give any kind of timetable when we will make our decisions, but I think it will happen quite fast,"" said Ms Marin. She pointed out that Nato membership offered Finland the security guarantee of Article Five, whereby an attack on one member is viewed as an attack on all. While the two leaders met in Stockholm, Finland's security review was being launched in Helsinki. Foreign Minister Pekka Haavisto said Russia's war had changed the security environment in Europe and forced the review of Finnish defence policy. Russia's invasion of Ukraine is transforming European security. The Nato military alliance has been given new purpose and now - potentially - could get new members too. Voters in Finland and Sweden have long cherished their non-aligned status. But now the mood is changing. Sanna Marin's predecessor as prime minister, Alexander Stubb, says the decision is a ""foregone conclusion"". Sweden is also looking afresh at Nato - the country's ruling Social Democrat party is reviewing its historic opposition to joining the alliance. But Russian spokesmen have repeatedly said any expansion of Nato would be considered a ""provocation"" and warned there would be ""consequences"". The report warns that ""military force might be used solely against Finland,"" and that the security situation in Europe and Finland is more serious and more difficult to predict than at any time since the Cold War. It also noted that were Finland to join the bloc, it would be forced to spend up to 1.5% more of its budget on defence, but added that membership of the alliance would offer the country a greater capacity to defend itself. Finland has already announced a 40% increase in its defence budget by 2026. Any potential application would also welcome a bid by neighbouring Sweden to seek membership of the bloc, it added. The Finnish government emphasised that the report ""does not include any conclusions or present new security policy guidelines"" and said that no decisions would be made before parliament had debated its findings. Ms Marin told reporters that ""all the parliamentary groups, government and also the president will have the possibility to make the decisions within upcoming weeks"". Defence Minister Antti Kaikkonen said the military situation remained calm but cautioned that the army must be ready for possible changes. The prime minister warned earlier that Finland had to be prepared for a Russian attack during any potential Nato evaluation process. There have been reports that Moscow has started to move military equipment towards the Russian-Finnish border, although US officials said they had seen nothing to confirm that. Finland has maintained a policy of military neutrality designed to avoid confrontation with Russia since Nato was formed in 1949. In 1939, Finland fought off an invasion from the Soviet Union in what became known as the Winter War, but ended up ceding most of its eastern province of Karelia. Ms Marin's ruling Social Democratic party has traditionally supported the policy of non-alignment and she reiterated it as recently as March. But recent opinion polls show that public support for joining Nato has climbed from 28% in February to 62% last month. Finland retains a large standing military of around 21,500 troops and has the capacity to call up over 200,000 reservists in the event of war. "
683,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-61093971,2022-04-13T16:27:01,War in Ukraine: Separatist leaders targeted in new UK sanctions," The self-styled leaders of Ukraine's breakaway regions are among those being targeted by new UK sanctions. Individuals sanctioned include Sergei Kozlov and Alexander Ananchenko, from the self-declared People's Republics of Donetsk and Luhansk in eastern Ukraine. Russia has recently pulled troops away from Kyiv and shifted most of the focus of its war to eastern Ukraine. Last week scores of people were killed in a missile strike on a train station in the eastern city of Kramatorsk. The measures are being co-ordinated with the EU, the Foreign Office said. Announcing the latest sanctions, Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said after the ""horrific rocket attacks on civilians"" the UK was sanctioning those who ""prop up the illegal breakaway regions"" and were ""complicit in atrocities"" against Ukrainians. She vowed ministers would continue to target all those who ""aid and abet"" Russian President Vladimir Putin's invasion. More than 50 people, including children, were killed and many more were injured in Friday's train station attack. Ukrainian officials say thousands of people were waiting for evacuation trains to escape heavy Russian shelling across the wider Donetsk region. The country's president Volodymyr Zelensky blamed Russia for the attack, but Moscow denied carrying it out. Russia is building up troops and military equipment along Ukraine's eastern border ahead of an expected offensive in the Donbas - which broadly refers to the Russian-backed separatist regions of Donetsk and Luhansk. The latest UK sanctions announced on Wednesday target 206 people, including 178 separatists, six oligarchs, their close associates and employees, as well as an additional 22 individuals. Maria Lavrova, the wife of Russia's foreign minister Sergei Lavrov, is among those subject to a travel ban and asset freeze. Further family members of Russian oligarchs have also been targeted, including Pavel Ezubov, cousin of Oleg Deripaska, and Nigina Zairova, the executive assistant to Mikhail Fridman. The Foreign Office said since Russia's invasion of Ukraine on 24 February, the UK had sanctioned more than 1,400 individuals and businesses - including more than 100 oligarchs and family members. The department added that secondary legislation would be also laid in Parliament on Thursday banning the import of Russian steel and iron products and the export of luxury goods. "

He said Russian President Vladimir Putin was trying to ""wipe out the idea"" of a Ukrainian identity. The US has historically been reluctant to use the word genocide due to a duty to intervene if the term is used. French President Emmanuel Macron later said he was reluctant to use the word. The Kremlin called Mr Biden's comments ""unacceptable"". But Mr Biden insisted on Tuesday night that evidence of genocidal acts by Russian troops was mounting. ""More evidence is coming out of the horrible things that the Russians have done in Ukraine,"" the president said. ""And we're going to only learn more and more about the devastation. We'll let the lawyers decide internationally whether or not it qualifies, but it sure seems that way to me."" He first made the comments as part of a throwaway remark during a speech in Iowa about increasing inflation, telling supporters in Iowa their ability to budget should not ""hinge on whether a dictator declares war and commits genocide half a world away"". Speaking to the public broadcaster France 2, the President Macron said he would be ""careful with such terms today because these two peoples are brothers."" ""I want to continue to try, as much as I can, to stop this war and rebuild peace. I am not sure that an escalation of rhetoric serves that cause,"" he added. The Kremlin said Mr Biden was attempting to ""distort the situation"" in Ukraine. ""This is hardly acceptable from a president of the United States, a country that has committed well-known crimes in recent times,"" Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said on a conference call with reporters. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who has not held back from accusing Russia of genocide and crimes against humanity following the discovery of mass graves in the city of Bucha, said Mr Biden's comments were ""true words of a true leader"". ""Calling things by their names is essential to stand up to evil,"" Mr Zelensky wrote on Twitter. Last month, US officials rowed back on comments President Biden made in Warsaw. At the end of a speech in front of Polish government officials and dignitaries he said of Mr Putin: ""For God's sake, this man cannot remain in power."" The US quickly issued a clarification amid fierce backlash from the Kremlin. ""The president's point was that Putin cannot be allowed to exercise power over his neighbours or the region,"" a Biden administration official said. ""He was not discussing Putin's power in Russia, or regime change."" Genocide is widely seen as the most serious crime against humanity and is defined under international law as a mass extermination of a particular group of people. While there is no legal consensus on whether Russia is guilty of the crime, Poland's Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki has described killings in the town of Bucha as ""acts of genocide"". And last week, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the attacks do not ""look far short of genocide"". The US has historically dodged using the word genocide when defining atrocities. The UN Genocide Convention, of which the US is a signatory, requires countries to intervene once genocide is formally identified. Former President Bill Clinton was heavily criticised for failing to use the term as Rwandan Hutus' were killing ethnic Tutsis in 1994. His administration eventually used the diluted term ""acts of genocide"". The Biden administration last month declared that Myanmar's military committed genocide against the Rohingya minority. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said that it was only the eighth time in history that the US had determined a genocide had taken place. "

686,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-61085810,2022-04-13T14:14:09,Collecting the dead in Bucha," When the Russians retreated from Bucha, a massive operation began to find and document the dead. BBC News joined the local police officers and bereaved families as they carried out their grim task. Warning: This article contains graphic images. Police Chief Vitaliy Lobas was sitting at a child's desk in an abandoned school in Bucha, collecting the details of the bodies. Every few minutes, Chief Lobas, who has broad shoulders and short dark hair, and rarely uses an unnecessary word, received a call on his mobile phone, and the brief conversations went the same: a location, a few details, a phone number of a relative or friend. Before the Russians came, Lobas was an ordinary local police chief, the head of Buchanksy District 1, who spent his days dealing with ordinary local crime and the occasional murder. Since the liberation of Bucha, he has spent his days in this abandoned school classroom, where school posters still hang on the walls, coordinating the massive operation to find the dead. In front of Lobas on the school desk there was a map of Bucha, a once peaceful and little-known suburb of Kyiv that is now a sprawling crime scene. The area was occupied by Russian forces for a month as they attempted to assault Kyiv, and its liberation a little over a week ago has begun a slow and painful process of uncovering horrors. Each time the phone rang, Lobas consulted the map in front of him, and on a plain piece of paper he wrote down the necessary information in neat handwriting, one line per body. By mid-morning, he had filled one side of A4 and moved on to the reverse. The previous day there had been 64 bodies, he said. The day before, 37. He did not know how many there would be that day, but he was expecting the number to jump by around 40 because a mass grave was being dug up nearby. Lobas is only in charge of one part of this region, and many more bodies are being found outside his jurisdiction. Lobas paused occasionally to go to the school playground for a cigarette, but even these moments were interrupted by calls about bodies or problems relating to the collection of bodies. It was raining in Bucha, and one of the vans that ferried corpses to the morgue had become stuck in the mud. A tractor needed to be found quickly, because there was a limited number of vans and a large number of bodies. Lobas generally delegates the field work to his deputies, but in cases of particularly grave crimes he goes himself. ""When people have been shot in the head with their hands tied behind their back, for example, I will go,"" he said. ""When the bodies have been burned I also go."" About mid-morning, a call came in from Dmytro Kushnir, a 24-year-old police deputy in one of Lobas's units, to log a body that had been reported behind an apartment building on the outskirts of Bucha. When Kushnir arrived at the building, which stood alone on an otherwise undeveloped green area on the edge of woodland, he found two men behind the building at the place where the property line met the woods. They were wearing blue surgical gloves and standing over the partially decomposed body of a man who appeared to have been shot in the back of the head. The body lay on a stained white duvet decorated with red flowers and was surrounded by empty bottles of beer and spirits. The blue surgical gloves initially gave the men the appearance of medical officials, but they introduced themselves as Volodymyr and Serhiy Brezhnev, the dead man's father and brother. Lying on the blanket was Vitaliy Brezhnev, a 30-year-old former cook who, until the Russians arrived, lived a peaceful life with his girlfriend on the sixth floor of the apartment building that now towered over his corpse. Volodymyr and Serhiy had lost contact with Vitaliy a month earlier, when the Russians seized control of Bucha and communications went down. It was impossible to enter the suburb to check his building, so they searched for him for a month online, scouring social media in vain for evidence that he was alive. When the Russians finally retreated, a little over a week ago, Serhiy got a call from Vitaliy's girlfriend and she told them the story. The Russians had assaulted the apartment building and blasted their way into every apartment with a shotgun, she said, demanding people handed over their SIM cards and keys. They interrogated her and Vitaliy in separate rooms, beat them, and shot their dog, she said. Then they took her down to the basement with a group of other residents and bolted the door, but took Vitaliy away separately and told her she wouldn't see him again, and she didn't. As soon as the Ukrainian army declared Bucha safe to re-enter, Volodymyr and Serhiy set out for the apartment building. Inside, they found blood smeared on the floor in the stairwells and personal photographs from people's apartments strewn around. On every door you could see the holes from the shotgun blasts - sometimes one, sometimes four or five. Doors with steel plates had been crowbarred. On one wooden door, where the lock hadn't given way to repeated shots, the Russian soldiers appeared to have become frustrated and blown a hole right through the middle of the door into the apartment. Behind another door, it was clear the homeowners had pushed a heavy table up against the frame in a failed attempt to keep the invaders out. When Volodymyr and Serhiy reached the sixth floor they saw that the shotgun had been used on the door of Apartment 83. A rank odour came from inside. The Russians had trashed the apartment and pried open the air vents and even the bathroom drain, looking for money, Serhiy guessed. When he entered Vitaliy's bedroom he suffered the first of several blows to his hopes of finding his brother alive. On the pillow there was a deep blood stain and blood was sprayed up the walls behind the bed. Among the mess on the floor there were two 7.62mm bullet casings - the calibre used by the Russian army in their rifles. ""You could see that a man had been killed here,"" Serhiy said. ""But there was no body."" So Volodymyr and Serhiy began to search for Vitaliy, knowing that their search was now probably for a body and not a son and brother they could hold again in their arms. Serhiy was carrying a passport photograph of Vitaliy. ""We searched and searched,"" he said, ""and at first we were looking for his face."" Warning: Readers may find some of the following images distressing Behind the building, next to the woods, they found what appeared to be a shallow grave, and they began to dig. It took time to exhume the remains there. First they saw a flower-patterned duvet they didn't recognise and their hearts found some hope. But when they brought the body up they saw that inside the duvet there was a curtain from Vitaliy's apartment. Then they saw the dead man's shoes and thought they recognised them. The light was fading by that point and they had to be home before curfew, so they covered the body with the sheet. Embers of hope remained. ""Today was the final touch,"" Serhiy said, the following day, looking down at the body. ""Today we took his shoes off and we saw his feet."" Because Vitaliy's feet had been inside socks and shoes they were better preserved than the rest of his body after a month in the earth. ""We saw the shape of his feet,"" Volodymyr said. ""Then we looked at the shape of the nose and the hands,"" Serhiy said. ""And we knew it was our bloodline."" Volodymyr had purchased the small apartment in Bucha two years earlier - an investment in his son's future. Vitaliy had been a cook in a restaurant in Kyiv, until the pandemic hit and he was laid off. He did some work in construction and was looking for something more stable, but he had a girlfriend he loved and a dog, and now an apartment in a nice neighbourhood. He loved to fish and hunt, and forage for mushrooms in his spare time, and cook. ""He was living a peaceful life here,"" Serhiy said. ""He was a normal guy, that's all, a kind-hearted man. He gave his all."" ""He was a son and a brother,"" Volodymyr said, trying to hold back his tears. At the front of the apartment building, Officer Kushnir was filling out his police report. Volodymyr went to his car and took two small pieces of cardboard and wrote his name and phone number and Vitaliy's name and address on each. Then he asked some neighbours for clear tape to cover the ink, because the rain was beginning to fall harder on Bucha, and he went back to the body, without surgical gloves this time, to tie one piece of card to Vitaliy's ankle and one to his wrist. ""I do not want to lose my son,"" he said. Officer Kushnir finished his report and called it in. Chief Lobas would arrange for the van that collected the bodies to stop by. Volodymyr and Serhiy took shelter from the rain and waited for the van to arrive. As the day wore on, Chief Lobas's classroom command post got busier. Officers came and went, filing crime scene reports. The list on Lobas's desk got longer and his phone kept ringing. A dead woman had been found in a well next to a destroyed column of Russian tanks. There was a body on the ninth floor of an apartment building. A driver of one of the vans called to say he couldn't find the body he had been sent to collect. A woman came in to the classroom in person to report that her neighbour was dead. ""I understand everything,"" Lobas told her, keen to move on. ""We will try to collect him today."" Lobas's father called. ""Dad, I am too busy,"" he said. ""Everything is OK."" Two of Bucha district's police departments had been destroyed in the Russian assault and Lobas was struggling for resources. There were not enough body bags. His team had also been whittled down over the preceding days to those who had shown themselves capable of withstanding this new work. ""Those who were weak went at the very beginning,"" he said. There was little room for sentiment amid the scale of the task. Lobas received another call. ""Nine?"" he said. ""Where?"" The call was coming from a unit in a neighbouring police department. Nine bodies were buried in a field nearby. Lobas hung up and dialled one of his mobile units. ""The team there is exhausted and they have no body bags left,"" he said. ""They have been collecting bodies all day. Please go and help them now. Find body bags and help them to pack the bodies."" The nine graves were laid out neatly in a row at the edge of the field, behind a corrugated fence at the end of a dirt track. The dead had been buried by their neighbours during the Russian occupation and now they were being exhumed by their neighbours, with the help of the police. ""Some of these people died because they could not get medicine and some were killed by Russians,"" said Gennadiy, a 45-year-old Ukrainian from one of the buildings by the field, who had helped to bury the the bodies and was doing the most work now to bring them up. ""These were our neighbours,"" Gennadiy said, a look of deep anger set in his face. ""Here is Uncle Tolya from the building next door and a neighbour of his. Here is another person I knew from the next building. This man has a bullet wound, we didn't know him but we found a passport on his body. This elderly woman had severe diabetes and we tried to take her out of Bucha but there was no green corridor, so she died. This man went for a walk with his dog and didn't come back. We are not pathologists but it looks like he was shot."" The work to remove the bodies was hard. They had been buried well in deep graves, and the rain was soaking into the mud and making it slippery. Gennadiy, in a green plastic rain cape, climbed into each grave, one after the other, and shovelled the earth from around the bodies so that thick straps could be tied around them to hoist them up. Each body had been wrapped in whatever was at hand - curtains, blankets of different colours and patterns. They were examined by the police and any obvious wounds photographed with an iPhone. Enough body bags had been found, and after a while the van arrived. In the dirt on its back doors, someone had scrawled '200' - the military identifier for the transport of the dead. The bodies were loaded inside. The sky was grey and the rain kept falling. At Vitaliy's apartment building, Volodymyr and Serhiy had waited as long as they could for the van to arrive. It was getting dark and they needed to get home. Vitaliy's body would have to spend another night on the ground. They were too late now to make the 9pm curfew in Kyiv, but at the military checkpoints along the route they showed the death report and were waved through. At sunrise the next morning, the father and son got up and began the drive back to Bucha. They could not wait for the van any longer, and they loaded Vitaliy's body into the back of their car and set out for a morgue in the town of Boyarka, about an hour's drive south. Before the invasion, the staff at the Boyarka morgue were used to handling about three bodies a day, the vast majority of them deaths from natural causes. Since Bucha was liberated, they have been autopsying about 50 bodies a day, 80% of which were violent deaths, said Semen Petrovych, 39, who has been the forensic expert there for 16 years. The morgue, a small outbuilding at the back of a hospital on the edge of town, where Boyarka meets the forest, had just acquired two rented refrigerator trucks and both were full of bodies. Body bags lay on the floor by the trucks and against the fence nearby and either side of the entrance to the morgue. ""There are not enough staff and there is not enough room,"" said Petrovych, the forensic expert. ""Even if we had more people, where would we put the bodies?"" Normally he would do a careful autopsy on every body and print a death certificate. ""Now we just dissect them quickly and write something simple by hand,"" he said. Volodymyr and Serhiy were not alone in bringing a body themselves. Private cars pulled up to the morgue and bodies were brought out wrapped in blankets and rugs. Relatives and friends came searching. Tatiana Zhylenko was looking for the body of the father of a friend who was abroad. ""He had his passport on his chest,"" she told the staff. Oleksander Zakovorotnyi came for his father-in-law, who, when the Russians cut the gas supply in the depth of winter, rigged up a makeshift heater using a gas cylinder, but fell asleep and was poisoned when the flame went out. Volodymyr and Serhiy waited outside until they were called in to identify Vitaliy. They stood inside the cramped, low-ceilinged morgue, where there were bodies on the floor and on every gurney and the smell was overpowering. They had to squeeze between two gurneys, beside an open corpse, to get close to Vitaliy's body, and they searched it for scars they could remember. They repeated to the pathologist that they thought they recognised his feet. Volodymyr looked away and looked back. He was wrestling with doubt and hope. Afterwards, he walked behind the refrigerator truck and stood alone sobbing, his chest heaving with his tears. Vitaliy was brought out, his body bag tagged number 552 - the 552nd body processed by this small morgue since the beginning of the year, nearly double the figure in a normal year, the extra hundreds all condensed into one week. The police took fingerprints and told Volodymyr and Serhiy that the formal identification would take around a month, because of the backlog, but otherwise they were free to take him to the cemetery to be buried. Rather than wait for the body van, Volodymyr and Serhiy lifted Vitaliy carefully again into the back of their car and drove him the hour or so back to Bucha, past the rows of destroyed homes and places where bodies had laid in the streets for weeks. At the cemetery, which was already full, new graves were being dug outside the boundary fence on a thin strip of earth along the side of the road. A priest intoned the funeral rites over a coffin. The mother of the dead man wailed. In the near distance, past the line of the forest, enormous booms sounded as unexploded ordnance was detonated. Volodymyr and Serhiy drove into the cemetery and unloaded Vitaliy next to a long line of body bags arrayed on the ground. Because Vitaliy had already been identified and would be buried here in Bucha, he was placed into a simple wooden casket with maroon fabric and afforded the small dignity of resting inside a brick building on the cemetery grounds. He would be buried in two days' time. Volodymyr and Serhiy left the cemetery and Volodymyr decided that, even though it was far from their home in Kyiv, he would buy a plot there for his wife Lily, Vitaliy's mother, who was suffering from end-stage cancer, so that when the time came she would be near to her son. Two days later, on a bright, cold morning in Bucha, the family gathered at the cemetery. Once again, Volodymyr and Serhiy took the lead and went inside the brick building to prepare to carry the casket. Lily sat outside on a bench, smoking a cigarette, alone among the body bags. The casket was carried to a stone plinth and the family gathered around it while the priest read the funeral rites and two elderly women from the church held the incense burner and sang. Then Vitaliy was taken by the van marked 200 to one of the fresh graves along the roadside outside the cemetery and laid to rest. Volodymyr was still wrestling with doubt. ""I am still hoping that the fingerprints will show this was not my son,"" he said. Later that day, back at the abandoned school in Bucha, Chief Lobas was sitting at his schooldesk, listening carefully to a man who had come in person to ask for help finding a relative he heard was in a mass grave. The man had been to the large mass grave by the church, he said, but they redirected him to the police. He wanted to give Chief Lobas a picture, but Lobas explained that this was not the way things were done. ""We cannot go around opening all the body bags holding this picture,"" he said. ""Do you understand? It will waste too much time."" Lobas explained that they had to begin burying the unidentified bodies because there was not enough space at the morgues. But he assured the man that fingerprints and photographs were being taken and would be kept. ""Even though the people themselves are buried the information remains,"" he said. ""The photographs remain."" The calls kept coming in - a body on Yablunska Street, another body next to a school. ""We have cleared these two addresses already, give us more to collect,"" Lobas said. He saw a window for a cigarette and went to the playground. The number of bodies each day was already beginning to fall, and he thought the job might be finished soon. ""There are no weekends here now, we will keep working until the collection of the bodies is complete,"" he said. He flicked his cigarette away. His phone was ringing.

Aiden Aslin, from Newark in Nottinghamshire, has been fighting in Ukraine since he moved there in 2018, and became a marine in the country's military. His unit has recently been defending the besieged city of Mariupol, which has been heavily bombarded by Russia. His mother Ang Wood said her son told her he had no choice. ""He called me and said they have no weapons left to fight,"" she told the BBC. ""I love my son, he is my hero - they put up one hell of a fight."" Mr Aslin is a former care worker who previously fought with Kurdish armed units in Syria against so-called Islamic State. He has a Ukrainian fiancée and now has dual citizenship. Ms Wood said her son ""sounded OK"" when she spoke to him, but called for the UK government to provide more support to Ukraine. ""Boris [Johnson] needs to take [Vladimir] Putin down,"" she added. Brennan Philips, a friend of Mr Aslin who also spoke to him by phone, said he sounded ""strong and in good spirits"". ""He called me and said 'we have no food, no supplies, no ammo, we're completely surrounded, we have to surrender',"" he said. ""Aiden was very well aware of what was going on, very calm. ""They can't get out, they can't fight back so they had no choice. ""I'm sure if they had a bullet left they would have shot it."" By Emma Vardy, BBC News correspondent Aiden had been due to get married last week to his Ukrainian fiancée. But his unit had become increasingly cut off as Russian forces bombarded the city of Mariupol in recent weeks, and Aiden's family and loved ones have had an extremely anxious wait as the situation deteriorated. Aiden had been in communication periodically, sometimes sending video updates of himself to friends to post on social media, or just checking in to let his family know he was safe. But the news that he was having to surrender has been a huge blow. There are now Russian reports coming out claiming the 36th Marine Brigade have surrendered, which Aiden's family understand is his unit, though his family have heard nothing further since his initial phone calls. Aiden is no newcomer to the perils of conflict. Before joining the Ukrainian forces, he had previously left the UK to fight in Syria against IS, fighting with the Kurdish armed group the YPG. To the Kurds he is a hero, although he and many others like him faced questioning by counter-terrorism police when they returned to the UK. Most cases were eventually dropped. Now what has happened to him in Ukraine is uncertain. When Aiden spoke to his family it appeared his unit were communicating with the Russians in what appeared to be preparation for a negotiated surrender. The key question is what would happen if he were to be taken as a prisoner of war? His friends have appealed on social media for Aiden and his unit to be treated in accordance with the Geneva conventions. The UK's Foreign Office is working to verify reports of UK nationals like Aiden involved in the fighting. But given the situation, it is likely that the Foreign Office's powers will be quite limited. Russia has claimed more than 1,000 Ukrainian soldiers have surrendered in Mariupol but Ukraine says the city is still standing despite being under siege. Mariupol's mayor said about 21,000 civilians had been killed with another 100,000 awaiting evacuation. The city's fate is likely to be critical for the next phase of the war. In Russian hands, it would provide control of a clear swathe of territory connecting Moscow's two fronts in the south and east. Additional reporting by Liam Barnes.

Cambridge University student Nikolai Nizalov, 19, whose parents are Ukrainian, has joined the front line as a medic based in Lviv. Mr Nizalov was in his first year studying natural sciences but will now help treat injured fighters. The undergraduate said he hoped to continue his studies while in Ukraine. He has no military background and is presently working with a small volunteer combat drone team. ""The drones that we operate can lift up to 15kg (33lb) and deliver supplies up to 20km (12 miles) away,"" he said. ""Stuff like donor blood and medication. We can deliver it to cities that currently we have no established humanitarian corridors to, such as Mariupol."" ""I am their medic and so in this group of nine, if something happens, I'm responsible for getting them out and evacuating them into a safe zone. ""But also I am a drone pilot."" The student said of his decision to join the fight: ""I had that conversation with myself weeks before the war started because it's kind of obvious when 180,000 troops are building up on the border to your country. ""And they're building military hospitals and stocking up on blood supplies, you kind of know what is going to happen."" Mr Nizalov said it had been a tough few weeks in Ukraine. ""I haven't had time to rest yet. In the last 48 days I think I've had one day off,"" he said. ""Of course it is horrific. It's not even a war at this point, it's a genocide, they're trying to wipe out a beautiful culture that is Ukraine."" He said his family were not keen when he announced his plans. ""Obviously they didn't want me to go. It is a war, it is dangerous and I am their son. But they did understand why I made my decision."" He said his ties to the culture prompted him to fight.

Leah Godsell-Fletcher's family is one of the first households in the East Midlands to welcome people under the Homes for Ukraine scheme. Olha Havrilyk, who arrived with her two daughters, said they had seen rockets explode in their neighbourhood. Ms Godsell-Fletcher has said they all feel like ""one extended family"" and communicate through Google Translate. ""It isn't perfect but it's been a lifesaver to get our sense of humour,"" she said. Ms Havrilyk said she had to leave behind her husband, a dental surgeon, in their home in central Ukraine, as he had been conscripted. She said he was very worried but felt calmer that she and her daughters Kateryna, 16, and Dasha, 11, were now safe. Ms Godsell-Fletcher said when they arrived at the home in Wollaton she shares with her husband Mark and young daughter, ""it was very emotional"". ""They were very happy to be here but obviously very emotional, quite scared coming into somebody else's house they don't know,"" she said. ""It just feels like we're one extended family now."" Many other families who have applied under the same scheme are still waiting for visas to be approved. Ms Godsell-Fletcher added: ""My advice would be to think about it very carefully because it is strange having people come into your home. ""The best thing about it is feeling like we're actually doing something to help the Ukrainian people who are really in need. ""I would like to think if it was me and my daughter, someone would do the same for us."" Follow BBC East Midlands on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram. Send your story ideas to eastmidsnews@bbc.co.uk.

Officially, Ukraine's armed forces say they are sustaining its defence and are in ""continuous contact"" with their troops on the ground. But they concede it is likely Moscow will try to take full control of the city, while a regional Russian-backed separatist leader claims Mariupol is close to falling. Ukrainian troops have said they are running out of ammunition, and are believed to have been pushed back into two isolated pockets adjoining the coastline. The city's fate is likely to be critical for the next phase of the war. In Russian hands it would provide control of a clear swathe of territory connecting Moscow's two fronts in the south and east. It would release large numbers of forces to redeploy, and provide President Vladimir Putin with a moment of strategic ""victory"" after a lethally shambolic first stage to his invasion. It would mark a huge loss, if by now an expected one, for Ukraine's leadership which has described Mariupol as ""the heart of this war today"". Russian troops started their encirclement of Mariupol in early March. The siege has killed thousands of civilians and unleashed an appalling struggle for survival for trapped residents who remain. Thousands of people have escaped further north, risking a deadly journey through the front line. Here, in Zaporizhzhia, I have watched civilians arrive day after day, describing how they have witnessed the obliteration of their city. In recent days Russian forces are thought to have pushed in further by dividing the remaining holdout of Mariupol's defenders, according to think tank the Institute for the Study of War (ISW). It's believed Ukraine's forces have been forced back to the port area and the Azovstal plant, a massive iron and steel works from where they had launched counter-attacks for weeks. Videos have emerged of fighters apparently from the 36th marine brigade vowing not to surrender their positions. ""We are holding on to every bit of the city wherever possible,"" says one in a video posted to social media channels on Tuesday. ""But the reality is the city is encircled and blocked and there was no re-supply of ammunition or food,"" he adds. Part of the footage shows him alongside several other marines in a room that looks like a basement shelter. One of the men has crutches leaning against his chair. A post on Monday on the brigade's Facebook page described the situation as ""the last battle… It is death for some of us, and captivity for the rest,"" it said, adding they had been ""pushed back"" and ""surrounded"" by Russian troops. Ukrainian analysts differed over whether the post could be relied on as genuine, with some claiming the page had been hacked. But more than 36 hours later the post remained on the site. The siege and a resulting collapse in communications in Mariupol mean it is difficult to independently verify reports about changes on the ground. There is little doubt Ukrainian forces have been desperate for new supplies of weapons, ammunition, food and water. Ukraine's military reportedly managed over the weeks to resupply troops with kit including night and thermal vision goggles, portable battery charging packs and even anti-tank munitions; but it became increasingly hard. ""Ultimately, the city was surrounded so soon into the invasion that there was never a chance to build up supplies,"" says Justin Bronk, a senior research fellow at defence think tank the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI). ""They've already held out far, far longer than any external analysis would have predicted possible. So it's difficult to say how much longer they can go on,"" he says, adding that they have ""achieved extraordinary results with very little"". Ukrainian attempts to rotate forces or evacuate the wounded also became much more high risk as Russia tightened its siege. The Russian defence ministry claimed two weeks ago it had shot down a Ukrainian Mi-8 helicopter 5km (three miles) from the Sea of Azov shore. It was thought to have been coming out of the city. On Tuesday, it claimed up to 100 Ukrainian troops had tried to fight their way out of the steel works plant - but said half were killed by Russian artillery and airstrikes, and more than 40 surrendered. In his video address to the nation late on Tuesday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said: ""The future of Ukraine directly depends on the strength of our resistance in all its forms. The future of us all, each of our cities, each of our villages. ""And I am grateful to everyone who understands this. Who does not stop resisting even when it seems that the result is very far. Because the darkest time is always before dawn. ""I want to separately address those heroes who are having a very hard time. Those who defend Mariupol. A marine battalion of the 36th marine brigade, Azov special operations detachment, 12th operational brigade of the National Guard of Ukraine. Subdivisions of the State Border Guard Service. Volunteers of the ""Right Sector"". The 555th military hospital and National Police employees."" As well as the marines, the defence of Mariupol also consists of the Azov battalion, an ultranationalist militia formed in 2014 which Kyiv says has been reformed and is now part of Ukraine's National Guard. They are only a tiny part of Ukraine's overall forces, but their presence has been a key focus of Moscow's propaganda war: it refers to the invasion as a ""special military operation"" claiming it is to ""demilitarise"" and ""denazify"" Ukraine. Meanwhile, reports by local forces that Russia deployed chemical weapons in Mariupol this week have yet to be confirmed. They are a reminder of how the conflict could quickly trigger a further dangerous escalation. The full capture of the city could see significant numbers of Russian troops, so far used to contain and prevent resupply in Mariupol, reconstituted and moved elsewhere, particularly in other parts of the eastern Donbas region, where Moscow is gearing up for a major offensive. It could also see Moscow consolidate its progress north of Mariupol, which is one of the reasons the Ukrainians were finding it so hard to relieve the city, according to Mr Bronk. The forces could also be used to bolster Russian-occupied Kherson, where Ukrainian troops have been attempting to retake ground with some success. President Zelensky continued his metaphor that Mariupol is the heart of the war. ""If it stops beating then we will be… weaker,"" he said. "
695,https://www.bbc.com/news/61079356,2022-04-13T02:28:46,Ukraine war: What weapon killed 50 people in station attack?," A BBC investigation has found clear evidence that a cluster bomb, banned by many countries under international law, was used in an attack on Kramatorsk railway station in Ukraine. These weapons deliver a payload of bomblets that spread out and explode over a wide area. More than 50 people died when the missile struck the station, which was crowded with people trying to leave the east of the country, on 9 April. More than 120 countries have agreed to a treaty prohibiting the use of these weapons - but not Russia or Ukraine. BBC journalists who visited the station after the attack found clear patterns on the ground consistent with the use of a cluster-munitions warhead. The resulting multiple explosions typically scatter fragments around the site of the main impact of the missile, leaving tell-tale pockmark indentations where each one makes an impact. A building near the station also showed such a scatter pattern along the side, near a bigger hole created in the wall. Washington Post reporters, who were on the scene very soon after the strike, were told by witnesses that they had heard ""an initial explosion followed by four to five blasts"". This sound pattern is consistent with that of a cluster bomb. Remains of a Soviet-era Tochka-U missile were found in the aftermath of the attack. It's a short-range single warhead ballistic missile that can be fitted with a cluster warhead that carries 50 bomblets, which can detonate upon impact. There is evidence that Russia has previously deployed these missiles in the current conflict, although Ukraine also has this weapon in its arsenal. Russia previously denied using it in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions of Ukraine, but these claims are disputed. Sidharth Kaushal, a missile expert at the Royal United Services Institute (Rusi), said: ""The impact mark is pretty consistent with a sub-munition like the 9N24, a Soviet-era cluster munition that can be carried by the Tochka missile."" He pointed to the fairly shallow central crater and the radiating fragmentation marks that appear to be in one direction, which is consistent with sub-munitions of that shape. ""This is very consistent with the impact point of a fragmentation sub-munition - so a cluster bomb was used."" We've spoken to two other experts who agree with these findings. The BBC has tried to identify the launch site for the missile, using social media video and images, but has so far been unable to do so. The use of these weapons has drawn widespread criticism from human-rights groups due to the damage they cause and the specific harm they pose to civilians in conflict zones. These weapons can release as many as 50 bomblets in a radius up to 400m, with the potential to lead to high civilian casualties in heavily populated areas. There is also the risk they pose when some of the sub-munitions don't detonate, which is common with old Soviet missiles that are decades out of date, as the Tochka is. The 2008 Convention on Cluster Munitions prohibits the use of these weapons, but Russia and Ukraine are not signatories to the treaty. Earlier in the conflict, there were accusations that Russian forces were using cluster munitions in the Kharkhiv area, leading the International Criminal Court (ICC) to announce it was opening an investigation.

696,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-61055319,2022-04-13T01:08:45,How facial recognition is identifying the dead in Ukraine," Last month a controversial facial recognition company, Clearview AI, announced it had given its technology to the Ukrainian government. The BBC has been given evidence of how it is being used - in more than a thousand cases - to identify both the living and the dead. This story contains graphic descriptions that may be upsetting to some readers. A man lies motionless on the floor, his head tilted down. His body is naked, apart from a pair of Calvin Klein boxers. His eyes are ringed with what look like bruises. The body was found in Kharkiv, eastern Ukraine - in the wreckage of war. The BBC has seen pictures taken at the scene, but does not know the circumstances around his death. There is clear evidence of head trauma. He also had a tattoo on his left shoulder. Ukrainian authorities didn't know who the man was, so decided to turn to a cutting edge method: facial recognition using artificial intelligence. Clearview is perhaps the most famous, and controversial, facial recognition system in the world. The company has scraped billions of photos from social media companies, like Facebook and Twitter, to create an enormous database of what its CEO and founder Hoan Ton-That calls ""a search engine for faces"". ""It kind of works like Google. But instead of putting in a string of words or text, the user puts in a photo of a face,"" explains Mr Ton-That. The company has faced a string of legal challenges. Facebook, YouTube, Google and Twitter have sent cease-and-desist letters to Clearview - to ask them to stop using pictures from the sites. The UK's Information Commissioner's Office even fined the company for failing to inform people it was collecting photos of them. Now, its use by the Ukrainian government has raised questions over the implications of infusing this powerful technology into an active war. Clearview is used extensively - though divisively - by law enforcement in America. Ton-That says 3,200 government agencies have either bought or trialled the technology. After Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine, Clearview's founder saw another application for the technology. ""We saw images of people who were prisoners of war and fleeing situations, and you know, it got us thinking that this could potentially be a technology that could be useful for identification, and also verification,"" he says. He quickly offered the Ukrainian government the technology - an offer that was accepted. Back in Kharkiv, authorities took a picture of the dead man's face - his head held up, his sunken eyes directed towards the camera. They snapped a picture, and ran it through Clearview's database. The search returned several pictures of someone who looked very similar to the dead man. One picture had been taken on what looks like a hot day. The man was shirtless. He had a tattoo on his left shoulder. The design matched. They had a name. Using facial recognition to identify the dead is not new, and Clearview isn't the only platform being used to do it in Ukraine. ""We've been using this stuff for years now"" says Aric Toler, research director at Bellingcat, an organisation that specialises in investigative journalism. In 2019, Bellingcat used facial recognition technology to help identify a Russian man who had filmed the torture and killing of a prisoner in Syria. This is not facial recognition's first war. But its use in Ukraine is more wide-ranging than in any previous conflict. Mr Toler says that he uses the facial recognition platform FindClone in Russia, and that it's been particularly helpful for identifying dead Russian soldiers. As with Clearview, FindClone searches through publicly available internet images, including Russian social media pages. Even people who do not have social accounts can be found. ""They might not have a social media profile but their wives or girlfriends might… sometimes they do have profiles and they live in a small town with a big military base. Or they may have a lot of friends who are currently in their unit"", Mr Toler explains, describing FindClone's use as an investigative tool. This last point is fundamental in understanding the power of facial recognition technology. It means that even if a person has never had a social media profile, and thinks they've wiped the internet clean of their image - they can still be found. By appearing in a photo uploaded by a friend or simply by being in the background of a random picture on the internet, they are in the database. It means even military or security personnel, who barely have any presence on the internet, can still be traced. Critics however point out that facial recognition technology is by no means always correct - and that in a time of war, errors could have potentially disastrous consequences. Clearview isn't just being used to identify dead bodies in Ukraine. The company also confirmed it was being used by the Ukrainian government at checkpoints to help identify enemy suspects. Clearview showed the BBC an email, from a Ukrainian agency, confirming that the system was being used to identify the living. ""The system gave us the opportunity to quickly confirm the accuracy of the data of detained suspects"" reads the email, from a Ukrainian official who did not want to be named. ""During the use of Clearview AI, more than 1,000 search queries were performed to conduct the appropriate verification and identification,"" the email reads. This worries some analysts. Conor Healy is a facial recognition expert at IPVM, an organisation that reviews security technology. ""It's important for the Ukrainian forces to recognise that this is not a 100% accurate way of determining whether somebody is your friend or your foe,"" Mr Healy says. ""It shouldn't be a life or death technology where you either pass or fail, where you could get imprisoned or, god forbid, even killed. That's not how this should be used at all."" Others have issued more dire warnings. Albert Fox Cahn, of the watchdog group Surveillance Technology Oversight Project, has called it ""a human rights catastrophe in the making"". ""When facial recognition makes mistakes in peacetime, people are wrongly arrested. When facial recognition makes mistakes in a war zone, innocent people get shot,"" he told Forbes. The BBC contacted the Ukrainian government for comment on its use of Clearview, but did not receive a response. Mr Ton-That has defended the accuracy of Clearview's technology, saying tests had found it to be more than 99% accurate. Much depends though on the quality of the image, the position of the head, or whether the face is covered, for example by a mask. Then there is the issue of privacy, which has been problematic for Clearview in the US and Europe. The company pulls publicly available pictures from firms like Facebook and Instagram to build its database. But it didn't ask social media companies, or anyone in fact, whether it could scrape these pictures. If you are reading this, you are almost certainly in the database, though you likely didn't give Clearview permission to use your image. Last year, Clearview was fined by the UK's Information Commissioner's Office for failing to inform people that it was collecting photos of them from social media platforms. Mr Ton-That accepts there is still debate around the legality of facial recognition technology, but believes Clearview operates within the law - saying the technology has been ""misunderstood"". Facial recognition technology, though, clearly has dystopian applications. In November last year the BBC reported that plans were being drawn up in China to use facial recognition tech to target journalists. Mr Ton-That says Clearview wouldn't allow these kinds of searches, even if they could be used this way. He says Clearview does not work with authoritarian governments and that the company would not work with Russia. There are, however, applications for Clearview's tech in a military context. Last year the company signed a contract with the Pentagon to explore putting its tech into augmented reality glasses for example. It is one of several companies developing facial recognition AI with military contracts. Privacy advocates have another worry too. Facial recognition technology might be useful to the Ukrainian authorities in a time of war. But will they simply hand the technology back to Clearview in a time of peace? ""There are any number of examples of technologies that are introduced in wartime and that persist into peacetime,"" says Mr Healy. ""I hope that that's not the approach they take.""

In a rare public appearance, he said peace talks had reached a dead end and insisted the invasion - which is in its sixth week - was going as planned. A Ukrainian official, however, told Reuters news agency that negotiations were difficult but continuing. Mr Putin's comments were his first on the conflict in more than a week. In contrast to the early days of the war he has more recently kept a lower profile. He was visiting a space facility in eastern Russia with Belarusian leader Aleksandr Lukashenko, one of his closest allies, to mark the 61st anniversary of Yuri Gagarin becoming the first man in space. The Russian leader claimed he had been left with no choice but to launch the invasion in a bid to protect Russian speakers in eastern Ukraine. The Kremlin claims that Ukraine has committed genocide against Russian speakers in eastern Ukraine, but there is no evidence to support this, ""On the one hand, we are helping and saving people, and on the other, we are simply taking measures to ensure the security of Russia itself,"" the 69-year old insisted. ""It's clear that we didn't have a choice. It was the right decision,"" he said, adding that Russia would ""rhythmically and calmly"" continue the invasion. Moscow has shifted its focus to eastern Ukraine, moving troops away from the north after encountering fierce resistance in the initial weeks of what it called its ""special operation"". The UN says 10 million people have fled their homes since the invasion began. Russian presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov admitted last week that the country had suffered ""significant losses of troops"" since the conflict began. Neither Russia nor Ukraine's estimates of Russian losses can be independently verified - and analysts have cautioned that Russia may be downplaying its casualty rate, while Ukraine could be inflating it to boost morale. Western leaders believe that between 7,000 and 15,000 Russian soldiers have been killed. The Russian economy has also been rocked by a package of severe sanctions imposed by Western nations. However, on Tuesday, Mr Putin said Russia did not ""intend to be isolated"", arguing that it was ""impossible to severely isolate anyone in the modern world - especially such a vast country as Russia"". Mr Lukashenko also dismissed the impact of sanctions, asking Mr Putin: ""Why on earth are we getting so worried about these sanctions?"" Last week, the UK government predicted that Russia is heading for its deepest recession since the collapse of the Soviet Union. In other developments: "

On day 48 of the war, he held a press event at a spaceport in Russia's east to say his country would fight on until it achieved its goals. He set out why he believed the invasion was necessary, repeating disproven claims that genocide was taking place against Russian-speakers in Ukraine. The aim, he said, was to ""help people"". ""It's clear that we didn't have a choice. It was the right decision,"" Mr Putin said today about the invasion. ""The goals are perfectly clear, they are noble."" You can read our full story of the event here President Putin's goal now seems to be capturing the eastern Donbas region. Russian military planners are sending forces to the region, where Kyiv says it's preparing for the next stage of the invasion to focus. As hundreds of thousands of civilians escape for safety elsewhere, satellite images show large columns of Russian vehicles heading towards the Donbas in preparation for battle. Fighting in the coming weeks is expected to become even more deadly, as the BBC's Jonathan Beale reports from the ground. President Putin's comments also come as the cost to Russia becomes more and more clear. A row of freshly dug military graves has appeared in recent weeks in Stavropol cemetery in southwestern Russia. All of the soldiers buried here died after 24 February, the date of what President Putin called a ""special military operation"" in Ukraine began. Mourners who are paying tribute to lost ones refuse to believe that accusations of Russian soldiers committing war crimes could be true. ""They'll accuse Russia of anything,"" one grieving widow tells the BBC's Russia Editor Steve Rosenberg. Ukrainian forces in the besieged city of Mariupol allege Russia targeted their soldiers with chemical weapons, but it is still not clear what happened. The US and Britain say they are looking into the reports of a chemical attack. But right now no evidence has been presented to prove if it did take place. Western nations have warned that the use of chemical weapons would mark a dangerous escalation of the conflict and have pledged to take action if Russia carries out such attacks. Our Security Correspondent Frank Gardner has been looking at how we would know chemical weapons have been used. Hackers who could be linked to the Russian military launched a failed cyber-attack against one of Ukraine's largest energy companies. Malicious software targeting an energy sub-station was identified and neutralised, the government in Kyiv says - preventing power from being cut to millions. It's the most serious hacking attempt on Ukraine since the invasion began.. The Ukrainian mother who scrawled contact details on her two-year-old daughter's back while fleeing Kyiv has described her desperation. ""In case of our death, she could be found and would know who she is,"" Sasha Makoviy told The World Tonight on BBC Radio 4. The family, who is now safe, was worried that little Vira could become separated during their escape and would never know who her family was. "

702,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-60708350,2022-04-12T17:10:51,Ukraine conflict: How will we know if Russia used chemical weapons?," Britain has reacted with concern at unconfirmed reports of an alleged chemical attack in the besieged city of Mariupol. The alarm was raised by some of the last Ukrainian soldiers still holding out against the Russian assault there. They are from the Azov Battalion, a small but controversial element of Ukraine's National Guard due to their far right tendencies. They claim that after a Russian drone flew over, there was a cloud of smoke and three of their members experienced breathing difficulties. These could be symptoms consistent with a chemical or poison gas attack but this will be hard to prove. The global watchdog for chemical weapons - the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons - would usually be called in to assess any evidence. But that will be challenging in Mariupol, for obvious reasons. The former British Army officer Hamish de Bretton-Gordon, a chemical weapons expert, cautioned that even if uncontaminated samples could be collected from the scene they would need to be taken to another country for analysis. This, he said, would take some time. Western governments are also able to examine satellite imagery and other intelligence for any signs that chemical weapons units or vehicles were nearby, he said. But that won't give any hard and fast answers any time soon. Britain's Armed Forces Minister James Heappey said the incident needed proper investigation. He said that if Russia were found to have used banned chemical weapons then ""nothing was ruled out"" in terms of Nato's response. So what does that mean exactly? Ministers won't be drawn on the details. Even if it could be proved to be a chemical attack, Nato would still be extremely reluctant to become directly involved in the fighting inside Ukraine's borders. At most it would probably lead to yet more sanctions on Russia and a further stepping up of military hardware exports to Ukraine. Chemical weapons are any kind of munitions that carry toxins or chemical substances that attack the body's system. There are different categories of chemical weapons. Choking agents like phosgene attack the lungs and respiratory system, causing victims to drown in their lungs' secretions. There are blister agents, like mustard gas, which burn the skin and blind people. Then there is the most lethal category of all: nerve agents, which interfere with the brain's messages to the body's muscles. A tiny drop of these can be fatal. Less than 0.5mg of VX nerve agent, for example, is enough to kill an adult. All of these so-called chemical agents can be used in warfare in artillery shells, bombs and missiles. However, all are strictly prohibited by the Chemical Weapons Convention of 1997 which was signed by the vast majority of nations, including Russia. Chemical weapons were used in World War One, in the Iran-Iraq war in the 1980s, and more recently by the Syrian government against rebel forces. Russia says it destroyed the last of its chemical weapons stocks in 2017, but since then there have been at least two chemical attacks blamed on Moscow. The first was the Salisbury attack of March 2018. A former KGB officer and defector, Sergei Skripal, was poisoned along with his daughter by the nerve agent Novichok. Russia denied responsibility and came up with over 20 different explanations for who else could have done it. However, investigators concluded it was the work of two officers from Russia's GRU military intelligence. To show their disgust, countries around the world expelled a total of 128 Russian spies and diplomats. Then, in August 2020, the prominent Russian opposition activist Alexei Navalny was also poisoned with Novichok and narrowly escaped death. Some military analysts fear that if the coming Russian assault in the Donbas fails to achieve its objectives then, in desperation, President Putin could authorise the use of chemical weapons on stubborn defenders. If Russia were to use weapons like poison gas in this war, it would be seen as crossing a major red line, most probably prompting calls for the West to take action. Chemical weapons played a decisive role in the Syrian government's campaign to suppress resistance in rebel-held cities, killing and incapacitating fighters and civilians alike. The Syrian air force, which reportedly carried out dozens of these attacks, was supported and protected by the Russian air force. The general in charge of Russia's war effort there, Aleksandr Dvornikov, has now been appointed to run Moscow's war against Ukraine. The unpleasant truth about chemical weapons is that if you have a protracted war, where the attacking military are trying to break the will of defending forces, then these weapons are one hideously effective way to achieve that. They not only permeate into cellars and bunkers, they can result in an agonising death and hence are also a psychological weapon of terror. "

The fresh mounds of earth are covered in a sea of flowers. Decorating the graves, fluttering in the breeze, are military banners with emblems of elite Russian units. Fixed to wooden crosses are the portraits of soldiers, their names and the dates they died. The servicemen buried here lost their lives after 24 February: the start of President Putin's ""special military operation"" in Ukraine. At the cemetery I meet Dmitry. He lays red carnations at the grave of his former paratrooper comrade, an officer called Sergei Tysyachny. ""He was like a second father to me and the lads,"" Dmitry tells me. ""We love him, we respect him and we mourn for him."" Such praise for a Russian soldier jars with events on the ground in Ukraine. The Kremlin may insist that its military offensive there is necessary and justified. But the UN Secretary-General calls it ""a full-fledged invasion… in violation of the UN charter"". There is also international outrage at reports of apparent Russian military atrocities and alleged war crimes. ""I don't believe these fakes,"" Dmitry says about war crime allegations levelled against some Russian soldiers. ""I will never believe them. ""I know how my commander, Sergei, taught us to act. I trust my comrades and my army. They would never do things like this."" ""But investigations are under way,"" I continue. ""What if you were shown cast-iron evidence that crimes happened? Would you believe it then?"" ""I'm sure there will be no evidence,"" he replies. ""I'm certain."" This certainty that Russia is right (and the West wrong) is rooted in years of similar messaging here by the state media. The Kremlin uses its control of television to convince Russians they are living in a besieged fortress, surrounded by enemies - Nato, America, Britain, the EU, to name a few - who are plotting from morning till night to sow chaos in their country. President Putin's media monopoly has also helped him to persuade many here that Russians in Ukraine are battling ""Nazis"", ""neo-Nazis"", ""ultra-nationalists"" and ""liberating Ukraine from fascism"" - creating a parallel reality around events there. Since all independent Russian news sources have either been blocked or shut down, accessing alternative views in Russia has become increasingly difficult. Sergei Tysyachny's widow, Lada, agrees to meet me in the centre of Stavropol. ""I didn't want to believe it. I still can't completely believe it,"" Lada says of the moment she was told her husband had been killed. She, too, refuses to believe that Russian soldiers have committed atrocities. ""I know that the whole world is against us now,"" Lada says. ""They'll accuse Russia of anything."" And it turns out that Russia will accuse the West - and Western journalists - of anything. At the end of the day in Stavropol, we find ourselves making the news, not just covering it. A popular local website has published an article about the BBC's visit, along with a photograph of my cameraman and me interviewing Lada on a park bench. Here's an extract: ""It's easy to guess how the recently widowed resident of Stavropol must have felt talking to journalists from a country that is an accessory to the death of her husband."" This attempt to link Britain to the deaths of Russian soldiers in Ukraine shows how Western journalists in Russia are viewed, increasingly, as the enemy. And how the authorities here are searching for scapegoats for the horrors unfolding in Ukraine. "

Even the dogs on the streets seem to know, and can be heard barking whenever there's a heavy thump of artillery in the distance. Hundreds of thousands of people have already fled to the relative safety of western Ukraine. Once again large columns of Russian vehicles have been spotted by satellite - this time heading towards the east. Here in the Donbas we've also seen signs of Ukraine bringing in more military equipment, including armoured vehicles and longer range air defence systems. But not in the volume of Russia's reinforcements. Ukraine may be being more tactically astute about their movements, or simply have less. Both are probably true. Many believe this next phase of the war in the east could decide the outcome of this conflict. Many also expect it to be bloody. At our request, the Ukrainian army showed us one of their artillery lines that is already shelling Russian positions. The only way to get there was to travel in an armoured vehicle across fields. Much of the war here will be fought across open ground. Ukrainian troops will also take advantage of their already dug in defensive positions. We nervously looked up for any sign of Russian aircraft, but Ukraine still has air defences. We saw a vehicle fitted with radar and rockets and anti-aircraft guns, which we were asked not to film. There were more air defences at the artillery positions, including short-range Stinger anti-aircraft surface-to-air missiles supplied by the West. They were out of their box and ready to fire, should the Russian drones or jets target their positions. Such weapons have made a significant impact in this war - while Russia may have an advantage in the air, it still doesn't have control of the skies. Ukraine's artillery is, so far, also proving effective. We did not see long lines of artillery, but instead a small mobile unit ready to move at a moment's notice. While the Russians have a bigger army, Ukraine's forces rely on well prepared defences and mobility. Volodymyr, a Ukrainian soldier, told me they had to change position regularly to avoid being targeted. ""If we stay in one position for more than a couple of days, then we become the target,"" he said. He also highlighted another key difference; Ukraine's artillery was targeting military positions - Russian artillery - while Russia, he said, was also targeting towns and cities. ""They're shooting at our cities because they want people to panic. They want our people to give up,"" he said. Russia will struggle to make significant advances while Ukraine continues to have effective air defences and artillery. Both sides have, until now, had similar levels of forces in the region - around 30-40,000 troops. But Western officials say Russia is aiming to double or even triple its strength in the region. Though they add that might take considerable time as Russia reconstitutes its units. Some estimates suggest Russia has lost 20% of its strength since the start of this war. Ukraine also has some of its most battle-hardened troops in the region. They've been fighting Russian-backed separatists here for the past eight years. They're well dug in, using fortified trenches and defensive positions. Some of the troops may look tired, but morale appears to be high. Ukraine is also being given real time intelligence on Russia's military movements by their Western allies. They won't discuss details, but both Ukrainian and Western officials have confirmed this to the BBC. Russia still has a numerical advantage - tens of thousands more troops being redeployed after its failed offensive around the capital, Kyiv. Russia is also now fighting on fewer fronts and its supply lines won't be as long. Ukraine also has another problem to contend with - the enemy within. In the city of Kramatorsk we went on a police patrol looking for Russian saboteurs. There is more pro-Russian sentiment here than other parts of Ukraine. The police stop and search passers-by, looking for evidence they might be Russian saboteurs. They search mobile phones. They're worried about people passing on information and photographs of Ukrainian defensive positions. The local police chief, Col Alexander Malish, told me people are arrested and handed over to the intelligence services most days. ""I don't understand what's in their heads... maybe [it is] Russian propaganda? I think that after the war the people of Ukraine will have to work out what to do with people who've been helping the country of the occupying forces."" Col Malish said it was part of Russia's hybrid warfare. Several cities in eastern Ukraine have been targeted by Russian airstrikes, artillery and missiles. At a cemetery in Kramatorsk - where more than 50 people were killed in a Russian strike on a railway station last week - fresh graves are already being dug. We watched the burial service of a recent Ukrainian casualty from a distance. Alexander Tislenko was 34 when he was killed on the frontline, fighting for the Ukrainian special forces. All his mother, Tatiana, knows is that his position was being targeted by Russian Grad rockets before she was told he had been killed in combat. Tatiana held a photograph of Alexander above his coffin, draped in a Ukrainian flag. She couldn't stop crying. Alexander was her only child. Later, Tatiana told me: ""Our son has dedicated his life to his homeland Ukraine. I'm so proud of him, but it's such a big loss. It's a loss I cannot forget during my lifetime. I curse [Russian President Vladimir] Putin."" Over the coming weeks here in eastern Ukraine there will be many more grieving mothers of both Ukraine and Russia. This phase of the war will be difficult for both sides. Both are likely to suffer significant losses. But the stakes couldn't be higher. "

Hackers targeted one of its largest energy companies, trying to shut down substations, which would have caused blackouts for two million people. The malicious software used in the attack is similar to that used by Russian hackers who previous caused power cuts in Kyiv. Researchers believe Russian military group Sandworm is responsible. It is the most serious cyber-attack so far launched against Ukraine since the Russian invasion. In a press conference on Tuesday, Viktor Zhora, deputy chairman of the State Service of Special Communications, said his team were alerted to a possible attack on energy grids at the beginning of the invasion of his country. He said that despite a huge effort to secure the cyber-defences of energy organisations in the country, hackers had been able to compromise an unnamed private company responsible for supplying power to two million residents. ""The hackers planned the electrical outages for 8 April, to strike on Friday evening, before the weekend,"" Mr Zhora said. ""It looks like we have been extremely lucky to respond to this in a timely manner."" Mr Zhora thanked researchers at cyber-security companies Eset and Microsoft for helping to identify and neutralise the malicious software used in the attack. In a statement, Eset said it had worked closely with the Ukraine cyber authority ""in order to remediate and protect this critical infrastructure network"". It added: ""The collaboration resulted in the discovery of a new variant of Industroyer malware, which we, together with [Ukrainian cyber authority] Cert-UA, named Industroyer2."" Industroyer is the name given to the piece of malware that was used in 2016 to knock electricity substations in Kyiv offline for about an hour. That attack was blamed on a Kremlin-backed hacking team known as Sandworm, allegedly a Russian cyber-military unit and part of its foreign military intelligence agency, the GRU. Sandworm is also accused of causing blackouts which affected more than 200,000 homes in a number of towns and cities in Ukraine the year before. Russia denies carrying out the cyber-attacks but both incidents have been blamed publicly by the US and EU on Sandworm, and some individual hacking suspects have been named by cyber authorities. Researchers say that in this latest attack, Sandworm hackers made an attempt to deploy the Industroyer2 malware against high-voltage electrical sub-stations in Ukraine as well as deploying several destructive malware types, including CaddyWiper. CaddyWiper is one of a number of pieces of wiper software being spread around Ukraine, designed to delete data on infected computer systems. A wiper was also used to disrupt the US satellite communications provider Viasat on the first day of the Ukraine invasion. Western officials believe this was almost certainly the work of Russia but have not yet assembled the evidence to make a public accusation. The country has also been repeatedly bombarded with low-level cyber-attacks, and its government says there have been three times as many hacking attempts against its systems as before the war. "

Jacob Williams and Alina Kulyk are now with Mr Williams' parents in Newcastle-under-Lyme, Staffordshire. They were in Athens when Russia invaded Ukraine and then travelled to Poland where they waited for Mrs Kulyk to be given permission to travel to the UK. The couple, who met when Mr Williams was travelling, waited three weeks to get permission to come to the country. Since their arrival everyone they have come across have ""been very friendly"", Mrs Kulyk said. ""When they know I am from the Ukraine, they always try to talk to me and be real people with big hearts- it can't go unnoticed,"" she added. But she said she missed the ""little things"" about being home in Kyiv such as her plants and going to a bar with her friends. The couple said that they want to return to Kyiv as soon as they can even though they do not know what state their home is in, although they believe it is still standing. Mrs Kulyk's father now drives tanks to warehouses in East Ukraine and told his daughter that he can hear the shelling and the shooting. The couple had to wait nearly three weeks for a letter giving Mrs Kulyk permission to go to the UK to arrive. ""What we thought would be a few days for a letter turned into three weeks,"" said Mr Williams. ""My parents contacted our local MP Aaron Bell, for Newcastle-under-Lyme."" The couple were helped by Mr Bell's case worker who called the Home Office. ""I am Incredibly grateful that this scheme [Homes for Ukraine] was introduced,"" said Mr Williams, but added that it is not a visa waiver and it can be slow.

Jane and John McCready, who live in London, have welcomed one family into their home in Woolacombe, with a second to be housed in the annex from Saturday. The family of three, a grandmother, mother and daughter, fled their city of Kharkiv after the Russian invasion. Mother Natalia Bykovchenko said they were ""very grateful to be under a peaceful sky"". Ms Bykovchenko's mother Liubov and her nine-year-old daughter arrived at the McCready's second home on Friday. Mrs McCready said: ""It's not the poshest of places but it's warm and safe. ""We felt we wanted to do something."" She said the community of Woolacombe had been ""absolutely incredible"" in welcoming the family. ""They have opened the arms of friendship to the first family and no doubt will to the second,"" she added. Talking via a translator, Ms Bykovchenko told the BBC: ""Thanks so much to the people from Devon and the people from Great Britain for the warm welcome. ""I just wanted a safe place, we are very grateful to be under a peaceful sky and not hear any of the shelling and bombing."" She continued: ""Everything is absolutely fantastic and we are happy to be here and thank you so much to Jane McCready for allowing us to stay here in her house and we are settling well. ""They are very incredible, warm, nice people. They do their best to help us and already visited us a few times. We are amazed by the help from them.

Egdon Resource said extending permissions near North Kelsey could provide valuable UK-based oil reserves. On Monday, Lincolnshire County Council confirmed its decision to reject the appeal. Planners said Egdon had already had eight years to start work but had so far not begun. Councillor Paul Skinner said: ""They had the opportunity since 2014 and really I see they've done nothing."" Egdon was seeking the right to continue exploration for another 12 months, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service. In March, Egdon managing director Mark Abbot blamed Covid for delaying work and told council planners Russia's invasion of Ukraine meant a sufficient supply of UK produced oil was ""essential"". Campaigners said ""horrors"" in Ukraine had been ""seized upon by Egdon to justify this project"". They argued the amount of oil from the land would be ""trivial"" and said drilling would cause major harm to the area and its wildlife. Confirming it had turned down the drilling application, councillors said the worries of local residents had been made worse through the repeated extensions sought by Egdon. ""Representations from the local community made it clear prolonging the uncertainty with each extension has caused unacceptable levels of anxiety to local residents,"" a report to councillors said.

Anna Kolomiichuk and her son are staying with Conservative North Norfolk MP Duncan Baker. Before fleeing Ukraine, her husband had rescued their son from Melitopol, where he had been staying with her parents. Mrs Kolomiichuk said she was relieved to be safe but worried about people such as her husband still in Ukraine. She said she cannot ""find words to express how awful it is"" in Ukraine. ""The hardest thing to see is that there are people who don't believe this is really happening, who think it's fake,"" Mrs Kolomiichuk said. ""It is real and no matter what the news says. We have families, friends living in cities that have been bombed. ""Even though we are safe here and I would love to try to live a normal life, there's still part of me that's still in Ukraine and of course I worry about people who are there - lots of friends who decided to stay there or couldn't leave."" She said she was ""terrified"" when her son was staying with her parents in Melitopol at the start of the war. ""We didn't know whether we should drive to Melitopol right away but there were explosions and a shortage of fuel already. Everyone was terrified."" She said ""it was a really big risk"" for her husband to drive there but one he ""had to take"". Mrs Kolomiichuk is one of 500 refugees to be placed in Norfolk, where she said she has had ""so much support"". She said she has been made to ""feel at home"" by Mr Baker and his family.

711,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-61042314,2022-04-12T09:20:04,2+2 talks: How India and US agreed to differ on Ukraine war," Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and US President Joe Biden's virtual meeting came on the back of their differing stands on Ukraine. Days before their meeting, Mr Biden had called India's stand ""somewhat shaky"" and one US official had warned that India had been informed that the consequences of a ""more explicit strategic alignment"" with Moscow would be ""significant and long-term"". But India stood firm in its stand despite what appeared to be growing pressure from the US. Delhi continued to promote dialogue to end the war. It didn't criticise Russia directly but chose some strong words about the need to respect the sovereignty of each nation. In that backdrop, the leaders' summit - which was not planned and was requested by the White House - is significant for geopolitical developments. It was followed by the planned annual 2+2 Dialogue between Indian Foreign Minister S Jaishankar, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh, and their US counterparts Antony Blinken and Lloyd Austin in Washington. It's evident from the statements that both sides have shown willingness to understand each other's positions on Ukraine. Pratyush Rao, director for South Asia at Control Risks consultancy, said the visit came at a sensitive time for the relationship. ""This was a visible reaffirmation at the highest levels by both sides to the bilateral relationship, amidst all the media speculation about deepening strains over the Ukraine conflict. The message was, yes we do differ on Russia and will unlikely bridge the gap, but won't allow it to derail wider co-operation in the Indo-Pacific either,"" he added. While PM Modi and his ministers reaffirmed their stated policy of non-alignment on Ukraine, Mr Biden and his ministers appeared more understanding of Delhi's position - a marked shift from some earlier strong statements of Washington officials. Mr Blinken said India ""has to make its own decisions about how it approaches this challenge"". He also noted that India had issued strong statements at the UN and it had called for an independent investigation into the killings of civilians in Ukraine's Bucha. In a candid remark, he said ""India's relationship with Russia has developed over decades at a time when the United States was not able to be a partner to India"". He added that ""times have changed"" and the US was willing to be a partner of choice with India across virtually every realm - commerce, technology, education, and security. Former Indian diplomat Anil Triguniyat said this statement showed that the US has understood India's position in a broader geopolitical context. ""Both sides have too much to lose if the bilateral relations are strained. Their relationship is rich and the meetings just reaffirmed that,"" he added. Beyond Ukraine, the two sides also reaffirmed their commitment in continuing co-operation in the Indo-Pacific, and also in the trade, defence and security sectors. The US said it saw India as ""a net provider of security in the region"". ""China is seeking to refashion the region and the international system more broadly in ways that serve its interests,"" Mr Blinken said. Both the US and India agree on playing a bigger role in the region to counterbalance China's growing influence. India has a long disputed boundary with China. Their troops were involved in deadly clashes in the Galwan valley in 2020 that resulted in the deaths of 20 Indian soldiers. China said later it lost four troops in the clash. Mr Jaishankar acknowledged that the Quad - which includes India, the US, Japan and Australia - had emerged as ""a powerful force for global good"" and its ""elevation benefits the entire Indo-Pacific"". Mr Rao said India reposing its faith in the Quad was significant. Russia, India's time-tested ally, has criticised the Quad and called it a forum to target China. Both Moscow and Beijing have become closer and often jointly taken stands against the West. In that context, Mr Rao said that the Indian foreign minister's public and unequivocal endorsement of the Quad was important and will likely resonate among his audience in Washington. Washington also acknowledged that Russia is India's biggest defence supplier - accounting for more than 50% of its imports. In contrast, the US was India's second-largest supplier between 2011 and 2015 after Russia, but fell behind France and Israel in the period between 2016 and 2021. Former Indian diplomat Jitendra Nath Misra said India continued to import from Russia because it got good value for money, and, crucially, transfers of technology in some areas. ""The US needs to give commitments on technology transfers to be able to get a bigger share of India's defence imports,"" he said. Defence Minister Singh talked about PM Modi's ""Make in India"" campaign and invited US defence companies to set up shop in India. But there hasn't been any big-ticket announcement on this. However, a significant measure was announced about the two countries jointly developing air-launched unmanned aerial vehicles. ""More such measures are needed to address India's defence needs and help reduce its dependence on Moscow,"" Mr Misra added. But the crucial issue of India's acquisition of Russia's S-400 missile defence system remains unsolved. The purchase has come under the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (Caatsa), which was introduced in 2017 to target Russia, Iran and North Korea with economic and political sanctions. It also prohibits any country from signing defence deals with these nations. Mr Blinken said the ""US had not made a determination regarding potential sanctions or potential waivers under the CAATSA law"". There was also a veiled suggestion to India when Mr Blinken said the US was asking countries to avoid major new transactions for Russian weapons systems. Mr Triguniyat says the ambiguity over the S-400 showed that the US wanted to keep its options open but it doesn't want to rock the boat at the moment. It's clear that there is a lot more ground to cover for the US to replace Moscow as India's largest defence supplier. Meanwhile, Mr Blinken also talked about India's human rights record, saying the US was ""monitoring some recent concerning developments in India, including a rise in human rights abuses by some government, police, and prison officials"". The Indian ministers didn't respond to this but analysts say Democrats, including former president Obama, have raised such issues in the past. The statement may have caused discomfort to Indians but analysts say its unlikely that the issue will become a major irritant in the relationship. Indian companies have been trying to circumvent sanctions to take advantage of the discounted oil prices being offered by Russian firms. When this question was put to Mr Jaishankar, he denied that India was ramping up its oil imports from Russia. ""I suspect, looking at the figures, probably our total purchases [from Russia] for the month would be less than what Europe does in an afternoon. So you might want to think about that,"" he said. The US has steadily increased its export of crude oil and refined petroleum products to India - accounting for 15% of India-US trade, which stood at $113bn in 2021. The two countries believe that there is vast potential to take the bilateral trade to $500bn in the future. The two sides announced a series of measures, including restarting the US-India Commercial Dialogue and the US-India CEO Forum, to improve trade ties. "

Ukraine's Azov regiment said three soldiers were injured by ""a poisonous substance"" in an attack on Monday. However, no evidence has been presented to confirm the use of chemical weapons. UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said officials were working to ""urgently"" investigate what she called ""a callous escalation"" of the war. The Pentagon called the potential use of the weapons ""deeply concerning"". Western nations have warned that the use of chemical weapons would mark a dangerous escalation of the conflict and have pledged to take firm action if Russia carries out such attacks. Ukraine's Deputy Defence Minister Hanna Maliar said the government was investigating the allegations, adding that early assumptions suggested phosphorous ammunition had been used. Phosphorus is not classed as a chemical weapon under the Chemical Weapons Convention, but using it as an incendiary weapon near civilians would be illegal. On Tuesday, pro-Russian separatist forces in Donetsk denied carrying out the attack. The Azov battalion, which has been heavily involved in fighting in Mariupol and has strong ties to the far-right, wrote in a Telegram post that Russian forces had dropped ""a poisonous substance of unknown origin"" during a drone attack at the city's large Azovstal metals plant. It said that its fighters had suffered minor injuries, including shortness of breath. One injured man described a ""sweet-tasting"" white smoke covering an area of the plant after an explosion. Another said he felt immediately unable to breathe and had collapsed with ""cotton legs"". The reported incident - which the BBC cannot independently verify - came hours after a spokesperson for the Moscow-backed Donetsk People's Republic urged Russia to bring in ""chemical forces"" to the besieged south-eastern city. Eduard Basurin told Russian state TV the remaining Ukrainian forces in Mariupol were entrenched at the Azovstal plant and that Russia should encircle it and ""smoke out the moles"". Speaking on Monday night, President Volodymyr Zelensky said any use of chemical weapons would mark a ""new stage of terror against Ukraine"" and called on Western nations to arm his forces with the weapons needed to defend his country. ""Unfortunately, we are not getting as much as we need to end this war sooner,"" Mr Zelensky said. ""I am sure that we will get almost everything we need, but not only time is being lost. The lives of Ukrainians are being lost — lives that can no longer be returned."" UK Defence Minister James Heappey ruled nothing out in terms of a Western response if a chemical attack was confirmed. ""There are some things that are beyond the pale, and the use of chemical weapons will get a response and all options are on the table for what that response could be,"" he said. Last month US President Joe Biden said Nato ""would respond"" if Russia used chemical weapons in Ukraine. ""The nature of the response would depend on the nature of the use,"" he said. "

Soaring food and fuel costs, together with budget cuts in some traditional donor countries, have forced the WFP to halve the amount of food it is giving to millions of people in Yemen, Chad and Niger. In December 2021, the UN made a record appeal for $41bn (£31bn) to help 273 million people this year. As aid workers stress, these are not people who will be made a bit more comfortable by help from the UN. They are people, particularly children, who will probably die without it. But that appeal was made before Russia invaded Ukraine. Both countries used to sell grain to the WFP. Back then, Ukraine was a supplier, not a country in need of humanitarian assistance, as the WFP's Geneva director Annalisa Conte points out. In the first month of the war, the WFP reached a million people inside Ukraine. But its supply of Ukrainian grain, destined to feed some of the hungriest on the planet, has dried up. Meanwhile, many African countries, while not dependent on UN aid, import grain from Ukraine. Somalia gets more than 60% of its grain from Ukraine and Russia, while Eritrea gets nearly 97% of its wheat from Ukraine. They now have to bid against Europeans and North Americans on the international market in search of food. Jan Egeland, former head of UN emergency relief and now with the Norwegian Refugee Council, describes this as a ""catastrophe"" for the poorest parts of the world. ""They will starve,"" he says. This March, in the hope of reminding donors of the continued needs in Yemen and Afghanistan, the UN launched emergency ""flash"" appeals. UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres warned that Afghans were ""selling their children, and their body parts, in order to feed their families"". But the flash appeal for Afghanistan achieved about half of what the UN asked for. A similar appeal for Yemen, which the UN says is the world's worst humanitarian crisis, got less than a third. Although aid workers don't like to say it publicly, there is an uneasy feeling that traditional donor countries in Europe, who in recent weeks have raised record sums for Ukraine and offered tens of thousands of places in their homes for Ukrainian refugees, are being somewhat selective about who they help. There is no question that vulnerable civilians in Ukraine ""deserve all our compassion, and the outpouring of generosity that we have seen"", says Robert Mardini, director general of the International Committee of the Red Cross. But, he adds, there is a long list of unresolved conflicts elsewhere that continue to unfold day in, day out. The crises in Afghanistan, Yemen and Syria among others have only got worse since the Ukraine war. Jan Egeland admits aid agencies feel ""overstretched, underfunded, overwhelmed like never before"". The generosity towards Ukrainians who have fled their homes has been welcomed by the UN Refugee Agency. But aid workers also know that until quite recently, many European countries, among them Hungary and Poland, were pushing Syrian refugees back across their borders. The refugee agency's Shabia Mantoo thinks the Ukraine war could be an opportunity for the world to come to a better understanding of what it is to be a refugee, or to be a neighbouring country, like Lebanon, Uganda or Turkey, hosting hundreds of thousands of people. She hopes the countries now throwing their doors open to Ukrainian refugees will ""extend that solidarity, that compassion to all others in a similar situation"". But even if this crisis does cause a surge in global solidarity, aid agencies know this will be a very difficult year. The fact that Russia, a permanent, veto-wielding member of the UN Security Council, is the aggressor in this latest war will probably make the delivery of aid more complicated. The UN needs co-operation between Russia and the West, for example, for cross-border deliveries to Syria. But this relationship is now ""in the deep freeze"", as Jan Egeland puts it. Meanwhile, food and fuel prices are set to rise still further, while wealthy countries are looking to balance their books after spending tens of billions on their Covid recovery programmes. It's a perfect storm, aid workers say, which shows once again that humanitarian aid is never a solution and usually only an inadequate sticking plaster on the gaping wound of war. Peace is the precondition to everything else, says Annalisa Conte. "

When the 30-year-old, who worked in an IT company, arrived at the Delhi airport on 17 March, she was welcomed by Anubhav Bhasin, the 33-year-old lawyer she'd been dating for just over a year. As drummers beat out celebratory tunes, Anubhav went down on one knee and proposed to her and placed a ring on her finger when she said yes. On Sunday, the couple were married in an intimate ceremony in the Indian capital. Later this month, they will register their wedding in court to make it legally valid. Anna's one-year visa states the purpose of her India visit is to ""marry Anubhav Bhasin"". The couple met in August 2019 by chance in a bar while she was on a solo trip to India. They exchanged numbers, followed each other on Instagram, and the rest, as they say, is history. Their relationship took shape over different continents separated by geography, meeting plans disrupted by the pandemic, quarantine rules and flight restrictions, and finally the Russian invasion of Anna's homeland. ""By the end of the 2019, we were talking a lot,"" says Anubhav. In march 2020, Anna visited India again along with a girlfriend and Anubhav took them on a road trip to Agra - to see the Taj Mahal, the monument of love - and the desert state of Rajasthan. As India went into a sudden lockdown, he invited them to stay at his family home in Delhi. ""It was during that time that we grew very close, we realised we liked each other. We now knew this was more than a fling. After she returned to Kyiv, we kept in touch through daily video calls,"" he says. Their next meeting in February 2021 in Dubai, he adds, was ""a pivotal moment in our relationship when we realised that we had to find a way to take it forward"". Things moved fast after that - in August he visited her in Kyiv and in December she came back to India. ""On the last day of my visit, Anubhav's mother suggested we get married in March. We were discussing marriage at some point but it was surprising that it had come so soon. But I thought why not just go for it,"" says Anna. Anubhav is Hindu and Anna is Christian, so their wedding would have to be registered in court under a special law and the formalities could take more than a month, says Anubhav. So the couple decided that she would come to India at March-end to start the process and move to India for good a few months later. But then came the war. ""We knew that diplomacy had failed but we still thought war could be averted,"" says Anna. ""Many of us also believed that the attacks would be concentrated on the border and that Kyiv would be safe. ""But on 24 February, I woke up to the sound of bombing and my first thought was, ""Am I dreaming?"" Then I saw messages from Anubhav and others confirming that we were under attack,"" she adds. Many of the people she knew started packing their belongings and friends advised her to do the same. As shelling intensified, the next day she moved to a bunker with her mother and her dog. ""It was filled with people. There was a curfew and we weren't allowed to leave the bunker but I had to go out to breathe and walk the dog. The city was filled with the smell of smoke and the sky was so red,"" she says. Days before Russia started bombing Ukraine, Anubhav had been asking her to leave because he felt war was imminent, but Anna was reluctant to leave without her dog. But on the morning of 26 February, when she decided to leave, Anubhav tried to dissuade her. ""By then, things had become really bad,"" he says. ""There was frequent shelling and the train station was far away and there were no taxis to take them. I was scared that she would be out on the street and there was a lot that could go wrong. So I told her it would be safer to stay in the bunker."" But the next morning, she found a taxi and managed to reach the station. After putting her mother and her dog on a train to her grandmother's village, she boarded a train to Lviv on the western border. The trip out of Ukraine took her first to Slovakia, then to Poland - where she waited for two weeks while Anubhav worked with the Indian embassy to organise her visa - and finally to Helsinki, in Finland, for her flight to Delhi. ""I couldn't sleep a wink on the flight. I was stressed out. Even though we weren't flying over the conflict zone, I was worried that the plane might get hit by a rogue missile and we would crash."" On the morning of 17 March when she landed in Delhi, there was a text waiting for her from Anubhav - it said he was running a bit late. ""I was super annoyed,"" she told me. ""I was exhausted. I just wanted to go home and sleep. But when I came out, he was there with music and balloons."" As a dozen of Anubhav's friends cheered, many strangers joined in clapping and filming a scene that seemed straight out of a Hollywood romance. ""I had not expected this because Anubhav is generally a very practical person, but it was a pleasant surprise for sure,"" says Anna. As the couple now get married and start a new life together, Anna says once the war is over, she will return to Kyiv ""to wrap up things and pick up my dog"". In their heart-warming love story though, they say, the ""real hero"" is the coffee machine. ""A few months back when I told my grandmother about my wedding plans, she gave me some money for a present,"" says Anna. ""Since Anubhav loves his espressos, I decided to buy us a coffee machine. And when I left Kyiv, I had to bring it with me. Anubhav was saying don't bother, we'll get one here, but in my head I was thinking if I couldn't go home soon, then what would happen?"" Adds Anubhav: ""Anna is a trained make-up artist but she left behind her really expensive make-up to bring this coffee machine here. I think this machine is the real hero of our love story."" "

Sasha Makoviy said she wrote little Vira's name, age and some phone numbers on her, in case the family were separated or killed while fleeing Kyiv. ""In case of our death, she could be found and would know who she is,"" Ms Makoviy explained. The family are now in France where they feel ""surrounded with love and care"". After arriving, Ms Makoviy posted a photo of the writing on Vira's back to Instagram, and the image has since gone viral. ""It was the first day of the war, and we were preparing everything to flee from Kyiv and I was just not sure if it was safe,"" Ms Makoviy told The World Tonight on BBC Radio 4. Packing their belongings under the sound of falling bombs and with little information available, she said she ""wasn't sure if we would come outside our house and be attacked by rockets"". ""It was my biggest fear that Vira gets lost or that we become dead and she never finds out who she is, or what family she is from,"" Ms Makoviy said. Worried that her daughter might live but have no surviving family members, Ms Makoviy hoped that at least Vira would one day be able to look up her mother's social media accounts to know what she looked like. ""I thought that she can find some information from the internet, maybe find my account on Instagram - and maybe she could see her parents,"" she said. Having finally reached the safety of France after a long escape through Moldova, Romania and Belgium, Ms Makoviy says she is mentally ""crushed"". The war was so traumatic, she says, that simply walking outside is frightening, because she mistakes stones for landmines. ""Vira is fine. She is too small to understand what is going on. She can feel something from me, but she is too small to understand. I'm really happy about her age. Really happy."" "
717,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-61071243,2022-04-11T21:15:23,Ukraine conflict: 'Russian soldiers raped me and killed my husband'," The Russians have withdrawn from areas around Kyiv, but they've left deeply wounded lives that might never recover from the trauma. The BBC has heard first-hand testimony and found evidence of Ukrainian women being raped by invading soldiers. Warning: This report contains graphic descriptions of sexual violence In a quiet, rural neighbourhood 70km (45miles) west of Kyiv, we spoke to Anna, who is 50. We have changed her name to protect her identity. Anna told us that on 7 March she had been at home with her husband when a foreign soldier barged in. ""At gunpoint, he took me to a house nearby. He ordered me: 'Take your clothes off or I'll shoot you.' He kept threatening to kill me if I didn't do as he said. Then he started raping me,"" she said. Anna described her attacker as a young, thin, Chechen fighter allied with Russia. ""While he was raping me, four more soldiers entered. I thought that I was done for. But they took him away. I never saw him again,"" she said. She believes she was saved by a separate unit of Russian soldiers. Anna went back home and found her husband. He had been shot in the abdomen. ""He had tried to run after me to save me, but he was hit by a round of bullets,"" she said. They both sought shelter in a neighbour's house. They couldn't take her husband to hospital because of the fighting. He died of his injuries two days later. Anna never stopped crying while telling us her story. She showed us where she and her neighbours buried her husband in the backyard of their home. A tall, wooden cross stands at the head of the grave. Anna told us that she is in contact with the local hospital and is receiving psychological support. The soldiers who saved her stayed in her house for a few days. She says they would point their gun at her and ask her to give them her husband's belongings. ""When they left, I found drugs and Viagra. They would get high and they were often drunk. Most of them are killers, rapists and looters. Only a few are OK,"" she said. Down the road from Anna's house, we heard another chilling story. A woman was allegedly raped and killed, and neighbours say it was done by the same man who raped Anna, before he went to Anna's house. The woman was in her 40s. She was taken out of her home, say neighbours, and held in the bedroom of a house nearby whose occupants had evacuated when the war began. The well-decorated room, with ornate wallpaper and a bed with a golden headboard, is now a disturbing crime scene. There are large bloodstains on the mattress and duvet. In a corner is a mirror with a note written in lipstick, appearing to suggest where the victim was buried. Oksana, a neighbour, told us it had been left there by Russian soldiers who found the woman's body and buried her. ""They [Russian soldiers] told me she had been raped and that her throat was either slit or stabbed, and she bled to death. They said there was a lot of blood."" The woman was buried in a grave in the garden of the house. A day after we visited, the police exhumed her body to investigate the case. The body was found without clothes, and with a deep, long, cut across the neck. Andrii Nebytov, the police chief of the Kyiv region, told us about another case they're investigating in a village 50km (30 miles) to the west of Kyiv. A family of three - a couple in their thirties and their young child - lived in a house on the edge of the village. ""On 9 March, several soldiers of the Russian army entered the house. The husband tried to protect his wife and child. So they shot him in the yard,"" said Mr Nebytov. ""After that, two soldiers repeatedly raped the wife. They would leave and then come back. They returned three times to rape her. They threatened that if she resisted they would harm her little boy. To protect her child she didn't resist."" When the soldiers left, they burnt down the house and shot the family's dogs. The woman escaped with her son and then contacted the police. Mr Nebytov says his team has met her and recorded her testimony. They have been gathering evidence at the family home - only its shell is now left. Just a few signs of a previous peaceful, ordinary life lie in the charred ruins. We saw a child's bicycle, a stuffed horse, a dog's leash and a man's fur lined winter shoe. The husband was buried in the garden by neighbours. The police have now exhumed his body for examination. They plan to take the case to international courts. Ukraine's ombudsman for human rights Lyudmyla Denisova says they're documenting several such cases. ""About 25 girls and women aged 14 to 24 were systematically raped during the occupation in the basement of one house in Bucha. Nine of them are pregnant,"" she said. ""Russian soldiers told them they would rape them to the point where they wouldn't want sexual contact with any man, to prevent them from having Ukrainian children."" She says they are receiving several calls on support helplines - and also getting information through channels on the Telegram messaging app. ""A 25-year-old woman called to tell us her 16-year-old sister was raped in the street in front of her. She said they were screaming 'This will happen to every Nazi prostitute' as they raped her sister,"" Ms Denisova said. We asked if it was possible to assess the scale of sexual crimes committed by Russian troops during the occupation. ""It is impossible at the moment because not everyone is willing to tell us what happened to them. The majority of them currently call for psychological support, so we cannot record those as crimes unless they give us their testimony,"" Ms Denisova said. She says Ukraine wants a special tribunal to be set up by the United Nations to try Vladimir Putin personally for allegations of war crimes including rape. ""I want to ask Putin, why is this happening?"" said Anna, the woman who told us she was raped. ""I don't understand. We're not living in the Stone Age, why can't he negotiate? Why is he occupying and killing?"" Additional reporting by Imogen Anderson, Anastasiia Levchenko, Daria Sipigina and Sanjay Ganguly "

A brigade fighting in the city said they could be facing a ""last battle"" and that they would soon have to choose between Russian captivity and death. But the exact picture of what is happening in the city is unclear. Mariupol's deputy mayor called the reports ""fake"" and said Ukraine's forces were holding out. Mariupol's defence against Russian occupation has turned the city into a national symbol of resistance. The port city - which Russian forces have tried and failed to capture fully since the beginning of the war - is critical for Moscow as it would establish a land corridor between Russian-occupied Crimea and the Donbas region in eastern Ukraine. For weeks Russian troops have cut off essential supplies into Mariupol, bombarding its buildings and blocking survivors from escaping. The battle for Mariupol can be seen as part of Russia's shift in focus to eastern Ukraine. Here's how Russia's attack may play out. Responding to the news that the two Nordic neighbours could apply for Nato membership - Russia says any enlargement of the Western military alliance would not result in more stability. ""Further [Nato] expansion will not bring additional security to the European continent,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said to reporters. Russian's disapproval is no surprise: for decades Moscow has opposed any more European countries joining the alliance. But Russia's invasion of Ukraine has prompted Finland and Sweden to seriously consider asking for membership, which comes with security guarantees that Ukraine as a non-member didn't have. The face-to-face meeting is the first to have been held between a Western leader and President Putin since the invasion began. Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer says he went to the Russian capital to confront Putin with the facts, but didn't leave with a positive impression. ""If you're asking me whether I am optimistic or pessimistic, I'm rather pessimistic,"" he said, adding there was ""little interest"" on the Russian side about a direct meting between Mr Putin and the Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky. For his part, President Zelensky was asked whether he would hand over any part of Ukraine to Russia. He said he was ""not ready"" for that, but accepted it would be part of any discussion. Millions of social media users are viewing posts portraying Russian president Vladimir Putin as smiling, benevolent and peace-loving. But a joint BBC investigation into ten pro-Putin Facebook groups found that many of their most active posters were actually duplicate accounts. It's an example of pro-Kremlin ""astroturfing,"" an online tactic designed to create the impression that a movement has more support than it does. Marina Ovsyannikova, the editor who was detained and fined after holding an anti-war protest during a live broadcast on Russian state television last month, has a new role. The 43-year-old journalist has been hired as a correspondent by the company which owns Die Welt newspaper. Ms Ovsyannikova will be reporting for the outlet from Ukraine and Russia - she previously said that despite fearing for her safety she would not leave Russia. "

Chris Bater claims it is unfair he is ineligible for the Homes for Ukraine Scheme because they are not strangers. This is because Mr Bater has taken them in under the Family Scheme. The government said it was reducing the financial burden for those hosting Ukrainian relatives by giving them access to work, study and benefits. Mr Bater, who lives in Stoke Bishop with his wife Taisa, revealed she was due to fly from Kyiv to Stansted the day after Russia invaded on 24 February. Believing that staying together would keep them safe, Taisa had her two children, daughter-in-law and three grandchildren move into her Kyiv flat. Just over a week later Taisa, her daughter-in-law-and grandchildren caught a bus to Warsaw in Poland before eventually arriving in Bristol on 17 March. Her two adult children remain in the Ukrainian capital. Getting them here under the Family Scheme did not qualify Mr Bater for the benefit, despite him now having four extra people living in his house. Speaking to BBC Points West, he said: ""It's not a fair situation. We're doing our best to help people leaving a country that has been ripped apart."" He said that the government needs to assist people who are helping the refugees because the current scheme ""isn't really working at the moment"". A government spokesperson said the ""Homes for Ukraine and Ukraine Family schemes are one of the fastest and biggest visa programmes in UK history"". They added the Ukraine Schemes give people ""full access to work, study and benefits, including Universal Credit payments from day one"". "

Others will open later in the week in Newry, County Down, Craigavon, County Armagh and Ballymena, County Antrim. There is no official figure for the number of Ukrainian refugees who have arrived in Northern Ireland since the Russian invasion in February, but it is estimated to be about 300. The assistance centres will provide advice on a number of areas. These include: One of the most recent people to arrive in Belfast was Sofi Ostymchuk, 25, who arrived last week from Kyiv, with her 13-year-old sister. She told BBC News NI that the advice centres would be a big help. ""You need this supportive environment, where you can just come and get answers to all your questions,"" said Sofi. ""Without such centres, there is no place where people can get all the help and all the answers."" Sofi has travelled abroad before and speaks fluent English but recognises that many Ukrainians will be in an English-speaking country for the first time. ""The centres are also another way in which we can meet other people from our homeland to have a piece of home here (in Belfast)… and build a little community here, to talk one another, to hug each other, to stay together,"" she said. Two schemes have been set up by the UK government to facilitate the arrival of Ukrainians. Most people have come to Northern Ireland under the family scheme in which refugees stay with relatives already in the UK. The other scheme, entitled Homes for Ukraine, is for refugees with no existing ties who are housed by people who have offered accommodation. Across the UK, 12,500 visas have, so far, been issued as part of this scheme, 90 of them to people in Northern Ireland. The advice centres have been set up by Stormont's executive office. In Belfast, the centre is based in the Cecil Ward Building, 4-10 Linenhall Street, and will be open from 09:30 BST to 16:00 BST on Monday 11 April and Friday 15 April. In Newry, the centre will be based in Newry Leisure Centre, 60 Cecil Street, and will be open from 09:30 BST to 16:00 BST on Tuesday 12 April. In Craigavon, the centre will be based in Brownlow Community Hub, 7 Brownlow Road, and will be open from 09:30 BST to 16:00 BST on Wednesday 13 April. In Ballymena, the centre will be based in The Braid, 1-29 Bridge Street, and will be open from 09:30 BST to 16:00 BST on Thursday 14 April. Those attending the centres are asked to bring ID and details of the scheme with which they registered. "

Deputy mayor Serhiy Orlov told the BBC that ""battles for Mariupol continue"". He also denied reports about a marine brigade which posted to Facebook about running out of ammunition and facing a ""last battle"". ""The information about the marines is fake. I don't comment on fakes."" ""The Russians temporarily occupied part of the city. Ukrainian soldiers continue defending the central and southern parts of the city, as well as industrial areas and so on,"" Mr Orlov said. In a Facebook post, Ukrainian armed forces Commander-in-Chief Valerii Zaluzhnyi said the military still had stable, open lines of communication with its soldiers inside the city. The military is doing ""the possible and impossible"" to save lives and fight against Russian forces, he wrote. Mariupol lies between the pro-Russia breakaway regions of Donetsk and Luhansk in the east, and annexed Crimea in the south. Seizing the city has been a major goal of the Russian offensive. Western officials are warning that this is an ""incredibly important window"" for vital support to Ukraine, as Russia prepares to double or triple the number of troops it has in the country's eastern Donbas region. In briefings, officials say Russia is re-equipping its combat units and adding fresh troops - which will take time. In the meantime, Western economic and military aid for Ukraine could prove valuable in preparing for any renewed offensive. Meanwhile, Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky said that tens of thousands of people had likely been killed in Mariupol. The BBC has not verified the figure, but reports from the region and the refugees fleeing the city spoke of bodies lying in the streets and most buildings damaged or destroyed. The 36th marine brigade earlier posted on Facebook warning that after 47 days of defending the city, the unit had been surrounded by the Russian army, and was facing ""hand-to-hand combat"". The post - which Mr Orlov labelled a fake - promised Ukrainians its soldiers ""did everything possible and impossible"" to stop the Russian advance. ""Today will probably be the last battle, as the ammunition is running out... it's death for some of us and captivity for the rest,"" it said. It also complained about a lack of support from other parts of the Ukrainian military, with aid promised which never came. The post said the marines have been pushed back to the Azovmash factory in the city. It is believed there is also fighting inside the Azovstal industrial zone, which is on the coast. Some experts expressed scepticism about the post, suggesting that the Facebook page could have been hacked by Russian operatives. But others are sure that it is authentic. Mariupol has seen little let-up in the fighting since the war began, with little humanitarian aid, long delays to evacuations, and reports of civilians starving or being forcibly removed to Russia-held territory. The head of pro-Russia Donetsk separatists, Denis Pushilin, told Russian media that he thought more than 5,000 people may have been killed, though he blamed Ukrainian forces. Russian forces have continued to slowly advance and seize more of the city in recent weeks - unlike in the rest of Ukraine, where they have ""refocused"" military action around the breakaway regions in the east, largely pulling out of other areas such as near the capital, Kyiv. As a result, Ukrainian officials are focusing on evacuating civilians from eastern towns and cities in anticipation of a renewed assault in some places. Nine new humanitarian corridors have been agreed between Ukraine and Russia, to allow civilians to flee, including from Mariupol. Ukraine is also putting on extra trains to extract people from the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, where Russia is focusing its efforts. Mr Zelensky said that tens of thousands of pro-Russian troops are believed to have redeployed and massed in the area, and a renewed offensive is widely expected to come soon. "

More than 80% of South Yorkshire's Circus Cortex are Ukrainian. Boss Irina Archer said suspension of UK work visas and the conscription of men into Ukraine's military had stopped some members returning to the UK. Ms Archer, who said she was half-Ukrainian and half-Russian, described the war as ""unbearable"". She said the performers had gone home over the winter to see their families and to renew their work visas and were then trapped when Russia invaded Ukraine in February. The Home Office had since frozen work visa applications from people in Ukraine, Ms Archer added. She said he had kept in touch via messaging and video chats with some of the troupe's performers stuck in Ukraine. One man who performed as a clown for Circus Cortex had been drafted into the Ukrainian army and was now using his talents to entertain children in the breaks between fighting, Ms Archer said. On the day the Russian invasion started, Ms Archer said she watched in disbelief as her circus artists in Ukraine texted her to say the war was under way. ""The whole thing is just unbearable,"" she said. ""The fact that Russia are involved in Ukraine is like the mum is fighting with dad. ""Nearly every Russian has Ukrainian relatives one way or another. They managed to co-exist up until 2014 without any problems."" The circus had since found 12 alternative Ukrainian performers around the world who had already escaped the country, she added. They were now heading for the UK under the Home for Ukraine scheme, which allows UK families to sponsor Ukrainian refugees and provides a place for them to live. Ms Archer said she was personally taking in four people and, following a post on social media, several families in South Yorkshire would be housing the others. Using the Home for Ukraine scheme would also protect those performers who would be unable to return to their war-torn homeland after the circus tour ended, she added. ""We think the fair thing for them to do is have the same visa all the other refugees are having,"" Ms Archer said. The latest government figures show that 98 sponsorship visas have so far been issued in South Yorkshire. The Circus Cortex UK tour, which was due to start on 8 April, is now expected to start in Sheffield on 25 May. Follow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

They reveal how a Swiss tattoo artist was falsely named as owner of a company that transferred over $300m (£230m) to firms linked to Suleiman Kerimov. They also show how $700m of transactions - and the secret ownership of luxury properties - went undetected. The investigation exposes failures of the banking system and the obstacles impeding Western sanctions. As part of the Pandora Papers Russia project, an investigation led by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ), the BBC has discovered evidence that: Tom Keatinge, director of the Centre for Financial Crime and Security Studies at the defence think tank RUSI, said the oligarchs Western countries are trying to sanction have many of these shell companies. ""That just shows you how big a challenge we are going to have in genuinely enforcing the sanctions against oligarchs - beyond just seizing their yachts and houses in Belgravia."" Suleiman Kerimov appeared in February with a dozen other billionaires alongside President Putin, as Russian tanks crossed into Ukraine. He has been subject to US sanctions since 2018 ""for being an official of the government of the Russian Federation"" having served as a member of both the lower and upper houses of parliament. He was sanctioned by the UK government on 15 March this year, as well as by the EU, which said he was ""a member of the inner circle of oligarchs"" close to Putin. Mr Kerimov rose from humble origins as a Soviet era economist to become one of Russia's richest and best-connected oligarchs. He made his fortune buying up energy assets and major stakes in Russian banks after the fall of the Soviet Union. He reportedly made $21bn investing in the giant gas company Gazprom - and Sberbank, the biggest state bank. In November 2006, he almost died from injuries sustained in an accident in southern France. He skidded off Nice's Promenade des Anglais in a $650,000 Ferrari Enzo, which burst into flames. Mr Kerimov and his female passenger were pulled from the wreckage. Our investigation of Mr Kerimov exposes the failure of the international banking system to identify who was behind hundreds of millions of dollars of transactions which banks identified as suspect. Mr Kerimov is among more than 4,000 Russians whose names appear in data obtained by the ICIJ and examined as part of Pandora Papers Russia - a new investigation by ICIJ and global partners to shed light on covert financial transactions linked to the oligarchs and others close to the Kremlin in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Corporate records show how fake owners were used to heighten secrecy and that banks did not know exactly who was behind big US dollar transactions. That throws into doubt the ability of governments to identify and seize the assets of those they are targeting in the aftermath of the invasion. ""We are coming for your ill-begotten gains,"" US President Joe Biden pledged in his annual State of the Union speech. The US has announced a major intergovernmental programme to identify oligarch assets. But that won't be easy, as the Kerimov case highlights. Experts say Western countries have a lot of work to do because, for years, they have taken a lax approach to the fight against dirty money and failed to hold banks to account. ""They are going to have to play a lot of catch-up if they want to follow through with this,"" said Julia Friedlander, a former US Treasury Department sanctions adviser now with the Atlantic Council think tank. These are the key new findings relating to Suleiman Kerimov. A secret French court document - seen by the BBC - reveals how the oligarch is alleged to have hidden his wealth behind one of his closest associates. Mr Kerimov was arrested in November 2017 in France on suspicion of laundering the proceeds of tax evasion. The case against him related to the purchase of a string of luxury properties in the French Riviera between 2006 and 2010. It focused on Villa Hier in Cap d'Antibes, a luxurious property once used as a filming location for the 1988 film Dirty, Rotten Scoundrels. It had been sold to a Swiss company called Swiru Holding AG in 2008 for €35m (£29.3m) - but investigators discovered hidden payments showing tax had been evaded on the real purchase price of €127m. Alexander Studhalter, a Swiss accountant and businessman was also arrested. He claimed to be the owner of Swiru Holding and of four villas, but French investigators believed they were really owned by the Russian oligarch. They believed Mr Studhalter was a false beneficial owner, or straw man, for Mr Kerimov - but criminal cases against both men were halted, with indictments against them being cancelled by a French appeal court. In 2020, Swiru Holding accepted its involvement in evading the tax and was fined €1.4m and made to pay another €10.3m to settle the case. Mr Kerimov's lawyer put out a statement saying that the French courts had ""officially dismissed the allegations made by the former Nice Prosecutor against Suleiman Kerimov of having carried out money-laundering operations."" Mr Studhalter maintains he was ""never the straw man for my Russian friend"". But according to the leaked French court document, seen by the BBC, this is not true. At a secret hearing in June 2018, judges laid out evidence collected by the investigating magistrate, which concluded: ""the effective and exclusive beneficiary of the villas is Mr Kerimov and his family."" The evidence included records from three banks - including documents apparently signed by Mr Studhalter, Mr Kerimov and his nephew Nariman Gadzhiev - stating that Mr Kerimov and his nephew were the true owners of Swiru Holding. In response, the court recorded, Mr Studhalter claimed the ""documents held by the bank and signed by Suleyman Kerimov or Nariman Gadzhiev… were forgeries"". In response to questions from the BBC and ICIJ partners, Mr Studhalter claimed the same bank employee had forged documents at two banks, but said he didn't know why. Mr Studhalter also said: ""I was the sole beneficial owner of Swiru Holding AG from its foundation until I sold the company in 2019, as confirmed by the Swiss Federal Tax Administration and a court in France."" Mr Kerimov's French lawyers said: ""After several years of investigation, no charges were brought against our client."" Mr Studhalter says the four villas in France have now been sold. Official records in France show the ultimate beneficial owner of the companies that own them is Mr Kerimov's daughter. France was not the only country where Mr Kerimov used Swiru Holding to conduct secret financial transactions. Our investigation has discovered that - at the same time the Russian billionaire was buying up properties in the south of France - he was building another secret property empire in London. One Cornwall Terrace is a luxury four-storey mansion at the end of a row of terraced houses overlooking Regent's Park in London. The home is connected to half an acre of landscaped grounds, with a grand double staircase leading on to an imposing courtyard. It hit the headlines in 2013 when its sale for a reported £80m made it one of the most expensive terraced properties ever sold in the UK. In October last year, documents from the Pandora Papers financial leak revealed it was one of two adjacent properties purchased by the ruling family of Qatar. But the documents show it was bought for £21m in 2005 by an offshore company owned by Swiru Holding, the same company that bank documents in France showed was owned by Mr Kerimov. Following the successful launch of Mr Kerimov's company Polyus Gold - Russia's largest producer of gold - on the London stock exchange in 2007, One Cornwall Terrace benefitted from a lavish restoration. The work carried out between 2008 to 2013 was a bonanza for London's architects, interior designers, and landscape gardeners. The renovation cost £30m, according to architects working on the project and included the addition of a ""state-of-art swimming pool and spa to the basement"", while the garden renovation was ""inspired by Piazza dell'Anfiteatro in Lucca, Italy"". But, while references were made to a ""a private Russian client"", Mr Kerimov's ownership of the property was hidden behind layers of offshore secrecy. The financial activities of the company secretly owned by Mr Kerimov were not limited to the property market. Documents from the Pandora Papers show Swiru Holding at the centre of a web of companies involved in transfers of hundreds of millions of dollars linked to the oligarch. In one case, leaked corporate records reveal a nominee shareholder - someone who owns shares for the benefit of another person - was falsely named as the true owner of a company involved in over $300m of money transfers. Renato Coppo is a tattoo artist in the picturesque Swiss city of Lucerne with a love of ""Asian art"" and ""many years of professional experience in the field of tattooing"". His studio is in the same city as the offices of the accountant and businessman Alexander Studhalter. According to documents dated 2016 - one signed by Mr Studhalter - Mr Coppo was also the beneficial owner of Fletcher Ventures, a company registered in the British Virgin Islands, but administered in Switzerland by Swiru Holding. The tattoo artist's company Fletcher Ventures was involved in huge transactions. In 2013, the company transferred $100m to a firm called LT Trading Ltd. It was one of a number of transactions by Fletcher Ventures that set off alarm bells at US bank BNY Mellon. The bank filed a suspicious activity report with the US Treasury, which traced Fletcher Ventures to Switzerland. Renato Coppo was not identified and the bank could not identify exactly where the money was going. The bank's ""internet research"" traced LT Trading to a UK address. Bank officials noted the UK company specialised ""in the sale of fruits and vegetables"". It was ""suspicious"" they concluded ""because it appears to be inconsistent with the purported line of business of LT Trading Limited"". In fact, the bank had identified a firm of the same name in the wrong country. Leaked documents from the Pandora Papers show LT Trading had no connection to the British produce company of the same name. The beneficial owner of LT Trading named in corporate records was Mr Kerimov's nephew, Nariman Gadzhiev. Like Fletcher Ventures, the company was administered in Switzerland by Swiru Holding. The transaction was just one in a series of wire transfers carried out from 2010 to 2015 totalling $700m reported to US authorities as suspicious and where bank officials failed to identify links to the Russian oligarch. The filings were found in a cache of secret reports obtained by the ICIJ for the FinCEN Files investigation in 2020. Leaked records also show that in 2013, Fletcher Ventures sent $202m to LLC Gilia in Moscow, a company with links to a Kerimov investment company. Bank officials were unable to identify who was behind the Russian firm. BNY Mellon says it is forbidden to comment on its secret intelligence filings but that it fully complies with relevant laws and regulations. When approached last year about Fletcher Ventures and his company's multi-million dollar transactions Mr Coppo refused to answer questions and referred journalists working with the BBC and ICIJ to Mr Studhalter. Despite signing a document saying Mr Coppo was the beneficial owner, Mr Studhalter said he had signed it by mistake and produced other records stating that he, not Mr Coppo, was the true owner of Fletcher Ventures. Mr Coppo did not respond to our questions. Fletcher Ventures is not the only company for which Mr Studhalter disputes the paperwork. A leaked document shows Fren Global Corp extended loans worth around $3bn to a company linked to Mr Kerimov and his family that owned shares in Polyus Gold. According to documents signed by Mr Studhalter, he was the beneficial owner of Fren Global Corp. But Mr Studhalter says he sold Fren Global Corp in 2014 ""as a shell company without assets"" to Nariman Gadzhiev, Kerimov's nephew. When asked about the matter, Studhalter claimed not to recognise what he described as a ""distorted electronic signature"" on the document he was shown. Other assets attributed to Swiru Holding and believed to have been owned by Mr Kerimov include a custom-built Boeing 737 and a super-yacht, last valued at $150m. Mr Studhalter says he, not Mr Kerimov was the real owner. Mr Kerimov did not respond to requests to comment apart from in relation to the French investigation. Mr Gadzhiev did not respond to the letter sent him by the BBC. On 8 April, the EU imposed sanctions on Mr Kerimov's son Said Kerimov, who has stood down from the board of Polyus Gold.The revelation that his daughter now owns the French villas may make the properties the target of sanctions in France. And in a statement last week, the French prosecutor in Nice responsible for the cases for which Mr Kerimov and Mr Studhalter were formally indicted, drew our attention ""to the fact that the procedure remains in progress"". In other words it is still an open case. Additional reporting by Will Dahlgreen and Anthony Reuben "
725,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-61071163,2022-04-11T14:43:10,Marina Ovsyannikova: German outlet hires Russian protester," A German media outlet has hired dissident Russian journalist Marina Ovsyannikova as a correspondent. She will work for the company which owns Die Welt newspaper, reporting from Ukraine and Russia, it announced. Last month Ms Ovsyannikova staged a protest on Russian television, storming her Channel One employer's live broadcast with an anti-war placard. The 43-year-old was detained and fined by a Russian court, and made international headlines. She will now work as a freelance correspondent for Die Welt, writing for its flagship German newspaper and appearing as a contributor on a TV news channel it owns. Die Welt ""stands for what is being defended so vehemently by the courageous people on the ground in Ukraine right now: for freedom,"" Ms Ovsyannikova said. Ulf Porschardt, who is editor-in-chief of Welt Group, said that Ms Ovsyannikova's on-air protest ""defended the most important journalistic ethics - despite the threat of state repression"". ""I am excited to be working with her,"" he added. After the March protest, Ms Ovsyannikova said she was prevented from sleeping for two days and questioned for 14 hours, before being issued with a 30,000 rouble (£214, $280) fine in relation to an anti-war video message she had posted online. In the video, she called on the Russian people to protest against the war, saying only they have the power to ""stop all this madness"". After the protest, the journalist left her job as an editor at the Russian state-controlled Channel One, and announced that she would not be accepting an offer of asylum in France, because she wanted to stay in Russia even though she feared for her safety. Ms Ovsyannikova could still face further prosecution under Russian law, risking years in prison under a new penal code which criminalises spreading ""fake news"" about the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Russia recently made it illegal to call the war an ""invasion,"" with Russian state-controlled news organisations instead told to describe it as a ""special military operation."" "
726,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-61021388,2022-04-11T14:24:46,Ukraine conflict: Why is Russia losing so many tanks?," It is thought that Russia has lost hundreds of tanks within two months of invading Ukraine. Military experts put the losses down to the advanced anti-tank weapons which western nations have given to Ukraine, and to the poor way Russia has used its tanks. Ukraine's armed forces say Russia has lost more than 680 tanks. Meanwhile, Oryx - a military and intelligence blog which counts Russia's military losses in Ukraine on the basis of photographs sent from the war zone - says Russia has lost more than 460 tanks and over 2,000 other armoured vehicles. According to the Rand Corporation and the IISS (International Institute for Strategic Studies), Russia had about 2,700 main battle tanks in total at the start of the conflict. The US supplied Ukraine with 2,000 Javelin anti-tank missiles at the start of the conflict and has since sent at least 2,000 more. Javelins can be fired so that the missile explodes on the top of a tank, where the armour is weakest, according to manufacturer Lockheed Martin. A lot of Russian tanks are fitted with reactive armour which absorbs the impact of missiles. However, Javelins are fitted with two warheads. One blows away the reactive armour, and the second pierces the chassis underneath. The UK has also sent at least 3,600 Next Generation Light Anti-tank Weapon missiles (NLAW). These are also designed to explode as they pass over the relatively exposed turret top of tanks. ""Javelin and NLAW are very potent,"" says Nick Reynolds, research analyst in land warfare at the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI). ""Without this lethal aid, the situation in Ukraine would be very different."" The US is supplying Ukraine with 100 Switchblade anti-tank drones. Known as ""kamikaze"" drones, they can hover over a target miles away from the operator and then drop on top of a tank, destroying it with the warhead at their tip. Nowadays, the Russian army operates through Battalion Tactical Groups (BTGs), which are self-contained combat units made up of tanks, infantry and artillery. The precise composition of these units may vary, but generally they comprise a large number of armoured vehicles but relatively few infantry troops. ""Russia has relatively few troops to call on,"" says Phillips O'Brien, a professor of strategic studies at St Andrews University, ""so BTGs are a way of creating a fighting unit with lots of punch. ""They're designed to attack quickly with lots of firepower. However, they have very little protection in terms of infantry personnel to escort them and to retaliate if the armoured column comes under attack,"" he says. ""That makes the Russian army like a boxer who has a great right hook and a glass jaw."" Prof O'Brien says a lack of Russian air patrols means Ukrainian troops have found it easy to get into positions to ambush Russian tank columns. ""Russia didn't get air supremacy at the start of the conflict,"" he says, ""and so they cannot patrol the skies, spotting Ukrainian army movements. ""That means Ukrainian troops have been able to get into good fire positions for ambushes, and they have been able to do a lot of damage this way."" According to Oryx's figures, half of the tanks Russia has lost have not been destroyed or damaged by the enemy but have been captured or abandoned. Experts put this down to logistical failures, and incompetence by Russian troops. ""You've seen pictures of Russian tanks being dragged off by Ukrainian farmers' tractors,"" says Prof O'Brien. ""Some of those tanks were abandoned because they ran out of fuel. That's a logistical failure. Some got stuck in the springtime mud, because the high command invaded at the wrong time of year."" ""Russia's ground forces are made up of a lot of conscripts and recruits. That makes them, in world terms, a low to medium-quality fighting force,"" says RUSI's Nick Reynolds. ""Many tanks have been abandoned because of bad driving. Some have been driven off bridges. Others have been driven into ditches so that the tracks have come off. The ability of the troops to use their equipment has been lacking. ""But often, soldiers have simply abandoned their vehicles and fled. So the will to fight has also been lacking."" The Ukrainian government has even issued instructions on how citizens should turn in abandoned military vehicles. Authorities also confirmed that anyone who found such ""combat trophies"" did not need to declare them for tax purposes. "
727,https://www.bbc.com/news/60981238,2022-04-11T13:57:13,Bucha killings: Satellite image of bodies site contradicts Russian claims," A satellite image of Bucha in Ukraine appears to show bodies lying in the street nearly two weeks before the Russians left the town. The image from 19 March, first reported by the New York Times and confirmed by the BBC, directly contradicts Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov's claim that footage of bodies in Bucha, that has emerged in recent days, was ""staged"" after the Russians withdrew. The satellite image shows objects that appear to be bodies in the exact locations where they were subsequently found by Ukrainian forces when they regained control of the town north of Kyiv. Along another section of the road, the image shows what appear to be more bodies on the ground. There is an earlier satellite image available from Maxar on 11 March. It appears to show bodies in the same locations but is less clear than the one on 19 March. Russia has made a series of unfounded claims relating to images from Bucha - here's what the evidence tells us. Warning: This piece contains graphic images which some may find upsetting. Russia says its forces withdrew from Bucha on 30 March. The Ukrainians say this happened in the early hours of 31 March. On 1 April, footage was posted filmed from a car driving through the town which showed bodies on either side of a road. Russia has claimed it shows ""fake dead bodies"" and was ""staged"" after its troops left the town. We compared the car footage with the satellite imagery of Bucha from 19 March (when the Russians were in control). In both, there are bodies lying in the same parts of the road (marked in red) and near vehicles (marked in yellow). Pro-Russian social media accounts also circulated a slowed-down version of the footage on the same road, claiming that the arm on one of the bodies moved. The video is grainy but a closer analysis of it shows that what is claimed to be a moving arm, is actually a mark in the bottom right corner of the vehicle's windscreen. We've circled this mark - which looks like a raindrop or a speck of dirt - along with similar marks visible on the windscreen earlier in the video. Another Russian claim focuses on a different part of the footage. The car passes another body, lying next to a pavement with red and yellow stones and shattered brown fencing. As it drives on, the body can be seen briefly in the right-hand wing mirror. Pro-Russian accounts claim the body ""sits up"". But a slowed-down version of the video shows the wing mirror is clearly distorting the reflection of the body, as well as houses in the background. The same effect can be seen in videos of similar wing mirrors posted on the internet. The BBC has matched both bodies from the video (posted on 2 April) with high-resolution photos provided by Getty Images and AFP on 3 April. In the video, the first body is lying on their back near a white and yellow kerb. The pavement to the right is part asphalt and part grass. A silver car can be seen on the pavement with its boot open in front of a white fence. The same car, kerb, pavement and fence are visible in the Getty/AFP image. The second body has a black jacket and what appears to be a bloodied tourniquet or bandage on the right arm. They are lying on their side next to a red and yellow pavement, in front of a shattered brown fence. The black jacket, tourniquet/bandage, pavement and fence all match the photo of the body published by Getty/AFP. A pro-Russian social media account, Rybar, says the Maxar satellite images shown in this article were not taken on 19 March - but on 1 April, the day after Russian forces departed. Russia has made unfounded claims the killings were carried out by Ukrainians, but if the bodies were there on 19 March as the satellite images show, that cannot be the case. At that time Russia controlled the area. Rybar says its conclusions are based on an analysis of shadows from images downloaded from the Maxar database, revealing the date and time at which the photograph was taken. We contacted Maxar, who said it appeared Rybar had used the company's image search tools wrongly, and that if correctly used, the images can clearly be shown to be from 19 March. The BBC has also checked this analysis, comparing images from three separate companies (PlanetLab, Apollo Mapping and Maxar) taken from the available satellite imagery over this period. We've determined that the lengths of the shadows (and therefore the angle of the sun) is consistent with the satellite images having been taken on the morning of 19 March and not on 1 April. Russia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs tweeted: ""It is of particular worry that all the bodies of the people whose images have been published by the Kiev regime are not stiffened after at least four days."" According to the Ukrainian military, the Russians left in the early hours of 31 March. The Russians say they left on 30 March. In the hours after death, bodies go through a process called rigor mortis where muscles contract and stiffen. We asked a forensic pathologist for their opinion on whether a body would be expected to be ""stiffened"" after four days. One who has worked in places including Kosovo and Rwanda on war crimes investigations, who did not want to be named, told the BBC that by four days rigor mortis has ""usually subsided"". The Russian tweet also claimed that the bodies ""have no typical cadaver stains"". It's not clear what this means but the pathologist said the appearance of someone who has died from a gunshot wound or other act of violence will vary widely depending on the weapon used, from what distance they were shot and so on. There isn't always a lot of visible blood as it may pool underneath people or soak into heavy clothing, especially if someone is dressed for cold weather. The tweet could be referring to the fact the blood within your body pools downwards after death as it stops circulating around the body, which can lead the skin to turn reddish or purple. But if someone is lying down, the site of this blood pooling and discolouration may well not be visible from an image alone. The Russian defence ministry claimed that while Bucha was under Russian control ""not a single local resident has suffered from any violent action"". This claim, however, contradicts numerous eyewitness accounts from residents. A local teacher told Human Rights Watch on 4 March that Russian forces had rounded up five men and summarily executed one of them. Local residents who spoke to the Russian investigative website The Insider painted a similar picture. ""These were horrific days. When neither your courtyard, your house or even your life belongs to you. There is no electricity, water, gas. It's forbidden to leave the house, if you leave - you get shot,"" local resident Kristina told The Insider. Locals told the BBC that the Russians had systematically broken down doors to loot flats, and, while soldiers stole valuables and food, residents were forced to sit in the cellar. This report was originally published on 5 April and has since been updated.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters that ""the alliance remains a tool geared towards confrontation"". It comes as US defence officials said Moscow's invasion of Ukraine has been a ""massive strategic blunder"" which is likely to bring Nato enlargement. US officials expect the Nordic neighbours to bid for membership of the alliance, potentially as early as June. Washington is believed to support the move which would see the Western alliance grow to 32 members. US State Department officials said last week that discussions had taken place between Nato leaders and foreign ministers from Helsinki and Stockholm. Before it launched its invasion, Russia demanded that the alliance agree to halt any future enlargement, but the war has led to the deployment of more Nato troops on its eastern flank and a rise in public support for Swedish and Finnish membership. Finnish MPs are expected to receive a security report from intelligence officials this week, and Prime Minister Sanna Marin said she expects her government ""will end the discussion before midsummer"" on whether to make a membership application. Finland shares a 1,340km (830 miles) long border with Russia and has been rattled by the invasion of Ukraine. And Sweden's ruling Social Democratic party, which has traditionally opposed Nato membership, said it is rethinking this position in light of Russia's attack on its western neighbour. Party secretary Tobias Baudin told local media that the Nato review should be complete within the next few months. ""When Russia invaded Ukraine, Sweden's security position changed fundamentally,"" the party said in a statement on Monday. But Moscow has been clear that it opposes any potential enlargement of the alliance. Mr Peskov warned the bloc ""is not that kind of alliance which ensures peace and stability, and its further expansion will not bring additional security to the European continent"". Last week Mr Peskov said that Russia would have to ""rebalance the situation"" with its own measures were Sweden and Finland to join Nato. And in February Maria Zakharova, Russia's foreign ministry spokeswoman, warned of ""military and political consequences"" if the countries joined the bloc. Nato was formed in 1949 to counter the threat of Soviet expansion, though since the fall of the Berlin wall a number of formerly communist eastern European countries have joined. Member states agree to come to one another's aid in the event of an armed attack against any individual member state. Despite the threats, both countries have pushed ahead with their bids and stepped up defence spending. On Monday, army leaders in Helsinki announced a new plan to allocate €14m (£10.88m) to purchase drones for Finland's military. And last month Swedish officials said they would boost defence spending by three billion kronas ($317m; £243m) in 2022. "

The current favourites to win next month's song contest were given special permission to leave the country to perform gigs in Tel Aviv and Amsterdam. Speaking to Radio 1 Newsbeat, frontman Oleh Psiuk says he can ""personally feel"" the prime minister's support in the war against Russia. The band are now preparing to return to Ukraine later this week. Men of fighting age haven't been allowed to leave Ukraine, with the majority of those fleeing being women and children. ""Representing Ukraine at this difficult time of war, I want to do my best to be yet another mouthpiece for Ukraine,"" Oleh tells Newsbeat after performing for around 5,000 Eurovision fans in Amsterdam on the weekend. Travelling to Israel and The Netherlands in the run-up to the song contest has been a ""striking contrast,"" he explains. ""People here are not worried at all and it's quite unusual. Many people may see everything that has been happening as a kind of a war movie, but it is very tough when it is happening to you and your family. ""When you wake up in the morning, not being sure if your family and friends are still alive."" As well as performing for Eurovision fans, Kalush Orchestra have been using their short promo tour to meet refugees. ""We believe our mission is to support people while we are here,"" Oleh says. ""If all join efforts and do what they can I think the war will be over soon and will not begin in other countries."" Following Boris Johnson's visit, Downing Street say the UK will send 120 armoured vehicles and anti-ship missile systems to support Ukraine. The prime minister referenced ""President Zelensky's resolute leadership and the invincible heroism and courage of the Ukrainian people"" while on a visit to Kyiv.

The ministers' annual meeting - known as the 2+2 Dialogue - was launched in 2018 to deepen co-operation between the two countries. The forum has focused on improving bilateral relations and co-operation in Asia. It is also seen as part of Washington's strategy to help India become a counterweight to China in the region. The two nations have largely been on the same page - at least in their public statements - on most issues of mutual concern. But it's not business as usual this time because of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Delhi's press release ahead of the talks included the usual line about strengthening the ""comprehensive global strategic partnership"" between the two countries. But Washington's statement mentioned ""mitigating the destabilising impacts of Russia's war against Ukraine"", suggesting that the US will again nudge India - perhaps not too hard - to take a stronger position on Moscow. India and the US have had differing views over Ukraine since the war began in February. While Delhi has used strong words to comment on the invasion, it hasn't directly criticised Moscow. It has also abstained from all UN votes against Russia. India has also been trying to find ways to circumvent banking sanctions on Moscow to take advantage of discounted oil prices offered by Russian firms. India's stand of non-alignment also stems from its own geopolitical needs. Moscow is Delhi's time-tested ally and also its largest supplier of defence equipment - accounting for more than 50% of its imports. A former Indian diplomat said Delhi's stand has put Washington in a Catch-22 situation. The US wants India to be part of its wider strategy of isolating Russia but at the same time, it can't afford to weaken India against China - both diplomatically and militarily. Experts say this has created confusion in the White House about the best way to deal with India. Washington has not directly criticised India but has issued statements that experts call ""mild warnings"". After Mr Modi refrained from criticising Russia during a recent meeting of the Quad - which also includes Australia, the US and Japan - on Ukraine, Mr Biden said India's stand on the war was ""somewhat shaky"". His top economic adviser Brian Deese later said India had been informed that the consequences of a ""more explicit strategic alignment"" with Moscow would be ""significant and long-term"". But this didn't deter India as it once against abstained from the vote that suspended Russia from the UN Human Rights Council. Other US officials, including US Deputy National Security Adviser for International Economics Daleep Singh, have appeared to be more understanding of India's stand. While Mr Biden and Mr Modi are likely to focus on bilateral ties, Ukraine still looms large over the meeting. It will also be on the agenda when Indian Foreign Minister S Jaishankar and Defence Minister Rajnath Singh meet their US counterparts Antony Blinken and Lloyd Austin on Monday. Both sides have been clear about their differing stands on Ukraine but there is too much at stake to risk their bilateral relationship. Washington sees India as an ally to challenge China's dominance in the Asia-Pacific region. Both countries also believe that there is massive untapped potential in bilateral trade. They have the ambitious target of taking bilateral trade - which was at $113bn in 2021 - to $500bn in the future. India also needs the US to help diversify its defence portfolio and reduce its reliance on Russian arms. Moscow continues to be India's largest arms supplier even though its share has dropped to 49% from 70%. The US was India's second-largest supplier between 2011 and 2015 after Russia, but fell behind France and Israel in the period between 2016 and 2021. Both Washington and Delhi would want to improve on these statistics. But the elephant in the room will continue to be India's purchase of the S-400 missile defence system from Russia - a deal which gives India strategic deterrence against both China and Pakistan. The agreement has come under the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (Caatsa), which was introduced in 2017 to target Russia, Iran and North Korea with economic and political sanctions. It also prohibits any country from signing defence deals with these nations. The US had sanctioned China for buying the same system in 2018. But so far, it has been evasive about doing the same for India. It had refrained from sanctioning India even after the country started receiving the first deliveries of the S-400 in December last year. But the Ukraine war will now further complicate the situation. Some US officials have said in the past that there was no guarantee that India would get a waiver. Now, in the fast-changing geopolitical scenario, both Washington and Delhi would not want to publicly take stands against each other. But when the defence ministers meet, the S-400 and the issue of sanctions will definitely come up. How the two countries deal with this and their other differences will determine the future course of Washington-Delhi ties. "

Millions of people have viewed posts committed to portraying President Vladimir Putin as smiling, benevolent and peace-loving. These are Putin's superfans - and we've been tracking what they do and where they come from. The BBC has been investigating these huge pro-Putin groups with the help of researchers from the Institute for Strategic Dialogue (ISD). ISD experts identified 10 pro-Putin public groups, boasting names such as Vladimir Putin - Leader of the Free World. The groups have more than 650,000 members between them. Content includes photos and messages praising the Russian leader, written in a number of languages, including English, Russian, Farsi, Arabic and Khmer. Not only are they popular, but they are very active. Over the past month, researchers counted 16,500 posts, receiving more than 3.6 million interactions. The overall aim of the groups seems to be to promote Mr Putin as a hero standing up to the West, with overwhelming international support. The images often show the Russian leader ""walking confidently, holding puppies, staring longingly into the camera, saluting troops, and riding an array of wild animals, including bears and lions"". These groups have gained more than 100,000 new members since the start of the invasion on 24 February. Digging into the details of the people driving most of the content, it emerged that many of the fans listed as administrators of the groups have duplicate accounts under the same name. The researchers found at least 100 such accounts in the network. These accounts generally follow each other and sometimes post heart-warming messages or send heart emojis to each other. And they administer these pro-Putin accounts alongside others pretending to be the Russian Federation or the Russian security services, which are clearly fake. Running duplicate accounts is a potential violation of Facebook's rules on inauthentic behaviour, the ISD says. Lead researcher Moustafa Ayad calls the practice an example of ""astroturfing"" - an online operation involving multiple accounts that falsely gives something the impression of wider grassroots support. The campaign ""creates the appearance of widespread support for Putin and the Kremlin in the shadow of the invasion and relies on... inauthentic accounts to accomplish its goal"", according to the ISD report. A closer examination of some of the group admins shows some unusual activity. One, named Marine, who says her location is Syria, uses three separate accounts to generate support for the president. Her three accounts, in Arabic, post at the same time every day. Another moderator, Victoria, from Cambodia, has been pushing content in a Khmer language group. Since 4 February, her posts have generated more than 34,000 reactions and have been shared more than 4,000 times. And Marine and Victoria jointly run a Khmer-language Facebook page, part of a wider pattern of co-ordination between some of the accounts. Posts are widely shared across different groups. For instance, another account listed as located in Bulgaria posted the same Putin image 12 times in the space of a couple of minutes. We tried to contact the people behind all of these accounts for comment, but didn't have much luck. But a man in Kenya, called Raj, who's in several of these groups and includes ""Putin"" at the end of his name on Facebook, did answer the phone when we rang. In a brief conversation, he called the president a ""great leader"" but said he didn't want to discuss the war. We emailed him further questions about his interest in Russia, but he didn't respond. Hasmik, from Armenia, says she's a journalist and now helps to run six pro-Putin groups. We asked who invited her to do it. She told us it was the people already running the groups and said that she wasn't paid for her efforts. It's difficult to glean the motivations of the people behind the accounts. There is no obvious link to the Russian government and unlike other well-known Russian disinformation campaigns, the network isn't subtle; nor do the people involved hide their intentions. But we can't rule out the possibility that the network has some links to the Russian authorities or pro-Putin elements inside Russia. Many people around the world are drawn to Mr Putin and his anti-West view of the world. We contacted Facebook, which says it has policies against fake accounts and has suspended a number of accounts based on information from the report and their own investigations. ""We're continuing to take strong action to prevent the spread of misinformation relating to the crisis in Ukraine,"" says a spokesman for parent company Meta. In the course of our research, we came across another interesting phenomenon - Vladimir Putin impersonation accounts. Mr Putin is one of the few world leaders who doesn't use social media, and there's no official Facebook account in his name. He reputedly doesn't even have a smartphone. According to his spokesman, Mr Putin simply ""does not need"" social media as it ""doesn't give him anything he doesn't have already"". But some have filled the gap left by his online absence. The page on Facebook displayed above had more than three million followers until it was taken down for impersonation shortly after the invasion at the end of February. A significant number of its subscribers - more than 700,000 - joined during the pandemic, when the page was talking up Russian-made Covid vaccines. More recently, the page was posting messages amplifying the Kremlin's view of the war, and many commenting on it appeared to believe it contained the genuine words of the Russian president. Shortly after the invasion, a post on the page declared the goal of the ""operation"" was ""peacekeeping... aimed only at the demilitarisation of a neighbouring country"". This message was shared and liked more than 200,000 times. And the page also had a habit of tagging people in its messages about Mr Putin, including users identified by researchers as having duplicate accounts. In other words, it was interacting with the Putin superfans. We don't know who's behind this account. The people managing it are based in Russia and Latvia, according to the page's transparency section. Fan pages are fertile ground to drum up support for the Kremlin internationally, says Nika Aleksejeva, a researcher at the Digital Forensic Research Lab (DFRLab), part of the Atlantic Council think tank. ""They may help to build public support in foreign countries for Russia's so-called 'military operation in Ukraine' unless taken down by mainstream social media platforms,"" she says. DFRLab documented how one Putin-impersonator account posting in Arabic had paid for adverts targeting users in several countries, including Algeria, Libya, Egypt, Yemen, Morocco, Lebanon, and Tunisia. The page had more than one million followers, but has since been deleted. Another prominent Putin page, posted in Arabic, used to be managed by a man who is also a big fan of Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad. It attracted almost a million followers before recently disappearing. "

""I was quite comfortable back home sitting with my cat,"" he says in a strong Belfast accent. Ajay Spence travelled to the war in Ukraine from Northern Ireland a month ago, having first got in touch with the Ukrainian embassy in Dublin. Having told them about his previous experience with the British army in Afghanistan and Iraq, he was soon on his way to Poland before crossing into Ukraine. Seeing the news coverage of the Russian invasion is what spurred Ajay into action. ""It was just too much to watch you know, it's like asking a firefighter to walk past a burning house and not do anything."" Ajay was placed in Ukraine's foreign legion, which is said to have fighters from 50 countries, the largest numbers coming from the UK and the US. His unit were deployed on front line operations in towns around the capital, Kyiv, that saw some of the heaviest fighting, including Irpin and Bucha. They helped to drive the Russian forces out of areas that had been captured. Their duties centred around ""observation missions, advancing, drawing out fire"", he says. Witnessed death ""It's been pretty heavy work at times. It's not like Iraq, that was a guerrilla warfare situation - this is a conventional war situation against mechanised infantry."" But the threat was real. Not long after he arrived on the front lines, two fighters in his unit died in front of him. ""They were killed by indirect fire, one bled to death, the other was killed instantly. We carried one of them, trying to save him, while there was heavy shelling around us."" It was a traumatic experience. So what about the risk to his own life? ""I'm under no illusions about that, I'm willing to accept that. I'm here to do a job which is to help the Ukrainian people. You just think about stuff like that later, and get on with the job in hand."" In the early days of the Russian invasion the position of the UK government on British citizens travelling to fight in Ukraine was unclear, but there have since been warnings to people not to travel. Those like Ajay, who have been placed into the Ukraine's legion of foreign fighters, are paid the same as locals - 11-15,000 UAH (about £300-400) per month in base pay. There can also be additional pay added on top for those that are deployed to the front during active combat. Communication, at least, has been manageable for Ajay thanks to the number of English speakers. And the reception from Ukrainians has been warm. ""When you're out and about people notice you, people come up and shake your hand. I think they need to see things like that because they need to know the world is behind them. ""Ukraine is a lovely country, and to see the destruction and damage, and just the pure hatred that's been thrown against the people here, it's hard to watch. I grew up in Northern Ireland during the Troubles so I've got a bit more empathy towards stuff like that."" With Russia's army having retreated from Kyiv in recent days, Ajay says his unit are being redeployed to a new front line. Their mission - to recapture areas currently under Russian occupation. He surprises me after our interview by sharing a photo of himself dressed in a rather different type of soldier's outfit. Holding a sword instead of the automatic rifle now sitting beside him, Ajay explains he had previously worked as an extra in Game of Thrones which was filmed in Northern Ireland. A rather different battlefield from the one he is now on, and he says he intends to stay in Ukraine until the war winds down. ""When I left Belfast I got rid of my apartment, so I'll be here as long as I need to."" No one knows how long the conflict will last, and there will inevitably be questions about what happens to fighters once they return home to the UK. But for now the international legion says it is proud of its achievements since forming just over a month ago and is advertising on social media for more people to join up. "
737,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-61061619,2022-04-10T23:02:35,War set to cut Ukraine's economy by almost half," Ukraine's economy is set to shrink by almost half this year as a result of the war, the World Bank has said. The institution forecasts Russia's invasion will cause more economic damage across eastern Europe and parts of Asia than the coronavirus pandemic. The conflict in Ukraine has shut half of the country's businesses and slashed exports, the World Bank said. Anna Bjerde, the bank's vice-president, said Ukraine needed ""massive financial support immediately"". The bank has sent almost $1bn of assistance to Ukraine so far and has promised a further $2bn in the coming months. It said the closure of Black Sea shipping from Ukraine had cut off some 90% of the country's grain exports and half of its total exports. Ukraine is the world's biggest exporter of sunflower oil and the shutdown of exports has affected global food prices. The World Bank said the war had made economic activity impossible in large parts of the country, disrupting farming and harvest operations. ""The magnitude of the humanitarian crisis unleashed by the war is staggering. The Russian invasion is delivering a massive blow to Ukraine's economy and it has inflicted enormous damage to infrastructure,"" said Ms Bjerde. The bank said the 45.1% contraction estimate excluded the impact of physical infrastructure destruction, but said this would hamper future economic output further. While Ukraine's economy will suffer the most damage by the war, the World Bank said Russia's economy had been already plunged into a deep recession as a result of sanctions from Western countries. The sanctions have ranged from cutting ties with Russian banks and targeting Russian politicians and oligarchs to banning luxury goods imports and flights. The bank projected Russia's economy would contract by 11.2% in 2022 as the sanctions bite. But while the US has banned all Russian oil and gas imports, the EU, which gets a quarter of its oil and 40% of its gas from Russia, has stopped short of such action. EU countries continue to pay Moscow up to €800m (£674m; $884m) for energy every day, which amounts to an estimated 40% of the Kremlin's income. The EU has proposed a plan to make Europe independent from Russian fossil fuels before 2030. The World Bank said that in addition to Russia and Ukraine, Belarus, the Kyrgyz Republic, Moldova and Tajikistan were projected to fall into recession this year. It said growth projections had been downgraded in all economies because of the war, with weaker-than-expected growth in the euro area. ""The Ukraine war and the pandemic have once again shown that crises can cause widespread economic damage and set back years of per capita income and development gains,"" said Asli Demirgüç-Kunt, World Bank chief economist for Europe and Central Asia.

738,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-61062213,2022-04-10T20:54:08,Ukraine village scarred by aftermath of occupation," The day after Anton Ischenko celebrated his 23rd birthday, he was taken by the Russians, led away at gunpoint from his home in the village of Andriivka, west of Kyiv. His family found his body a month later, once the Russian troops were driven out. He was so badly mutilated that they had to identify him by his clothes. As Russian forces retreat to eastern Ukraine, horrors are being uncovered in the villages which they left. About 1,000 people lived in Andriivka, some 60km away from the capital. At least 40 of them were killed. ""He was a very nice boy, very clever - he recited poetry,"" recalls Anton's grandmother, Tetiana, sitting outside the family house. Suddenly, her exhausted face crumples. ""Maybe if he had gone to fight somewhere else, he would have returned here in one piece,"" she says, struggling to speak through her tears. ""When my husband told the Russians, 'Take me instead,' they pointed a machine gun at him and said, 'Go home - or we will take you both.'"" Andriivka, on the route up to the Belarus border, has been blighted by battle and the month-long occupation. Buildings are ripped apart amid a mess of rubble and mangled metal. Craters lie in the dirt road where tanks were blown up. Remnants of artillery lie beside corpses of chickens and rabbits. Burnt-out armoured vehicles lie at either end of the village. It is a scene of utter devastation. With the Russians pushed out, some residents are beginning to return - or emerge from shelters. On the main road, beside wooden boxes that contained grad missiles, Grigoriy Klymenko is taking in the sight of destruction. He decided to stay throughout the occupation to be with his 90-year-old mother, who is bedridden. They had watched in terror as tanks encircled the village. ""They're animals,"" he says of the forces that moved in. ""Humans don't behave like this. My parents told me about the war and the fascists didn't even do such things."" Next door, Leonid Koval and his son are beginning to repair their damaged house, retiling the roof and fixing plastic sheeting into blown-out windows. Russian soldiers stayed in his home - and looted it. Inside, the cupboards lie wrenched apart by the Russian occupiers, boxes of photographs and clothes turned upside down. Cushions were ripped from the sofa. The soldiers emptied everything they could find. When the Ukrainian army began to push towards Andriivka, the Russians staying there moved out of the main house and into the tiny cellar to hide. Leonid takes me down to the cold and dark space, the mattresses and blankets they used still stuffed against the wall. To one side are the open packets of biscuits and jars of pickled fruit they feasted on. As he surveys the damage to his home, Leonid breaks down. ""I don't know what they were looking for,"" he says, ""they just destroyed everything. I have no words to describe what they did."" The scarred villages and towns near Kyiv and Chernihiv in northern Ukraine, from where the Russians have retreated, are now sites of possible war crimes. Andriivka joins a growing list - with Bucha, Irpin and others - which bear the hallmarks of deliberate targeting of civilians and other atrocities banned by the rules of war. And they are grim omens of what may be in store in the east, where Russian forces are now intensifying their attacks ahead of a new offensive. What nightmares will be found there once the shroud of war finally lifts? On the edge of Andriivka cemetery, the remains of Tetiana's grandson, Anton, lie in a fresh grave. His family have only now been able to bury him. The 23-year-old was studying to become an electrician. ""We wanted to bury him separately and with a priest, not just in a mass grave,"" she says. ""I had two daughters, so he was our boy. We only had one boy."" "

Sunflower Scotland has sent cat and dog food to shelters in Dnipro, to help the animals left behind by owners who were killed or forced to flee. It has raised more than £30,000 and dispatched supplies including clothes, medicine, camping gear and baby boxes. The group's partners in Eastern Ukraine deliver the aid to towns most in need. Sunflower Scotland was set by Scottish volunteers with families in Ukraine. Secretary Anastasia Bombrys told BBC Scotland the public response was ""amazing"" after the organisation started fundraising following the Russian invasion. While its focus is on humanitarian aid, Ms Bombrys said many people had asked them if they could donate pet food. She added: ""A lot of people tried to take their animals but there were huge queues for trains and buses so not everybody was able to do that. ""Only those who travelled by car were able to take pets."" Ms Bombrys said there were also many dogs and cats that no longer had a home as their owners had been killed. Pet food has been sent to the Ulublena Dvornyaga and Zvezdniy shelters in Dnipro Over the last month Sunflower Scotland has built up a network extending from Edinburgh to Lanarkshire, Glasgow, Falkirk and Aberdeen. The group sends aid directly to Lviv in Ukraine rather than Poland. Among its other aid efforts are a bakery which donated two tonnes of flour which will soon be transported to Ukraine. Sewing tape from Scotland is also being sent to help make ammo vests for civilian volunteers. Once they reach Lviv, supplies are loaded onto smaller vehicles to make distribution easier in the areas worst hit by the conflict. Sunflower Scotland's most recent fundraising event was a bake sale at Starbucks in Fountain Park, Edinburgh, on Sunday. Ms Bombrys, who has Ukrainian and Belarusian heritage, says the news pictures from Ukraine have compelled to help the humanitarian crisis She said: ""I have childhood memories of travelling from Minsk to my grandparents' home in Kremenchuk. ""Now along that 800km route you see absolute devastation to places and people's lives."" "

The vehicles, formerly used to transport valuable items like diamonds, were bought with donations organised by two Gloucester City Council members. The trucks are stacked ""top to bottom"" with items such as combat tourniquets, mine detection kits and bullet proof vests for people in the country.

Baroness Ilora Finlay of Llandaff has been waiting three weeks for visas for a mother and two children to be cleared through the Homes for Ukraine scheme. She and her husband have already prepared their Cardiff home for them. The UK government said it was working ""as quickly as possible, but accept progress has not been quick enough"". Baroness Finlay told the PA news agency she did not wish to identify the refugee family but said they were known to her and her husband, Prof Andrew Finlay, before the Russian invasion. She said visa issues are causing uncertainty and adding to refugees' trauma. She said the father of the family is a doctor in Ukraine who had worked with her husband and remained in Kyiv. They have also submitted an application for him in the event he also leaves Ukraine due to injury or other reasons. Prof Finlay spent eight hours filling out forms for their visa applications on 18 March, the day the scheme launched. ""We've said we will do whatever is needed for however long to support them, and we know that it might be years,"" said Baroness Finlay. She explained that each of the four visa applications have been processed individually, which has made her concerned they may not be approved together. Despite repeated efforts in person at a visa information centre and over the phone, she said the only information she has received has been four separate emails to say each applicant is ""in the system"" to be processed - which arrived on Thursday. ""The silence is awful... nobody can help me find out what's happened to these people's applications,"" she said. ""I think there is a failure of recognition that this uncertainty is adding to the trauma that these people have already experienced. ""The message from the system is that the country is not welcoming them."" The couple have bought an extra bed and fridge, among other things, for the family, clearing space in their kitchen cupboards so they can have space to cook their own meals. A government spokesperson said: ""The Home Office has made changes to visa processing - the application form has been streamlined, Ukrainian passport holders can now apply online and do their biometrics checks once in the UK, and greater resource has gone into the system.""

The Barley-McMullens, described the couple, who were not being named, as ""scared but strong"", but there were stumbling blocks. Sarah said: ""They are not allowed to legally get married in Ukraine so we have had to sign a form to say we are willing to take an unmarried couple. ""And one of them is Russian so, when she applied for a visa, her passport was taken away from her."" Would-be sponsors of refugees have criticised bureaucracy and delay in the Homes For Ukraine scheme. The government has confirmed only a quarter of the 41,000 Ukrainians already granted visas have reached the UK. But Sarah said they are doing all they can to keep the couple's spirits up. ""We've done a few FaceTimes with them, so we have spoken face to face, and there are always lots of tears because they can't believe we want them to come and live with us,"" she said. ""The Russian army told them that they wouldn't be welcomed by anybody and we are just proving them wrong."" Sarah said she was looking forward to hosting them. She said: ""I have no idea how they will feel but our plan is just to get them here and that is what we are focussing on. ""Then we will give them the space and tools they will need to start trying to recover."" Follow BBC East Midlands on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram. Send your story ideas to eastmidsnews@bbc.co.uk.

Jacob and Oliver go to singing lessons together in Wolverhampton and were inspired to adapt the song. They aimed to raise £500 for the DEC Ukraine Humanitarian Appeal which they have achieved. The boys have been offered the chance to perform their song at The Beatles Story museum in Liverpool. The eight-year-olds adapted the lyrics to one of the quartet's best known songs to reflect the war in Ukraine and posted a video on YouTube, attracting hundreds of views. Beatles fan Jacob, who also played the piano in their recording, said the song ""has quite a good tune and we thought we could change the lyrics to it to make something new"". Their adapted lyrics include the line: ""Families parted, broken hearted, children crying in the street... there must be an answer, let them be."" ""We wanted to help children that have been affected by the war,"" said Jacob. News of their fundraising efforts reached The Beatles Story museum in Liverpool, who responded by offering the boys tickets and a chance to perform their song at the museum. Jacob's mum Emma said she was very proud. ""They've worked really hard, they're both really busy but they found time to practise and make sure it's as good as it can be,"" she said. ""They've got quite an ambitious goal, £500 is a big target for two 8-year-old boys. It's something they can be really proud of when they're older.""

Dr Andrei Illarionov said Russia ""did not take seriously"" other countries' threats to reduce their energy usage. Despite trying to reduce its reliance on Russian sources, Europe is continuing to buy oil and gas. Last year, soaring prices meant oil and gas revenues accounted for 36% of Russia's government spending. Much of that income comes from the European Union, which imports about 40% of its gas and 27% of its oil from Russia. This week, its top diplomat Josep Borrell said ""a billion [euros] is what we pay Putin every day for the energy he supplies us"". Dr Illarionov said if Western countries ""would try to implement a real embargo on oil and gas exports from Russia... I would bet that probably within a month or two, Russian military operations in Ukraine, probably will be ceased, will be stopped"". ""It's one of the very effective instruments still in the possession of the Western countries,"" he added. While the oil and gas trade has continued during the conflict, widespread sanctions mean that a lot of other economic activity has stopped, many foreign companies have pulled out and exports have been disrupted. One recent survey by Russia's own central bank even forecasts the economy will shrink by 8% this year, while the International Institute of Finance says it could fall by as much as 15%. Dr Illarionov suggested that President Putin was prepared to endure a hit to the economy that shows where his priorities lie. ""His territorial ambitions, his imperial ambitions, are much more important than anything else, including the livelihood of the Russian population and of the financial situation in the country... even the financial state of the his government,"" he said. Last week, amid tensions with Europe over how gas would be paid for, President Putin said that ""key indicators"" of the health of the Russian economy include the ""creation of jobs, the reduction of poverty and inequality, the improvement of the quality of life of people, the availability of goods and services"". World Bank figures suggest that almost 20 million Russians live in poverty. President Putin has, in recent years, pledged to halve that number. Now Dr Illarionov said ""we'll see probably doubling the number of those people, maybe even tripling"" as the economy struggles. The Moscow-based think tank, the Centre for Strategic Research, estimated two million jobs could be lost this year as the unemployment rate rises from a record low. Those concerns are shared by Vladimir Milov, who is a former Russian deputy energy minister, but is now part of Alexei Navalny's Russia of the Future opposition party. ""Many people are concerned about losing their jobs, I think it's just that the majority does not really realise the severity of the economic situation,"" he said. Inflation, which has already risen to 15.7% because of the war, means people might stop spending money on things such as gyms and meals in restaurants and ""that's bad news for a lot of small businesses"", said Mr Milov. Some basic food items such as sugar, onions and cabbages have risen in price by more than 40% since the start of this year. Mr Milov said any noticeable falls in living standards would help his party's cause as an opposition. ""We have been explaining to people all along [that] Putin's policy would lead Russia into a catastrophe, including a complete social and economic catastrophe, including [a] deterioration of living standards that we haven't seen in decades,"" he said. ""I have to say that comes at an extremely high price. We would prefer not to see what is happening today."" However Mr Milov, who fled to Lithuania last year, thinks it will take time for falling living standards to translate to political change. ""Russia is a country with big inertia in society, and a lot of fear instigated by the authorities. Specifically people really are very much afraid of protesting because right now they can end up in jail for a long, long time for doing that"". He added: ""But I would say [that within a] few months [of] real deep economic trouble, that we haven't seen in 30 years, it will change the mood of the society. More people will start to speak out loudly."" President Putin's former adviser Dr Andrei Illarionov, who now lives in the United States, said a change of government is inevitable ""sooner or later"". He said ""it is absolutely impossible to have any positive future for Russia, with the current political regime"". Under President Putin, he suggested, ""there is no way that country might be integrated back into the international relations, in the world economy"". You can watch Dr Andrei Illarionov and Vladimir Milov's interviews on Talking Business with Aaron Heslehurst this weekend. Viewers in the UK can watch the show on BBC iPlayer.

749,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-61051307,2022-04-09T23:05:53,Ukraine: Three ways this war could escalate and drag Nato in," Nato ministers have been meeting in Brussels this past week to discuss how far they should go in providing military equipment to Ukraine. The challenge for Nato throughout this war has been how to give its ally Ukraine enough military support to defend itself without getting drawn into the conflict and finding itself at war with Russia. The Ukrainian government has been explicit in its calls for help. If it is to have any chance of fending off the coming Russian assault on the Donbas region in the east of the country, it says, then it urgently needs a resupply of the West's Javelin, NLAW (next-generation light anti-tank weapon), Stinger and Starstreak anti-tank and anti-aircraft missiles that its forces have already been using to such effect in this war. That much is coming. But Ukraine wants more. It wants tanks, warplanes, drones and advanced missile air defence systems to counter Russia's increasing use of air strikes and long-range missiles that are steadily depleting Ukraine's strategic stores of fuel and other essentials. So what exactly, many people may ask, is holding Nato back? The answer is escalation. The risk of Russia resorting to using tactical (ie short range) nuclear weapons or of the conflict spreading beyond Ukraine's borders into a wider European war is constantly in the backs of western leaders' minds and here the stakes are dangerously high. President Putin reminded the world early on in this war that Russia is a nuclear weapons power and that he was moving its strategic nuclear deterrent up to a higher degree of readiness. The US did not follow suit as it detected no movement of Russian nuclear warheads out of their secure storage bunkers. But Putin's point was made. He was effectively saying: ""Russia has a massive nuclear arsenal so don't think you can push us around."" Russian military doctrine allows for the early use of low-yield, tactical nuclear warheads on the battlefield, knowing that the West has an abhorrence for nuclear weapons that have not been used in anger for 77 years. Nato strategic planners worry that once the nuclear taboo is broken, even if the damage is limited to a localised target on the Ukrainian battlefield, then the risk of escalation to a catastrophic nuclear exchange between Russia and the West inevitably goes up a notch. And yet, with every atrocity apparently committed by Russian soldiers, Nato's resolve stiffens and its inhibitions melt away. The Czech Republic has already sent tanks, admittedly outdated Soviet-era T72s, but they are the first Nato country to do so. Slovakia is sending its S300 air defence missile systems. Both such moves would have seemed improbably risky when this war began. Tobias Ellwood MP, who chairs Parliament's Defence Committee, is one of those who believes Putin is bluffing when he raises the spectre of nuclear weapons and that Nato should be doing more. 'We have been over-cautious in the weapons systems we have been willing to provide,"" he says. ""We need a more robust attitude. We're giving the Ukrainians enough to survive but not to win and that must change."" So how exactly could this Russia-Ukraine war escalate into a wider pan-European conflict that drags in Nato? There are a number of potential scenarios which will doubtless be occupying minds in Western defence ministries. Here are just three of them: 1. A Nato-supplied anti-ship missile fired by Ukrainian forces in Odesa hits and sinks a Russian warship offshore in the Black Sea with the loss of nearly 100 sailors and dozens of marines. A death toll of this magnitude in a single strike would be unprecedented and Putin would be under pressure to respond in some form. 2. A Russian strategic missile strike targets a supply convoy of military hardware crossing from a Nato country, like Poland or Slovakia, into Ukraine. If casualties were sustained on Nato's side of the border that could potentially trigger Article 5 of Nato's constitution, bringing the entire alliance to the defence of the country attacked. 3. Amidst fierce fighting in the Donbas an explosion occurs at an industrial facility resulting in the release of toxic chemical gases. While this has already occurred, there were no deaths reported. But were it to result in the sort of mass casualties seen in Syria's use of poison gas at Ghouta and if it were found to have been deliberately caused by Russian forces, then Nato would be obliged to respond. It is perfectly possible that none of these scenarios will materialise. But while Western nations have displayed a rare degree of unity in the strength of their reaction to Russia's invasion, there are suggestions that they are being merely reactive and not thinking through what the endgame should be. ""The bigger strategic question,"" says one of Britain's most experienced military officers who asks not to be named, ""is whether our government is engaged in crisis management or actual strategy."" That would require thinking this through to the finish, he adds. ""What we are trying to achieve here is to give Ukraine every bit of help we can, short of World War Three. The problem is, Putin is a better poker player than we are."" Tobias Ellwood MP agrees. ""Russia does this [the threat of escalation] very effectively. And we are spooked. We have lost the ability to control the escalatory ladder."" "
750,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-61036880,2022-04-09T23:04:18,Chernihiv: Are these Russia's weapons of war?," There have been urgent calls for investigations into allegations of war crimes in previously Russian-held areas of Ukraine after shocking footage of murdered civilians. But there are wider questions over whether widespread Russian attacks on civilian targets amount to war crimes. We've been looking at a series of attacks in one city - Chernihiv - to see whether they are consistent with Russian tactics across Ukraine and reveal something of their strategy. The following report contains some graphic details. ""They were shooting at us with everything they had,"" says Diana, 20. Within minutes of encountering the Russian tank, half her family would be dead. Diana, her mother Irina, her partner Sasha and his little brother Maxim were fleeing Chernihiv on 9 March after weeks of shelling. They had one simple aim - to reach safety in the west of the country, where relatives were waiting for them. But within minutes of leaving the city heading south they were plunged into danger. As their Volkswagen Golf passed the village of Kolychivka, Sasha saw Russian tanks ahead. One fired at them immediately. He put his foot down, hoping to accelerate through the danger zone - and then the car stalled. The firing continued, and Sasha shouted for them get out - but 15-year-old Maxim had already been hit. There was a hole in his chest and blood coming from his mouth. Diana, Sasha and Irina crawled into bushes - but soldiers were approaching, shouting to each other, asking where the family were hiding. Bullets cracked towards them. Diana's foot was seriously injured. Sasha tried to bandage it, but then as he turned to help Irina, the horror worsened. ""Irina opened her jacket and we realised that there was nothing to bandage,"" Diana told BBC News. ""A part of her abdomen and intestines had been shot through."" They heard more shooting and Diana turned to Sasha believing these were their final minutes. ""We had time to say that we loved each other,"" she said. ""I asked Sasha, 'Are we going to die here?' He said, 'Probably'. ""My mum crawled with us a little more. I kept turning and saying, 'Mum, crawl, please, please'. She said, 'Yes, yes'. And then she [lay] down on the ground. She died there."" Diana kept crawling, following Sasha as he broke a path for her through the thicket. They went past a burning field and through the forest. Diana and Sasha survived and she made it to a hospital. She has lost four toes from her left foot. Diana has no doubt the attackers were Russian because of their accents, uniforms and the Z symbol daubed on one of the tanks. The BBC's verification team has found no evidence of any legitimate military targets near the site of the attack. Attacks on civilians in cars elsewhere Water is the most basic of human necessities and there is evidence of deliberate Russian targeting of the supply in Chernihiv. A pumping station on the outskirts of the city was hit on 14 March. The attack badly damaged a water reservoir and destroyed a control room, according to the head of the water company in Chernihiv, Serhiy Malyavko, who said a worker at the plant - along with three family members - were killed. The family was sheltering there after their home was destroyed by shelling. Satellite imagery shows the damage to the plant, located by Twitter user @obretix in a forested area far away from other buildings. Photos released by the water company showed a severely damaged treatment tank with small craters in the ground. Damage that looks like shrapnel holes pepper the buildings. The sequence of craters visible in a satellite image suggests ground-launched strikes, says Wim Zwijnenburg, an arms researcher at Pax, a Dutch peace organisation. ""The shrapnel impact and blast direction seem to indicate the missiles were fired from the west of the water facility, [which] corresponds with the presence of Russian troop movements located to the west, according to public data on their locations."" Without access to the site itself, the experts we've spoken to say it's not possible to be precise about the weapons used. Rather than missiles, the damage may have been caused by heavy guns or mortars. The head of the water company says the site was struck three days in a row. ""There was no military target. I'm 100% sure that the Russian troops have been destroying the city's infrastructure so that there would be no gas, no electricity or water supply in the city,"" Mr Malyavko told BBC News. He said two other facilities elsewhere were also destroyed, cutting off water to most of the city's population. The rules of war ban premeditated attacks on targets indispensable to civilian life, such as water supplies. ""This has been done to make the population panic,"" says Mr Malyavko. ""And Russia is probably hoping that if there's a humanitarian catastrophe, the local authorities will agree to start negotiations - and that the city will surrender."" Attacks on water elsewhere It was the morning of 16 March, and Ukrainian journalist Alina Klimenko received news of a much-needed bread delivery to the city. Her father, Vitalii, dashed to join the queue. But after a short while he moved away as a nearby house came under fire. Others, now used to the sound of shelling in the city, stayed. And then the queue itself was hit. Alina ran out to film the aftermath. Her footage showed bodies on the ground and an ambulance racing to the scene. At least 14 civilians died, according to Ukrainian authorities. We have confirmed the authenticity of Alina's video and located it to a residential area in the city. Alina's father, who has a military background, says the incoming fire was from the north-east, consistent with the attack being launched by Russian units operating several kilometres to the north of Chernihiv, according to the mapping team at the Institute for the Study of War (ISW). Weapons expert Mark Cancian looked at the BBC's research. He said the damage was consistent with the impact of a missile with a range of up to 30km (19 miles). A satellite image from 16 March shows Russian forces with this kind of weaponry 14km north-east of the city. The US Embassy in Kyiv initially wrongly reported that Russian forces in the city had shot dead the civilians. This was quickly denied by Moscow who said no Russian troops were present in the city. But the Russians went further, saying the event had either been staged, or that those killed were victims of ""Ukrainian nationalists"". There have been numerous examples of this type of denial from the Russian government. Russian denial of responsibility elsewhere A critical factor in any prosecution for war crimes is obtaining clear evidence of a deliberate intent to target civilians. Images and eye-witness statements can be the starting point, says Prof Alex Whiting, a former investigations co-ordinator at the International Criminal Court. But investigators would then need to tackle a series of basic questions: Throughout the conflict, the Ukrainian intelligence services have been releasing allegedly intercepted communications between Russian forces. In one, a man with a Russian accent can be heard being ordered to shoot at a civilian car. The authenticity of these conversations has not been verified by the BBC. But by building a picture of consistent patterns of behaviour, the case for prosecution becomes stronger. Sareta Ashraph, an expert in human-rights law, says investigators would be looking to establish these patterns of behaviour across the country - whether water facilities, hospitals or supermarkets had been regularly hit - in order to build up a picture of military strategy. ""This can show evidence of deliberate targeting, where the intent to bring the civilian population to its knees becomes much clearer,"" she says. As the war continues, Ms Ashraph says she's reminded of Russian tactics in previous conflicts. ""I would say that Russia's actions in Ukraine contain some quite dark echoes of actions in Syria,"" she said. We contacted the Russian defence ministry about all of the cases documented in this article. We have not yet received a response. "
751,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-61023869,2022-04-09T23:03:15,How will Russia attack in east Ukraine?," The conflict in Ukraine has shifted to the east of the country where Ukrainian forces are battle-hardened and well-prepared. Analysts believe Ukraine's best units are in the east, and that they are dug into trench systems and other fortified positions. So far, Ukrainian troops have strongly resisted the Russian advance, but they could be heavily outnumbered by Russian forces who are inching forwards in some areas. Russian officials have said that the focus of its forces is now the ""complete liberation"" of the Donbas, broadly referring to Ukraine's eastern regions of Luhansk and Donetsk. The open terrain in the east will pose challenges for the Russians as they attack. With less wooded land in their way than in the north of the country, Russian troops may be able to advance with fewer obstructions. But analysts say moving across open areas may expose Russian attackers to greater Ukrainian firepower. The battle for Slovyansk is likely to be the next pivotal battle of the war, according to the Institute for the Study of War (ISW). If Russian troops advancing from Izyum are able to take the town, they could then choose to advance east towards Severodonetsk to encircle a relatively small group of Ukrainian forces, or head further south to encircle a larger Ukrainian contingent. If Mariupol falls to the Russians, more troops may also be available to push north into the area west of Donetsk. Brigadier Ben Barry (retired), of the International Institute for Strategic Studies, says Ukrainian forces have had years to prepare their defences and that Russian troops may struggle to force them out. ""It's not just World War One-style trenches on the Ukrainian side, they will have also fortified key towns and villages they want to defend,"" he says. Ukrainian armoured vehicles and other equipment are positioned in revetments, or earth banks, for protection, he says. Many Ukrainian troops in the east are highly experienced - they have been holding back Russian separatists since the conflict of 2014. Their numbers may also be boosted, should Ukraine's military chiefs re-deploy units no longer needed to defend Kyiv after Russia's withdrawal from the north. Brigadier Barry says Russia is likely to make heavy use of artillery, to break down strong Ukrainian defences from the air before pushing forward on the ground. Artillery is heavy weaponry designed to fire munitions much further than small arms, Attacking Ukrainian troops head on with infantry, without a heavy artillery bombardment first, risks huge Russian casualties and greatly increases the risk of defeat. Russia has a range of weaponry to draw on. In particular, self-propelled artillery, in which Russia dominates, will be ""a very significant factor"", says Brigadier Barry. Self-propelled artillery has the appearance of a tank, but fires munitions upwards to then fall on to a target, rather than shooting directly at it. It is more heavily protected than a towed gun, and can advance quickly when enemy defences break down. Those opportunities to move forward may be rare, however, as front lines become semi-fixed in many areas. ""It could take on quite a bloody and attritional feel,"" says Brigadier Barry. To pound Ukrainian positions from a greater distance, Russia has grad multiple rocket launcher systems and is likely to use them heavily. Grads have 40 rockets which can be fired in as little as 20 seconds, and have already inflicted a catastrophic toll on civilian populations in some areas, reducing residential districts of Kharkiv, Mariupol and other cities to rubble. Reports suggest thermobaric weapons have also been used by Russian forces in parts of Ukraine, including Mariupol in Donetsk and Izyum in Kharkiv. They are much more devastating than conventional explosives of similar size, scattering a fuel mixture as a cloud, which then detonates, producing a huge fireball and massive blast wave. Samuel Cranny-Evans, of the Royal United Services Institute, says they are ""primarily designed for urban warfare"" because the cloud of fuel mixture which is scattered after the initial impact can penetrate gaps in buildings before detonating. If Russian artillery is successful in destroying key Ukrainian defences, Russia is likely to use infantry with small arms and a range of wheeled and tracked vehicles, together with tanks with heavy fire power, to lead advances across terrain swept by Ukrainian fire. Air power in support could include fighter bombers and attack helicopters. Ukraine's foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, says the fighting ""will remind you of the Second World War"". Analysts say it is unclear whether Russian forces have addressed the serious logistical problems they encountered in the first weeks of this campaign. Troops struggled with insufficient fuel, food, water and basic equipment, such as radios and cold weather clothing. ""The key will also be training, motivation and leadership. The Russians did not perform well around Kyiv and we just don't know whether they have learned the lessons,"" says Brigadier Barry. Reports also suggest that Russia has lost more than three times as much military hardware as Ukraine in the war so far. How this might affect the war in the east is unclear, but replacing lost equipment could present serious challenges. Oryx, an open source military analysis website, tracks military equipment losses and only includes destroyed vehicles and equipment of which photographic or video evidence is available. It estimates that Russia has lost more than 400 tanks, 20 aircraft and 32 helicopters, as well as hundreds of armoured vehicles and other equipment. Smaller Ukrainian losses may reflect the size of Ukraine's armed forces, but may also signal tactical success. Ukraine has captured significant amounts of Russian equipment, but it is unclear how useful it will be. Michael Kofman, of the US-based Center for Naval Analyses (CNA), says: ""It's going to be a while before this kit is serviceable, manned, and deployed where it makes a tangible difference. A few captured tanks or IFVs [Infantry Fighting Vehicles] do not an armoured brigade make."" In the long run, Russia may also have a crucial advantage, particularly if Western supplies to Ukraine continue to be restricted to defensive equipment. Mr Cranny-Evans says: ""For every Ukrainian grad rocket launcher or howitzer destroyed, in most cases, there are no replacements, they're gone. But Russia still has manufacturing capability - so for Russian troops, these things are not irreplaceable. So, as the war goes on, time begins to shift in Russia's favour."" "
752,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-61055105,2022-04-09T21:28:48,Ukraine war: Disbelief and horror after Kramatorsk train station attack," More than 50 people were killed and many more wounded in a missile strike on a train station in the eastern city of Kramatorsk on Friday. One day later, people are attempting to pick up the pieces from the deadly attack. They're still searching through the wreckage and debris at Kramatorsk station. The bodies of the dead were soon removed from the scene of a missile strike on Friday, but you can still see the dried blood and some evidence of human remains 24 hours later. The uncollected travel bags of those who did not survive have been gathered together and now lie in an empty ticket office. Sergei, a volunteer with the Ukrainian Army, was still looking through the wreckage of destroyed cars, parked outside the station. There was evidence in one of a burnt child's body. Sergei is used to death. He's been recovering the bodies of Ukrainian soldiers killed in battle. But on Friday, he was having to gather the corpses and the remains of unarmed civilians - the innocents of this war. He has no doubt that Russia is to blame for the attack that has left more than 50 people dead and many more injured. Watching mothers grieve over children killed in the blast has clearly taken its toll on Sergei. ""When you see our future, the future of Ukraine being killed, you can't control your emotions,"" he says. He calls it a genocide. ""You just don't understand the motivation of the people who did this. What was this for?"" Thousands of people were gathered at Kramatorsk station when the missile struck at 10:30 in the morning. They were waiting for a train to take them west, to relative safety. The region's authorities had told civilians to leave as Russia steps up its offensive in the Donbas. Kramatorsk and a number of other cities in eastern Ukraine have recently been targeted by Russian airstrikes, artillery and missiles. Russia has denied it was responsible for Friday's attack. It even claims that it wasn't their missile. It's still not clear what exactly happened. Ukraine's state railway says the station was hit by two missiles. The damage is certainly spread over a wide area. It's possible there were three missiles - and one was shot down by Ukraine's air defences. On Saturday, investigators were examining the remains of what looks like a Tochka missile which landed just yards from the station. Part of the casing remains intact. In white paint, someone has written in Russian: ""For the Children"". Was it meant as some kind of revenge? If so, for what? Eyewitnesses also describe seeing multiple explosions, raising questions as to whether the missile, or missiles, had been fitted with cluster munitions. Banned by many countries, they're designed to kill and maim over a wide area. At Kramatorsk hospital, medical staff had been working through the day and night to treat the many injured. Surgeon Victor Borisovich said six people died before they had a chance to operate. Another two died after surgery - including a young child. Victor says many were life-threatening injuries, which he lists as ""amputations, torn limbs, torn feet, stomach wounds and brain injuries"". He tells me he has no doubt that the injuries and deaths were the responsibility of Russia. ""I can't imagine what kind of person takes the decision to launch a missile into a place where civilians are gathering,"" he says. ""It just cannot be explained."" When we arrived at the hospital, a small number of patients were being loaded into ambulances to be taken to Dnipro, further west, for surgery. They still had pieces of shrapnel embedded in their bodies. Some were clearly still in shock. One woman said it was a miracle she'd survived. She described the scene. ""There were a lot of explosions. I fell down, then I started running, but people started to shout, 'Get down,' so I fell on the ground again."" When she got up again, she says, she realised many were dead. ""God saved me,"" she says. Few of those we spoke to were willing to say who was responsible for their injuries. One woman did blame Russia, but she also suggested that the target might have been a train carrying military equipment. We saw no evidence of that when we arrived a few hours after the blast. It is still possible that the people waiting for a train were not the intended target. Western officials say that a Tochka missile, also known as an SS-21 Scarab, can miss its target by up to 30m. Even that suggests that whoever fired the missile knew that lots of people could be in harm's way. But if the missile was designed to kill unarmed civilians waiting for a train, then Western politicians are in no doubt that it would amount to a war crime. "

No 10 said the visit was a ""show of solidarity"" with the Ukrainian people. Following the meeting, Downing Street said the UK would send 120 armoured vehicles and anti-ship missile systems to support Ukraine. Senior officials in Mr Zelensky's team praised the UK for support during its conflict with Russia. Mr Johnson's visit to Kyiv was not announced in advance and the first indication he was in the city came when a photograph of his meeting with President Zelensky was put on Twitter by the Ukrainian embassy in London. A Downing Street spokesman said: ""The prime minister has travelled to Ukraine to meet President Zelensky in person, in a show of solidarity with the Ukrainian people."" In a statement after the meeting, Mr Johnson paid tribute to ""President Zelensky's resolute leadership and the invincible heroism and courage of the Ukrainian people"", saying: ""Ukraine has defied the odds and pushed back Russian forces from the gates of Kyiv"". He said: ""I made clear today that the United Kingdom stands unwaveringly with them in this ongoing fight, and we are in it for the long run. ""We are stepping up our own military and economic support and convening a global alliance to bring this tragedy to an end, and ensure Ukraine survives and thrives as a free and sovereign nation."" Mr Johnson also confirmed further economic support, taking total UK loan guarantees to £770m. Speaking in a video address alongside President Zelensky a short while later, Mr Johnson said Ukrainians ""have shown the courage of a lion but you, Volodymyr, have given the roar of that lion"". He reiterated that the UK and other countries supporting Ukraine would continue to tighten economic sanctions on Moscow, including moving away from the use of Russian hydrocarbons. The PM added: ""Over the last few hours I've been able to see quite a lot of your beautiful country and it's an amazing country. I've also seen the tragic effects of the war, an inexcusable war, an absolutely inexcusable and unnecessary war."" Mr Zelensky welcomed the UK's ""decisive and significant support"" for his country and urged other Western allies to intensify the pressure on Moscow. ""We have to exert pressure in the form of sanctions. It is time to impose a complete embargo on Russian energy resources. They should increase the amount of weapons being supplied,"" he said. In a Facebook post, Andriy Sybiha, deputy head of the Ukrainian president's office, said: ""The UK is the leader in defence support for Ukraine. The leader in the anti-war coalition. The leader in sanctions against the Russian aggressor."" European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and the EU's foreign policy chief Josep Borrell both made visits to Ukraine for talks with President Zelensky on Friday, and Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer met him in Kyiv on Saturday. But Mr Johnson is the first member of a G7 country to travel to the Ukrainian capital for talks during the conflict. Mr Zelensky has called on the international community to hold to account Russian forces who carried out the missile strike on Kramatorsk station, which was packed with women and children trying to flee the area. The Kremlin has denied responsibility for the attack. Mr Johnson's visit to Kyiv came the day after the UK announced £100m of weapons for the country. Speaking at a Downing Street press conference on Friday, Mr Johnson said the UK will send additional military equipment including Starstreak anti-aircraft missiles and 800 anti-tank missiles. It followed an appeal from Ukraine for more arms as it prepares for an expected Russian offensive in the east of the country, after Moscow pulled back its forces from around Kyiv. "

The National Farmers Union (NFU) Scotland said rising fuel costs and grain shortages could mean prices going up and goods becoming scarce. The Scottish government is calling for a summit of ministers from across the UK to discuss the problems now facing farmers, fishermen and food producers. The UK environment secretary said he would consider the request. NFU Scotland president Martin Kennedy told BBC Scotland the impact of Russia's invasion, after a two-year period hit by the consequences of Brexit and the Covid pandemic, was ""absolutely devastating"". He added: ""I have not seen anything like this before. It is completely unprecedented. ""The long-term implications of that is going to have a serious impact right across the food supply chain."" ""We have heard the term before, about a 'perfect storm', but I have never seen anything like this before."" Mr Kennedy said pig farming is under threat due to the rising cost of feed and warned imminent intervention was needed to ensure pork remains on shop shelves. There have also reports, in recent weeks, of soaring costs making it unviable for some fishing vessels to leave port, as well as the food processing and storage sectors being hit hard by rising overhead costs. The removal of tax relief for red diesel has also also led to price increases. To illustrate the challenges facing the sector, Mr Kennedy said he paid £240 for a tonne of fertiliser last year, but this year the price has soared to about £800. Scotland's Rural Affairs Secretary has called for an urgent four-nations summit to consider how to respond to ""hardship"" in the food sector linked to the Ukraine crisis. Mairi Gougeon said Russia's invasion has had a ""significant impact"" on the UK's food supply chain. She has written to her UK counterpart, the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Secretary George Eustice, to highlight her concerns. Ms Gougeon said ministers in the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) had previously pledged to have ""regular discussions"" with the devolved governments on the issue. But she claimed there had been ""no opportunity for discussions with UK Government"". Ms Gougeon told Mr Eustice: ""I am concerned that this lack of engagement will only lead again to suffering by Scottish businesses who were left fighting for support to continue to deliver exports following the Brexit deal."" Defra confirmed that the environment secretary had received the letter and said he would ""respond in due course"". Meanwhile, a rally has been held in Glasgow's George Square to highlight the plight of the Ukrainian people. Organiser Kasia Tym told BBC Scotland the aim was to keep the crisis in the public eye. Ms Tym said: ""I think there is an aspect of trending news. There is a shock factor that applies for ten days max and then it kind of dies down. ""For us it is very important to keep the conversation going because the war is still happening. ""It is still as violent as [when] it started and the people need even more help now because resources are running out."" "

More than 240 people will spend the next few days at a warehouse in Dorchester in Dorset, filling backpacks with books, toys, hats, scarves, food, toothbrushes and other essentials. The rucksacks will also contain letters from children in the UK. Five lorries will transport the bags to countries bordering Ukraine with all items due to be delivered by Easter. The Packed with Hope initiative is being led by publishers Gracie Cooper, of Little Toller Books in Beaminster, in Dorset, and Kevin Duffy, of Bluemoose Books in Hebden Bridge, West Yorkshire. Ms Cooper said almost 250 volunteers from across the UK had come forward to help pack the bags. ""It is incredible, it shows to me the very best of humanity. I am totally overwhelmed,"" she said. Ms Cooper said she came up with the initiative when her son came home from school and quizzed her about what was happening in Ukraine. The backpacks will also contain books for children whose first language is not English. ""If it makes one child smile, feel a little bit better, then I feel I have achieved something,"" Ms Cooper said. The first lorry delivering food is expected to leave the UK on Monday with the others due to leave by 15 April. Follow BBC South on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram.

760,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-61038811,2022-04-09T05:02:21,"Ukraine mother: I saw my daughter killed, then was held captive in basement"," Viktoria Kovalenko remembers the moment clearly. ""There was an explosion, or some kind of shots. It deafened me. The back windscreen shattered. My husband shouted, 'Get out of the car.'"" The horror of that day is almost unimaginable. The following account contains graphic detail which some may find distressing Nine days into the war in Ukraine, as the fighting raged, Viktoria and her husband Petro had finally decided to flee Chernihiv, in the north of the country. They wanted to keep the children safe. Twelve-year-old Veronika was Viktoria's daughter from her first marriage. Her other daughter, Varvara, is just a year old. They took what they needed, and drove away from their family home. As they left the outskirts of the city, heading south near the village of Yahidne, stones in the road blocked their path. Petro pulled over, climbed out and started to haul them out of the way. Seconds later, their car was fired on. ""My older daughter Veronika started to cry, because my head had been cut by a piece of flying glass and I was bleeding,"" says Viktoria. As she speaks, she points to a spot high on her left cheekbone, a small, twisted red scar. ""Veronika started to shout, her hands were shaking, so I tried to calm her. She got out of the car and I went to follow. As I got out I saw her fall. When I looked, her head was gone. The car had been struck by a Russian shell and burst into flames. ""I tried to stay calm, I was holding my baby daughter and I needed to get her to safety"". She didn't see Petro again, but his silence told Viktoria that her husband too was dead. She ran from the burning car. The next 24 hours were a desperate attempt to stay alive. Viktoria and her baby, Varvara, found shelter in a parked car, but then the shooting began again. She ran to a small building that had clearly been used by soldiers. Hiding there, her phone switched off to save battery, she wondered how she'd keep herself and her daughter safe. The next day, they were discovered by patrolling Russian troops. They were taken to a school in Yahidne and held captive in the basement. Mother and baby spent the next 24 days there, in appalling conditions. Viktoria watched people die around her, unable to access the medical care they needed. The BBC has since visited the basement, and spoken to other people held there. Captives describe the bodies lying uncollected for hours, sometimes days. There were 40 people in the room, Viktoria says, with little space to move or walk. There was no light, so they used candles and cigarette lighters. It was dusty and hot, and Viktoria says people found it difficult to breathe. Most of the time people were not allowed to go out even to use a toilet. They were made to use buckets instead. ""The lack of movement made people ill, they sat on the chairs, they slept on the chairs. We could see their veins, and they started to bleed, so we made bandages,"" recalls Viktoria. It was in these conditions that Viktoria had to mentally process the brutal loss of her husband and eldest daughter. She told me she stayed as calm and determined as she could, focusing all her energy on saving the life of her remaining child. But she asked her Russian captors to bring the bodies of Petro and Veronika to the school, so she could bury them. She sent her ex-husband, Veronika's father, to the wreckage of the car so he could take pictures of the remains. They are barely recognisable as human. Almost nothing was left from the burned-out vehicle: some of Veronika's clothes, pock-marked with holes and smeared with soot; a small bracelet with a heart-shaped charm; two car number plates, bleached silver from the fierce heat of the blaze. Viktoria remembers the day the bodies arrived. ""It was the 12th of March. They called me and said, 'Let's go, and you will see where they will lay down.' They were buried in the forest, in two graves, one box was bigger, one box was smaller. And two crosses with signs. ""We stayed and started to cover the boxes with earth, but shelling started, so we ran away before we had finished burying them. It was very frightening."" I ask Viktoria what she would say to the people who did this to her family. ""If I was given the possibility of shooting Putin, I would do it,"" she replies. ""My hand would not shake."" Now Viktoria and Varvara are in the relative safety of Lviv, in the west of Ukraine. The day before we meet, she'd had her first session with a psychologist. ""When I'm with people, when I do something and communicate, I forget what's happened. But when I'm alone, I'm lost."" As she says the words, the tears fall. She shows me a keyring - a small cuddly cow with a heart on its chest. It was a gift from Veronika. Attached to it is a small gold ring, etched with letters. ""That was from the church, she bought it for me too. It's an amulet, I feel like it saved me. It was in my pocket. The whole time, she was there keeping me safe."" "
761,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-61036740,2022-04-09T04:00:26,Kramatorsk station attack: What we know so far," Scores of people, including children, have been killed when rockets hit a railway station in the eastern Ukrainian city of Kramatorsk. Ukrainian officials say thousands of people were waiting for evacuation trains on Friday morning, desperate to flee heavy Russian shelling across the wider Donetsk region. Both Ukraine and Russia have since blamed each other for the deadly attack. The US, EU and UK have condemned the incident and have since announced additional military support for Ukraine. The railway station was hit at about 10:30 local time (07:30 GMT) on Friday, Kramatorsk Mayor Oleksandr Honcharenk told the BBC. He added this happened as the crowds were ""waiting for the first train"" to be evacuated to safer regions in central and western Ukraine ahead of an expected massive Russian offensive in the east. Oleksandr Kamyshyn, who heads Ukraine's Ukrzaliznytsia state railway company, said two rockets struck the area. Meanwhile, Nathan Mook, an aid worker who saw people crowding at the station, counted between five and 10 explosions: ""Two minutes after we had driven by, you feel it before you hear it: the boom, the explosion."" ""One of our guys at the warehouse said he had seen Ukrainian air defence intercept one of the rockets,"" he said. ""These were missiles, he could see the wings on the missile as it was intercepted."" Mr Mook's aid group World Central Kitchen was distributing food at the station at the time. The EU's foreign policy chief Josep Borrell told the BBC that the attack in Kramatorsk was another attempt to break morale, after Russian forces were unable to win by fighting the Ukrainian army. Ukraine's prosecutor general's office later said that nearly 4,000 people - mainly women and children - were at the station at the time. Debris from one of the rockets could be seen lying on the grass near the station. The message in Russian ""Za detei"", meaning for or on behalf of the children, had been daubed on the missile in white. The BBC's Joe Inwood arrived at the blast scene a few hours later, reporting that the once busy station was almost entirely deserted - save for a few police officers and the workmen boarding up the broken windows. The dozens of bodies that were clearly visible in the gruesome videos of the aftermath were now gone, he says, and the clear-up operation was already well under way. Only a few patches of blood remained. Donetsk regional head Pavlo Kyrylenko wrote on his Telegram page that the death toll had risen to 50. He said that five children were among the dead. About 100 people were injured, a number of them seriously, local officials said. There are fears that the death toll will climb even further. Just minutes after the attack, Mr Kyrylenko accused Russia of using its Iskander short-range ballistic missile with a cluster munitions warhead. But he later corrected himself, saying that Tochka-U rockets had been used. Russia's defence ministry also said that Tochka-U rockets were used in the Kramatorsk strike, blaming Ukraine's armed forces for the attack. Tochka-U rockets are extremely inaccurate, regularly missing their targets by half a kilometre or more, according to Amnesty International weapons experts. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky condemned the attack. Writing on Instagram shortly after the attack, he said: ""Lacking the strength and courage to stand up to us on the battlefield, they are cynically destroying the civilian population. ""This is an evil that has no limits. And if it is not punished, it will never stop."" He added that there were no soldiers at the station. Ukraine has repeatedly accused Russian troops of deliberately targeting civilians since the Russian invasion began on 24 February. It says Russia is responsible for mass killings in the town of Bucha, near Kyiv, and also the bombing of a theatre in the besieged southern port of Mariupol, where many civilians were sheltering from Russian shelling. But Russia denies the accusations. On Friday, the defence ministry in Moscow accused Ukraine's armed forces of carrying out the Kramatorsk attack and using civilians as a ""human shield"", while a Russian-backed separatist leader said it was a Ukrainian ""provocation"". The ministry insisted it did not use the type of Tochka-U missile that was fired, whereas the Ukrainian military did. However, analysts point to images and videos on social media that appear to show the Russian military using the Tochka-U. Mr Zelensky said the missile strike on Kramatorsk ""must be one of the charges at the tribunal"" at the International Criminal Court. ""Like the massacre in Bucha, like many other Russian war crimes"", he added. It is clearly hampering rescue efforts from Kramatorsk - the largest easternmost city in the Donetsk region - which still has rail links to central and western Ukraine. Tens of thousands of people have already used the city's train station to flee ahead of what Ukraine warns is an imminent large-scale offensive by Russian forces in the Donetsk and the adjacent Luhansk regions. But Mr Kyrylenko stressed on Friday that the regional authorities were striving to continue getting civilians out. Meanwhile, the Kramatorsk mayor announced an ""emergency evacuation"" using public and private vehicles. On Friday, he said: ""We are looking for drivers. We'll be needing about 30-40 drivers for today."" "
762,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-61048256,2022-04-09T03:48:55,Inside Chernobyl: We stole Russian fuel to prevent catastrophe," The former nuclear power plant at Chernobyl in northern Ukraine was taken over by Russian forces on the first day of the invasion. It's now back under Ukraine's control. The BBC's Yogita Limaye is among the first journalists to look inside it since the Russians left. On the afternoon of 24 February, Russian forces surrounded Chernobyl with tanks and armoured vehicles, entering Ukraine from the Belarusian border, just about 16km (10 miles) away. About 170 Ukrainian national guards who secured the plant were taken to the basement and held captive there. Then Russian soldiers searched the premises for weapons and explosives. Engineers, supervisors and other technical staff were allowed to continue working. In the next two days, teams from Russia's atomic energy agency Rosatom were brought in. Chernobyl's staff were keen to keep control of the plant's maintenance. It's not a working power station, but radioactive waste is stored at the site of the world's worst nuclear disaster. Billions of dollars have been spent since the accident in 1986 to clean up and contain further contamination. If conditions at the site are not monitored properly, there is a major risk of the release of nuclear material. ""They wanted to know how the facility was managed. They wanted information about all the procedures, documents and operations. I was scared because the questioning was constant, and sometimes forceful,"" said Oleksandr Lobada, a radiation safety supervisor at the station. On the top floor of the main building of the power station are key rooms from where the site is controlled, located on both sides of a long, narrow passage. Some of the rooms were locked. When the Russians didn't find the keys, they broke into the rooms, cutting out the portion of the door in which the lock was embedded. ""We had to constantly negotiate with them, and try hard not to offend them, so that they allowed our personnel to manage the facility,"" said engineer Valeriy Semonov. When the power to the station was cut off for three days, Valeriy said he scrambled to find fuel to keep the generator running, even resorting to stealing some from the Russians. ""If we had lost power, it could have been catastrophic,"" Oleksandr explained. ""Radioactive material could have been released. The scale of it, you can well imagine. I wasn't scared for my life. I was scared about what would happen if I wasn't there monitoring the plant. I was scared it would be a tragedy for humanity."" The area behind the plant called the ""Red Forest"" is one of the most radioactive places on earth. Drone footage released by the Ukrainian military shows that Russian soldiers dug trenches and even stayed there. This was also confirmed to the BBC by officials at the station. It's evidence of how little the soldiers knew about nuclear safety. Energoatom, Ukraine's state-run nuclear power agency, has said Russian soldiers were exposed to ""significant doses"" of radiation. Just outside the sarcophagus which protects the damaged nuclear reactor, Russian soldiers piled up sandbags behind which they could hide if attacked. Valeriy scoffed at this, saying the Ukrainian military wouldn't dream of firing at a nuclear reactor. Down in the basement of the main building, are dormitory style rooms which have been completely ransacked. The floor is littered with rugs, mattresses, clothes, shoes and other personal belongings of the Ukrainian national guard who were held there. Officials at Chernobyl say Russian soldiers looted what they could when they left, and they also took the captive members of the national guard with them. ""We were able to keep the site safe. But it's upsetting that they took 169 of our military,"" said Valeriy. It's not confirmed where the men are being held, but Chernobyl's staff believe they are in Russia. Petro Poroshenko, Ukraine's former president, visited Chernobyl on Friday with food and other supplies for the plant's personnel. Access to it has only just opened up through an off-road track. The bridge to Chernobyl was blown up to stop Russia's advance. President Poroshenko has a warning for the world. ""Are we sure that tomorrow Russian troops cannot appear here? My answer would be no. Putin is completely unpredictable. And nuclear smoke is not limited by borders. It can reach Eastern Europe, Central Europe, and even Great Britain. The danger of nuclear contamination of Europe is very high, while Russia continues this war."" Additional reporting by Imogen Anderson. "
763,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-61021862,2022-04-09T01:47:24,"Ukraine, the UN and history's greatest broken promise"," Accounts of atrocities committed by Russian troops against Ukrainian civilians are emerging daily. There are calls for President Putin and others to be prosecuted for war crimes - but how likely is that to happen? Given its past record, and failure to stop this war which has seen more than 11 million people flee their homes, the BBC's Fergal Keane considers whether the international community will be able to unite. Even when the spring sunlight fills the little park, it remains an unsettling place. The Jewish world commemorated at Arsenalna Square in central Lviv was destroyed by genocide. The people who worshipped at the Golden Rose synagogue were either exiled or killed. There is no escape from history here. It is present in the memorial stones for the dead and in the void left by a murdered generation. In western Ukraine's biggest city, the past collides with the present in other ways too. You can hear it in the rattle of today's refugee suitcases being pulled across the same cobblestoned streets where, in the high summer of 1941, the Germans and their Ukrainian collaborators chased Jews to their deaths. The photos of those days are some of the most terrible of the Holocaust - women being stripped and beaten before jeering mobs, eyes wide in horror, mouths frozen in mid-scream. We are not in the middle of a new world war, or a Holocaust, but the lessons for the world of that terrible conflict - and the promises made in its aftermath - have a relevance we cannot ignore today. It was a reality framed in scathing terms by the Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky when he addressed the Security Council of the United Nations this week. He reminded his audience that the UN had been established in 1945 to guarantee peace after the horrors of World War Two. Listing allegations of war crimes by Russian troops in Ukraine - summary killings, torture, rape - he called for the council to order a war crimes investigation. ""Are you ready to close the UN?"" he asked. ""Do you think that the time of international law is gone? If your answer is no, then you need to act immediately."" The threat to the peace of Europe is greater now than at any time since the end of the Cold War in 1989. For nearly a month, I watched families flee westward from Lviv in trains, cars and buses as Russia waged war on their homeland. I listened to survivors from the besieged port of Mariupol talk of a hell on earth with bodies lying in the streets and the cityscape they knew, of shops, restaurants, the Hurov Park with its spectacular fountains, reduced to rubble. Less than a year ago, I walked through the Hurov with Lyubov Vasilievna and Dominic, her two-year-old grandson. I have known Lyubov for eight years, since the day she was wounded and two other grandchildren - Nikita, 10, and Karolina, six - were killed at the war's beginning in 2014 after Russian-backed forces staged a rebellion in eastern Ukraine against the Kyiv government. The three of them had been out walking when a shell exploded. In hospital, Lyubov told me she blamed herself for their deaths. ""I don't know how I am going to survive this. The images of them are always in front of my eyes,"" she said. So, it was heartening to meet her again last year, in a time of relative peace, with a new grandchild. ""I am smiling because I live for him now,"" she told me. ""I have someone to take care of. He brings me joy."" Now, as Mariupol is being destroyed, I do not know what has happened to Lyubov and Dominic. I have called and called, but her phone no longer rings. Every day at Lviv railway station I watched for their faces in the crowds of refugees, but there was no sign. Lyubov and Dominic, and the dead Nikita and Karolina, are among many millions failed by history's greatest broken promise. It was made in the aftermath of World War Two and is firmly rooted in the story of Lviv. In the far western corner of Ukraine, Lviv is a city to remind us of the worst of mankind, but also of what can be done to protect us from the consequences of aggression. Walk five minutes west from the ruins of the synagogue and you reach a squat two-storey building that was the cradle of the world's most important human rights legislation - the very principles under which President Putin and his armies might yet face judgement. The law faculty of the University of Lviv was the alma mater of Raphael Lemkin who invented the word genocide to describe the attempt to exterminate ""in whole or in part"" a national, religious or racial group. Aghast at the Nazi Holocaust Lemkin coined the term in 1944 and, four years later, succeeded in having the UN define genocide as a crime under international law. His fellow alumnus, Hersch Lauterpacht, was instrumental in bringing about the legal concept of crimes against humanity which was first used to prosecute Nazi leaders at the Nuremberg trials in 1945-46. Both men were Jewish and studied in Lviv in the early decades of the 20th Century. Lviv was called Lemberg then and was a city of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, home to a cosmopolitan mix of Poles, Ukrainians, Russians and other nationalities from across the empire. World War One destroyed Austria-Hungary and ushered in an age of instability as Poles, Ukrainians, the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany fought for control of the city. The majority of the remaining Jewish population was wiped out in the Holocaust, among them the relatives of Lemkin and Lauterpacht. At the end of World War Two, Lviv came under the rule of the Soviet Union, where it remained until the fall of communism and the creation of an independent Ukraine in 1991. Although they differed in important respects - Lemkin argued in favour of group protections, Lauterpacht focused on individual rights - their legacies were enshrined in the 1945 UN Charter, which promised to ""save succeeding generations from the scourge of war which, twice in our lifetimes, has brought untold sorrow to mankind, and to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth of the human person…"" Now, Lviv finds itself once more at the centre of a great historical trauma. I think of that phrase - ""the dignity and worth of the human person"" - after watching people fight to board trains in the early days of the evacuation of Ukraine. I remember it when I see the images of executed civilians in Bucha, and I wonder what has happened to the dream of the lawyers from Lviv? We are living in an age where millions are displaced by war. I have seen them jumping from smugglers' boats into the shallows on a Greek beach, shouting with joy that ""God is Great"". In the Democratic Republic of Congo, Myanmar and Yemen, I have heard civilian victims describe cruel military campaigns. According to the most recent UN statistics - gathered before the Russian invasion of Ukraine - 84 million people are now forcibly displaced worldwide. The figures reflect an international order in crisis with the UN unable to prevent the murder and abuse of civilians in many regions of the world. To understand how we have come to this point it is necessary to go back a little to one of the most terrible crimes of our modern era. It all happened in Rwanda - genocide, crimes against humanity and mass rape as a weapon of war. In late spring of 1994, I was sent to the small, central African country that had become a vast open-air cemetery. The dead flowed down rivers. They lay piled up in churches. The smell of decomposing bodies hung over abandoned villages. In the space of 100 days, up to 800,000 people are estimated to have been murdered in the Rwandan genocide. It also sparked one of the worst refugee crises in living memory. Rwanda happened because a hate-filled elite decided that the solution to the country's problems was to exterminate the Tutsi ethnic minority. Two weeks into the genocide, with tens of thousands already slaughtered, the UN Security Council voted to reduce the peacekeeping force from over 2,000 members to 270. This came after 10 Belgian peacekeepers were attacked and killed by the Rwandan army. The great powers abandoned Rwanda to its fate. Unlike Ukraine now, Rwanda was a country with little geo-political importance. The US and other powers on the Security Council refused until it was too late to use the word coined by the Lviv lawyer, Raphael Lemkin, because describing the slaughter as ""genocide"" might have created a responsibility to intervene and protect the victims under Article 1 of the Genocide Convention. I cannot ever forget the sight of Tutsi refugees huddled a few yards from me outside a municipal office in Butare - a city in southern Rwanda - surrounded by extremist militia and soldiers, and wondering if they would live or die. Many were ultimately slaughtered. In July 1995, one year after the Rwandan genocide ended, Bosnian Serb forces under General Ratko Mladic murdered 8,000 Muslim men and boys when they overran the town of Srebrenica. It happened under the eyes of Dutch UN peacekeepers. The two genocides of the 1990s - in central Africa and the former Yugoslavia - showed what happened when the Security Council was challenged to live up to words of the UN charter. The promise of 1945 was frustrated by lack of political will and division. But those terrible years of the 1990s would come to have a profound effect on international law. If there was a failure to prevent genocide it could at least be punished. Tribunals were set up to try the accused of Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia. There were also courts to try those accused of responsibility for mass killings in Cambodia and Sierra Leone. There were UN military operations to stop the killing of civilians in Sierra Leone and Nato forces intervened to end the expulsion of ethnic Albanians in Kosovo. Although, the latter provoked an ominous confrontation with Russia, an ally of Serbia and already wary of Nato encroachment to the east. The world moved to establish a permanent court to try cases of genocide and crimes against humanity. The International Criminal Court - the ICC - was set up in 1998 to try the most serious cases of human rights abuses. It is not part of the UN but was created by UN members and works closely with the organisation. In 2009, in a landmark moment, President Omar al-Bashir of Sudan, became the first sitting head of state to be indicted for genocide by the ICC, for the killing of civilians in Darfur. Just as at the end of WW2, the idea was that prosecutions might not only provide accountability but would make future war leaders think twice before abusing the rights of civilians. But there was a problem from day one, and it is one that shadows the current debate about war crimes in Ukraine. Neither the US, China or Russia ratified the Rome Statute - the treaty that established the court. This means the three biggest military powers are not subject to ICC jurisdiction. The only way they could be is if the Security Council votes to refer them. But as each nation has a veto, that is never going to happen. It means the ICC would be powerless if it wanted to indict President Putin and his senior generals for the crime of waging an aggressive war against Ukraine. Aggression was described by the Nuremberg tribunal after WW2 as ""the supreme international crime differing only from other war crimes in that it contains within itself the accumulated evil of the whole"". It is worth remembering what happened when the court tried to investigate alleged war crimes by all the parties in Afghanistan. The Trump administration went as far as placing sanctions on the chief prosecutor of the ICC to signal its opposition to any judicial pursuit of US forces. And - in China's autonomous region of Xinjiang - an attempt to investigate Chinese officials for the alleged genocide against the Uyghurs failed because China was not an ICC member. The war crimes lawyer, Prof Philippe Sands QC, believes the attitude of the superpowers creates ""lopsided justice"" where the only prosecutions are those involving less powerful nations. ""One rule for the weak, one rule for the strong - is ultimately not a sustainable legal order or even really a legal order,"" he says. Prof Sands' grandfather came from Lviv, and his great-grandmother was murdered by the Nazis. He is among those looking at the possibility of setting up a special international tribunal to indict the Russian president and his commanders. But the legal framework is not the only issue that hangs over the current debate about the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Even some supporters of prosecuting President Putin acknowledge a charge of double standards against the US and the UK. Prof Sands points out that the invasion of Iraq in 2003 by a US-led coalition polarised world opinion. The then UN Secretary General Kofi Annan would later call the invasion illegal. ""You reap what you sow - and what you sow includes your own double standards,"" he says. The British and American governments insisted the invasion was legal. But President Putin used the Iraq example as a rhetorical stick to beat the US and UK when he announced his decision to attack Ukraine, declaring that there was a ""special place"" for the invasion of Iraq - which had been carried out ""without any legal grounds"". In reality, there has never been a golden age of post-war peace guided by international diplomacy. The big powers have not fought an apocalyptic nuclear war but millions have died in wars big and small - in Korea, Algeria, Congo, Cambodia, Vietnam, Algeria, Indonesia, Angola, Ethiopia, Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Libya and many other battlegrounds. Some of those wars have been - at least partly - proxy conflicts between superpowers. More than 4,000 UN peacekeepers have lost their lives in different conflict zones trying to protect civilians and act as a buffer between warring parties. Rather than being a place where the great powers consistently work for peace, the Security Council, too often, became a forum of superpower rivalry. Ukraine is just the latest dangerous example. On 26 February, two days after the Russian invasion began, the Security Council met to discuss a resolution calling on Moscow to stop its attack and withdraw all troops. Russia vetoed that move for peace. In a singularly ominous moment, President Putin implicitly threatened to use nuclear weapons to deter any intervention by Nato. Whether he intends to deploy nukes or not, the simple issuing of such a threat reflects the perilous state of human affairs in the 21st Century. The current UN Secretary General, António Guterres, sounded almost forlorn when he declared: ""We must never give up. We must give peace another chance."" But even some of those critical of the Security Council, argue that this can also be a moment of possibility - if, for example, a special tribunal can be set up to investigate a superpower like Russia for its actions. ""I am partly fearful but also partly optimistic,"" says Prof Sands. ""This period could destroy the [legal] order created by the 1945 moment [the defeat of Nazism] or it might develop and strengthen it. I am inclined to the latter view. It's a long game. Two steps forward and one back, then another forward. We just have to stick to a principled approach."" There have also been important signs of change at the UN in recent days. The General Assembly - the body made up of all 193 UN members - condemned the invasion and voted to remove Russia from the UN Human Rights Council. China voted against the move and India abstained - between them they represent a third of the world's population. And while the decision doesn't affect what the Security Council does or does not do, the moral signal from more than two thirds of UN members was clear. One former UN official with experience of genocide and war crimes told me that it was a mistake to see the present world order solely through the lens of big power politics. Prof Mukesh Kapila of the University of Manchester is a former UN representative in Sudan and was instrumental in the campaign to have the killings in Darfur recognised as genocide. ""In the struggle between right and wrong, good and evil, there is a lot of activity. It is not all going on the side of the bad guys,"" he says. He points to the case against Myanmar at the International Court of Justice - a UN court established in 1945 where one state can bring action against another. Myanmar is being pursued by the small west African nation of The Gambia for alleged persecution of the Rohingya Muslims. Prof Kapila also cites the development in recent years of ""universal jurisdiction"" - where individual nations can try alleged war criminals from other countries if they arrest them on their soil. The successful German prosecution last January of a Syrian officer for murder, torture and sexual assault is recent example. Calls for reform of the UN Security Council are not new. It has long been criticised for representing the imperial and superpower realities that prevailed at the end of WW2. There is no permanent representation for Africa, the Indian sub-continent or Latin America. Expanding the UN's top body would not at a stroke remove the potential for great power rivalry. But Prof Kapila suggests one way around the stalemates created by veto powers would be to strengthen the role of the General Assembly - the body that has just acted against Russia. ""If the Security Council is deadlocked, then why not create a mechanism where one member can take it to a bigger jury - the General Assembly. It is more democratic, and it also increases pressure on the Security Council to reach an agreement."" There seems little prospect at the moment of the ""Permanent Five"" - China, France, Russia, the UK and US - agreeing to dilute their influence. ""Turkeys don't vote for Christmas,"" as Prof Kapila puts it. But he argues that civil society movements have established powerful pressure for progress in recent years - in the area of climate change, for example. ""Things which seem improbable now can become real."" At the heart of the promise made in the UN Charter was the idea that countries must work together to avoid war. If armed conflict did break out they would send forces to try to keep the peace and the world would ensure abuses were prosecuted - both for the sake of justice and to deter future crimes. It is possible - no more than that - that the crisis in Ukraine becomes one of those moments where the high stakes of conflict create a genuine moment of international reflection and generate a momentum for change. Before she stepped down from power, the German Chancellor Angela Merkel wistfully reflected on a world where unilateral action by states threatened peace and stability. Mrs Merkel, who grew up in East Germany before the fall of the Berlin Wall and in the looming shadow of superpower rivalry, warned of the dangers of forgetting - especially as those with lived experience of WW2 died away. ""We have to take care now not to enter a historical phase in which important lessons from history fade away. We have to remind ourselves that the multilateral world order was created as a lesson from the Second World War."" Remember where we have come from, was the message, and act so that we are not dragged backwards. © 2022 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.

764,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-61044063,2022-04-08T23:51:38,Ukraine: Inside the spies’ attempts to stop the war," Traditionally, it is the job of a spy to keep secrets - but as the invasion of Ukraine loomed, Western intelligence officials made the unusual decision to tell the world what they knew. For nearly a dozen days in February, a small group of intelligence officers had been going to bed early. They had seen the intelligence predicting a war and knew that if Russia was really going to invade Ukraine, it would begin in the early hours of the morning. But when the news finally came on 24 February, it still felt unreal, one recalls: ""It was hard to believe it was actually happening until I woke up early that morning and put the radio on."" For months they had been sounding the alarm. ""That day people went from 'Why are you being so hysterical?' to 'Why weren't you more hysterical?'"" says the official. There was no satisfaction in being proved right, another intelligence official adds. But at least they felt they had tried to stop a war whose scale they had been warning of for months. The run-up to war and the weeks after it started saw American and British intelligence make public some of their most closely held secrets as part of an unprecedented campaign. For decades, intelligence had normally been something to share with as few individuals as possible. No longer. The decision had been taken to make the whole world know about it. This not only marked a dramatic shift in the way Western intelligence had been operating - it also meant confronting the painful legacy of the invasion of Iraq. The first signs of Russia's intentions arrived a year ago. Intelligence from satellite imagery pointed to a Russian troop build-up near Ukraine. But analysts had little understanding of Moscow's true intentions. That changed in mid-2021. ""From summer we saw a small group of senior people planning for a full military invasion of the whole country,"" explains one Western intelligence official. The intelligence-gathering and analysis was a joint US-UK affair, those involved say - one calling it a ""family"" operation. There was no single moment of understanding but rather a picture that became increasingly clear as time passed. The exact provenance of the intelligence remains classified - officials suggest it came from multiple sources. But it provided a picture which continued to build as London and Washington saw invasion plans being finalised. Vladimir Putin seemed to believe he had to act quickly to fulfil his ambition of bringing Ukraine back into Russia's sphere of influence. And he believed the only way to do so was by using force. ""He felt like he had a closing window of opportunity,"" says one person who was directly involved. By autumn, Washington had decided it needed to do something with what it was being told by its spies. That decision, those involved say, was taken at the very highest level of the White House by President Biden. A crucial moment came in early November when CIA Director William Burns travelled to Moscow - to warn that Washington knew what was being planned. The trip was not kept secret. The first time some Russian officials were told that their country might be seriously intending to act against Ukraine was when they heard it from the director of the CIA, one official says. The next stage was to make some of the intelligence public. One individual involved in the discussions, who like others spoke on condition of anonymity, recalls times where it was asked: ""What is the point of knowing all of this, if we can't do something with it?"" In Washington, Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines - who briefed allies at Nato in November - and National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan are credited with pushing for the release of material. Experts on declassification, trained to understand the risks, began to work round the clock to establish what could be shared. ""The Intelligence Community surged personnel and resources to support classification reviews for increased intelligence sharing with allies and partners and declassification reviews for potential release to the public (and) leveraged its established declassification process, which is designed to protect sources and methods,"" Nicole de Haay, a spokeswoman for the US intelligence community, told the BBC. One advantage was being able to use commercially available satellite imagery to support the case. By early December, details of Russia's plans for a 175,000-strong invasion had appeared in the Washington Post. In London, the intelligence - coming in from GCHQ and MI6 - was met with near-disbelief in some quarters. A common problem inside and outside government was that people simply could not believe a major land war could break out in Europe in the 21st Century. It was only late in the year - after the material went through a formal assessment process and the Joint Intelligence Committee issued its considered view that an invasion was now ""highly likely"" - that everyone began to realise this was for real. The rigour of that process was a direct result of lessons learned nearly two decades ago when intelligence had been used to make the public case for war in Iraq in a haphazard, improvised way. In 2003, amid accusations of politicisation, the reputation of US and UK spies was damaged - especially after the intelligence proved to be wrong. The ghosts of Iraq have since haunted discussions about using intelligence in public - but Ukraine offered an opportunity to try to put that legacy to bed. New procedures had been put in place to ensure secret information went through a strict assessment process to govern how it could be used. Other allies were also briefed. But many remained sceptical. Because the source of the intelligence could not be shared it was sometimes hard to overcome this incredulity, one official says. Some European partners did not buy the analysis that Russia's build-up was anything more than bluff. A scepticism about Anglo-American intelligence was also another legacy of Iraq's missing weapons of mass destruction. France has recently sacked its head of military intelligence for failing to appreciate what was being planned. The fear for spies in publicising material is that this tips off the other side that they have a leak and potentially closes off that source. This was why, in World War Two, the UK kept the secret of Bletchley Park so tightly. There have been other occasions since Iraq when intelligence has been made public, for instance over the use of chemical weapons in Syria, but never on the scale seen over Ukraine. The release included the UK sharing details of Russian plans to install specific individuals as part of a puppet government in Kyiv - and Washington revealing plans by Moscow to stage pretexts for war, so-called false flags, involving dead bodies whom they would falsely claim had been killed by Ukrainians. American and British spies both believe that publicising this material robbed Moscow of the ability to justify the invasion to its own people and other countries as a defensive move. One spy says of those days before the invasion that he had never seen anything like it - highly classified material would be on his desk one day and then emerge in the public domain the next. But the unprecedented outpouring of intelligence was not enough to stop the invasion. The public release had not deterred Moscow. That may never have been possible but officials believe it did disrupt Russia's plans. And it meant the reaction across the West was swifter and more unified than it might otherwise have been, they argue. They say they made it much easier for other countries to rally round tougher measures than if there had been a confused and disputed picture of who was the real aggressor. The release has continued after the invasion in speeches, statements and briefings - the head of GCHQ claimed just over a week ago that Putin was still not getting the full picture from his own officials and there have been warnings of possible ""false flag"" use of chemical weapons. There is also a recognition of a new world in which so-called open-source intelligence - things like commercial satellite imagery and data - has made it more possible to verify or support assertions and that fighting an information war - including through intelligence - is now vital, partly to counter Russian assertions. On one level, much of the intelligence was spot-on. There was, as forecast, a full invasion from multiple directions with the purpose of toppling and replacing the Zelensky government. Western spies also correctly predicted that Moscow had misplaced confidence about the reception it would encounter. ""They genuinely believed there would be flags out to welcome them,"" says a Western intelligence officer. But one assumption did prove wrong - that Moscow's military would prevail in a matter of weeks. Instead, the war would not turn out as many expected, with Ukraine outperforming militarily while Russia underperformed. That is a reminder that intelligence has its limits - particularly in predicting some of the complexities of war and the uncertainties of people's morale and reaction. And for all its success before the war, Western spies concede that intelligence cannot tell them for sure what will happen next. "

Ukraine accused Russia of deliberately targeting civilians, but Russia denied it was behind the attack - instead saying that Kyiv was responsible. US President Joe Biden - like a number of other Western leaders - put the blame squarely on Russia, accusing it of committing a ""horrific atrocity"". Meanwhile, the UK said it was sending more anti-aircraft and anti-tank missiles to Ukraine. And Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, visited the town of Bucha, near Kyiv, where bodies of civilians were found lying in the streets after Russia's withdrawal. ""We have seen the cruel face of Putin's army,"" she said. Let's start this summary with that attack at Kramatorsk. The railway station was hit at about 10:30 local time (07:30 GMT) on Friday, Kramatorsk Mayor Oleksandr Honcharenko told the BBC. He added this happened as the crowds were ""waiting for the first train"" to be evacuated to safer regions in central and western Ukraine. Oleksandr Kamyshyn, who heads Ukraine's Ukrzaliznytsia state railway company, said two rockets struck the area. Meanwhile, Nathan Mook, an aid worker who saw people crowding at the station, counted between five and 10 explosions: ""Two minutes after we had driven by, you feel it before you hear it: the boom, the explosion."" Ukraine's prosecutor general's office later said that nearly 4,000 people - mainly women and children - were at the station at the time. Both Ukraine and Russia said Tochka-U missiles - which are known to be extremely inaccurate - were used. On Day 44 of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the BBC's Jeremy Bowen took stock of the key battlefield events so far. Predictions at the start of a quick Russian victory have been upended by the Ukrainians' willingness to fight, he says, but the war is settling into a long struggle that could still endanger the wider world. It is ironic that one of Russia President Vladimir Putin's arguments for Ukraine to be in Russia's orbit is that it is not a proper country. His own actions, along with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's well-judged messages as he leads a remarkable feat of mobilisation, are sharpening the national identity of Ukrainians. Russia suffered a serious defeat around Kyiv and had to pull back. But it has not lost the war, and is grinding out territorial gains in the east and south. Read Jeremy's article in full here Civilians who have managed to flee Mariupol in recent days have described to the BBC's Tom Bateman the increasingly desperate situation inside the besieged city, including accounts of bodies buried in shallow graves, looting by Chechen fighters, and starving residents being killed when they ventured out of shelters to find water. The evacuees' accounts are emerging as they reach the town of Zaporizhzhia, which is acting as a hub for refugees. They have risked journeys through Russian and Ukrainian lines that the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) describes as an evacuation ""from hell"". Waiting inside one aid facility was Yuliia, her two daughters and her mother Tatiana. They finally managed to escape the city on Monday. ""There are starving people,"" said Yuliia, who spoke to the BBC on condition that her surname was not used, a frequent request from residents still concerned about their safety. ""People are having mental breakdowns. There is a woman we knew who hanged herself. People are being buried in the streets."" Read evacuees' harrowing accounts in full here The Ukraine war led to a ""giant leap"" in food prices last month to another record high, the UN says. The war has cut off supplies from the world's biggest exporter of sunflower oil - which means the costs of alternatives have also climbed. Ukraine is also a major producer of cereals such as maize and wheat, which have risen sharply in price, too. The UN said ""war in the Black Sea region spread shocks through markets for staple grains and vegetable oils"". The UN Food Prices Index tracks the world's most-traded food commodities measuring the average prices of cereal, vegetable oil, dairy, meat, and sugar. Food prices are at their highest since records began 60 years ago according to the index, which jumped nearly 13% in March, following February's record high. Pink Floyd have reunited to record their first new material in 28 years - a protest song against the Ukraine war. Hey Hey, Rise Up! features David Gilmour and Nick Mason alongside long-time Floyd bassist Guy Pratt and Nitin Sawhney on keyboards. But the song is built around a spine-tingling refrain from Ukrainian singer Andriy Khlyvnyuk of the band Boombox. Gilmour says the song is a show of ""anger at a superpower invading a peaceful nation"". But it is also intended as a morale booster for the people of Ukraine, and a call ""for peace"". "

Up to 45 refugees could be housed with 16 hosts in North Moreton, Oxfordshire. Irina Kryvoviaz, 39, her son Sasha Kryvoviaz, eight, and her godson Yaroslav Kryvoshyia, 17, arrived in the UK on Thursday. They have all left relatives back in their home city of Cherkasy in central Ukraine. Mrs Kryvoviaz has had to leave family behind, including her husband. Meanwhile Mr Kryvoshyia's mother, father, and brother remain in Ukraine. ""I worry about them every minute,"" said Mrs Kryvoviaz, translated through Mr Kryvoshyia.

""People are having mental breakdowns. There is a woman we knew who hanged herself. People are being buried in the streets."" Her mother Tatiana said: ""[There are] shallow graves, half a metre deep at best, with some earth on top. Dead bodies, all over the streets."" They said many of those with no choice but to remain in basements or wrecked apartment buildings are ""the incapacitated"" - a reference to elderly and disabled people. ""People were starving… There was no re-supply. There was no humanitarian aid whatsoever. We were cooking whatever we could on bonfires. No water, no gas, no electricity, no power,"" said Yuliia. Their family survived underground for a month as Tatiana rationed the only food they had. ""Whatever we had in our fridges [when the invasion began], some porridge and butter, that's it. We were just bringing water from a well 3km away,"" Tatiana said. Her other daughter's family have not been able to leave the city. ""There is no communication. We don't know what's happened to our relatives,"" she said. This week, the UK Ministry of Defence warned that the humanitarian crisis was deepening as fierce fighting continued for control of the city and Russian forces blocked aid. The chances of getting out diminished quickly for many residents, according to the accounts to the BBC. As the full extent of the siege took hold in early March, Russian-made Grad rockets ""destroyed a lot of cars"", said Yuliia. ""When we were in Mariupol, Chechens were looting. They were taking people's gold. It was becoming really dangerous, we heard they were raping women,"" she said. ""I was frightened for my kids and I realised we had to get them out in any way possible"". The BBC cannot independently verify the claims. Chechen militants loyal to Moscow have been fighting in Ukraine since the start of the invasion and are reported to have been heavily involved in the siege of Mariupol. Elsewhere in Zaporizhzhia, aid workers have been finding homes and handing out money for evacuated families. At one refugee staging centre, Liubov, aged 61, was waiting with her son Valerii. She had a picture of their apartment block, eviscerated by shelling or an airstrike. ""On some days [there were] 50 planes, on other days 70. Each carrying two bombs. They were hitting the drama theatre, museums, hotels, apartment buildings. They didn't discriminate at all."" When the water supply stopped, Luibov said people had to choose between nothing to drink or a deadly venture outside. ""Those people who tried to get water got killed. Some people managed to bring small amounts of water for cooking,"" she said. ""We didn't have any water [for weeks]... A man went to get some, he didn't come back."" She said there were up to 300 people in some shelters. ""Russians would take them out from those shelters, take photos of those people and say, 'we came here to liberate you'. People were crying, scared to say anything back. Scared they might get executed or shot. ""The Russians would say: 'See, these are the tears of joy. People are happy to be free from the fascists'."" In the refugee staging centre, Liubov wept as she displayed the pictures on her phone, returning again and again to Mariupol's nightmare: the need for mass burials of the dead. ""They bombed and destroyed Mariupol central market, so people dug a hole in the ground where they would be bringing bodies,"" she said. ""We were told they would be buried there. But we still don't know if that happened."" Liubov and Valerii managed to escape on 19 March. They reached the city of Melekino, also under Russian control, and were searched at a checkpoint where Valerii said the soldiers made him undress. All the men in the centre reported the same thing. Russian soldiers looking for fighters strip them to their underwear searching for tattoos or rifle butt marks on men's shoulders. On Wednesday, eight buses carrying evacuees were escorted by the ICRC into Zaporizhzhia. The arrivals had all the belongings they could carry. They looked exhausted and shell-shocked. Some said the communication collapse in Mariupol is so bad they spent weeks not knowing whether the rest of the country had fallen to the Russians. One of the first off the buses was Anna. She had made her own way to the town of Berdyansk about 50 miles (80km) away, the closest the ICRC buses could get to Mariupol. ""Mariupol is a graveyard now. All the neighbourhoods are covered in the graves of civilians,"" she said. ""It was terrifying. People were sourcing water from a well."" ""Unfortunately, not everybody got out. We have relatives in Mariupol who we haven't had communications with since the end of February. We don't know if they are alive or not,"" she added. Moscow claims it has evacuated civilians held by ""Nazi battalion fighters"" in Mariupol. Ukraine says up to 40,000 people have been forcibly deported to Russia, with some held in ""filtration camps"" where they are investigated. Many people have lost contact with close relatives and have no way of knowing whether they have survived. Yevhenii Lysenko was also waiting at a refugee centre in Zaporizhzhia. He left Mariupol for a work trip before the war started. The invasion happened the day he was due to return home. He is stuck in Zaporizhzhia, and hasn't heard from his wife Svetlana since their last contact in early March. ""The message [from her] was we're being bombed,"" he said. He scrolled through pages of text messages to his wife, asking where she was, whether she was safe. ""Last time I talked to her was 2 March. So for over a month I haven't spoken to her.

""[But] if I get caught by the separatists they're going to hand me a rifle and tell me to go and shoot my own people… or execute me if I refuse to do that,"" he said. I asked what he knows about his home. He replied: ""It doesn't exist anymore, it's been destroyed by shelling or an airstrike. So essentially there is nowhere for me to return to."" "

The four ""Ukraine Assistance Centres"" will be in Belfast, Newry, Craigavon and Ballymena. They will open in stages and operate on a weekly basis, with the first centre starting work in Belfast on Monday. However, questions have been asked about why they have not open sooner, with an estimated 300 Ukrainians already in Northern Ireland. On Friday afternoon, Stormont's Executive Office confirmed the locations of each centre and their operating times for next week. The Executive Office said assistance centres will offer refugees advice on accessing public services including health, education, jobs, benefits and housing. They will also assist people with immigration issues. People attending the centres have been advised that they will need to bring identification and ""proof of the scheme under which they are registered"". Millions of people have been forced to flee Ukraine after Russia invaded in February. More than 7,000 people in Northern Ireland expressed an interest in the UK's Homes for Ukraine scheme. Refugees have started arriving, including a 31-year-old woman who completed a journey from Kyiv to south Belfast on Thursday. Her host, Alison Clarke, said she was surprised the advice centres had not yet opened. ""It's just words so far, and until they actually show up behind a desk somewhere and say 'here is your national insurance number, welcome to Northern Ireland', it's all just words."" Ms Clarke added that the young Ukrainian woman living with her was keen to start working. ""We just need to legitimise her arrival in Northern Ireland and give her access to the promised services that gives her on paper the right to work, the right to see a doctor… the stuff that everybody else here takes completely for granted and has been promised to these people."" Amnesty International is monitoring the plight of Ukrainian refugees. Patrick Corrigan, Amnesty's programme director in Northern Ireland, said: ""I know because I've received assurances from the head of the civil service that they are working with other statutory and non-statutory agencies, charities and the like here, to put in place arrangements, but we need to do it faster and better. ""We need to be ready for these people."" Welcome desks have been placed at Northern Ireland airports but many of the arrivals have come through Dublin. Belfast City Council said it was working with the Executive Office at Stormont to provide services. A council spokesperson said: ""Belfast City Council is fully engaged with the Executive Office (TEO) and other government departments to support the arrival of Ukrainian refugees to the city."" Most of the Ukrainians have come to Northern Ireland since the Russian invasion. Separately, 90 visas have been issued to refugees who say they intend to come to Northern Ireland under the Homes for Ukraine scheme. "

Sarah O'Brien, from Denbighshire, wants to help eight of the Palirua family. They have fled Bucha, where scores of atrocities by Russian soldiers against civilians have been uncovered. The family, which includes grandparents, two of their daughters and four children, escaped to Poland and have been staying in Warsaw. Mrs O'Brien, from Llangollen, said they had approached friends in Ukraine offering to help those fleeing the invasion, when the Homes for Ukraine scheme was launched by the UK government on 14 March. They were then put in touch with the Palirua family. But after three weeks and hours working on applications, only five of the family have received their visa papers to come to Wales. Mrs O'Brien said the Ukraine family have been told they must leave their current accommodation in Warsaw by Sunday, and need urgent help getting permission to come to Britain. ""It was a five-hour process to fill in the eight visas, but it will be three weeks this coming Friday and we are still outstanding three of the visas,"" said Mrs O'Brien. ""In fact, one of the visas has been issued twice, so that's how the system isn't working."" Mrs O'Brien dubbed the situation ""desperate"". The Ukraine family include husband and wife Volodymyr, 75, and Lidiia Paliura, 68, and there two adult daughters, Tetiana and Nataliia. Their daughters have four children with them - Hlib, Andrii, Anastasiia, and Kateryna - who are between six and 15. ""They want to stay together, but if they are moving out of this accommodation (in Warsaw), they are uncertain what other accommodation they will have,"" Mrs O'Brien said. The O'Brien family have offered the refugees a cottage next to their own home, and additional bedrooms in their own house too. ""The situation is so desperate over there. They are from Bucha, their home town has been destroyed,"" said Mrs O'Brien. ""When you see the news, it's just so horrific. ""As soon as we realised we could host them, we wanted to help."" Mrs O'Brien said they were ""pushing hard"" to get the visas issued, and were being supported by the Clwyd South MP Simon Baynes. A UK government spokesman said: ""We acknowledge progress approving visas has not been good enough. ""The Home Office has made changes to visa processing - the application form has been streamlined, Ukrainian passport holders can now apply online and do their biometrics checks once in the UK, and greater resource has gone into the system. ""This is allowing us to welcome people faster, while still maintaining security checks which ensure those who could pose a threat to our safety are prevented from getting here and human trafficking is addressed.""

The prime minister said the UK will send additional military equipment including Starstreak anti-aircraft missiles and 800 anti-tank missiles. It comes after dozens of people died when a crowded railway station in eastern Ukraine was hit by rockets. Vladimir Putin's daughters have also been sanctioned by the UK. Speaking at a Downing Street press conference with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, Mr Johnson warned Russia will not escape punishment after the attack at Kramatorsk station. He said: ""I know that Britain and Germany share exactly the same sense of horror and revulsion at the brutality unleashed including the unconscionable bombing of refugees fleeing their homes this morning. ""It is a war crime indiscriminately to attack civilians, and Russia's war crimes in Ukraine will not go unnoticed or unpunished."" Mr Johnson added the UK will send precision munitions ""capable of lingering in the sky until directed to their target"" and more helmets, body armour, and night vision. Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said the UK will also be providing Ukraine with armoured Mastiff vehicles to fight Russia's invasion. Mastiffs are heavily armoured vehicles suitable for road patrols and convoys. The vehicles will be stripped of sensitive equipment and British troops will help with training in a neighbouring country, the Times reported. Earlier, the Foreign Office announced fresh sanctions on Mr Putin's daughters, Katerina Vladimirovna Tikhonova, 35, and Maria Vladimirovna Vorontsova, 36. They will be subject to travel bans and asset freezes, the government said. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said the move ensures those benefitting from Mr Putin's rule will ""feel consequences"". Meanwhile, the daughter of Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov, Yekaterina Sergeyevna Vinokurova, 39, has also been sanctioned. It comes after the three women were sanctioned by the United States on Wednesday. Ms Truss said: ""By freezing the assets and limiting the travel of Putin's allies, the UK government is sealing off reservoirs of cash funding the conflict, while also making sure those who have benefited from Putin's rule feel the consequences. ""Oligarchs and other wealthy Russians are amongst those hit hardest by the sanctions, which have drastically limited their access to luxury consumer goods and access to international markets."" The UK government said £275bn of Russian foreign currency reserves, representing 60% of its total, have been frozen due to UK and international sanctions. It added the sanctions were having ""deep and damaging consequences for Putin's ability to wage war"". More than 1,200 individuals and businesses have been targeted by the UK, including Chelsea FC owner Roman Abramovich and Mr Lavrov's stepdaughter Polina Kovaleva. "

Joanne Turner from Norwich said the refugees made their application as soon as the scheme opened on 18 March. But three weeks on, Iryna, her daughter Sofia and her mother Elena are still stuck sharing a flat with a Polish family in Krakow. ""The feeling of uncertainty is the most frustrating,"" says Irina. A government spokesperson said it had launched one of the ""fastest and biggest visa schemes in UK history"" following the invasion. But as Home Secretary Priti Patel apologised for visa delays, Joanne told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that it felt as if their application was getting ""nowhere, really"". She said they had made the application ""as soon as the lines were first open"" and had prepared their home, passing checks to ensure they had suitable accommodation. ""We had hoped that in a few days Iryna and her mum, Elena, and her little girl Sofia, would be with us in Norwich,"" she said. ""Everything is ready."" But it was impossible to get a timeframe from the authorities, Joanne said, describing the responses from the government helpline as ""pretty crazy stuff"". ""We've been trying everything. There's a government helpline that you can get through to. I called them and they basically said we can't give you any information,"" she said. ""They were basically saying we are told to say nothing, we can't give any information on the status of the application."" Joanne said the process is ""frustrating"" for her, ""but for Iryna and her family and all the other families that are trying to get to the UK, it's torturous really"". She told the BBC that they had shared photos of their house and their dog, an Irish setter called Rathlin, with the family as they waited. ""Her little girl just wants to meet our dog,"" said Joanne. In the meantime, Iryna and her family are sharing an apartment in Krakow with a Polish family. She said the family have been kind but have been asking her how long she needs to stay and she doesn't know the answer. ""We expected to stay here a few days until all the documents were going to be ready. But it seems the time is going to be prolonged for a few weeks, not a couple of days,"" Iryna said. ""The feeling of uncertainty is the most frustrating, because if we knew how long it's going to be - a few more days, a few more weeks... Nobody is able to provide you with exact information about the timing."" She said her daughter is seven and has now missed more than a month of school since the invasion began. They could not make any permanent arrangements in Poland because the country, which has seen more than 2.5 million cross the border since Russia attacked, is ""overloaded with other Ukrainian refugees"", Iryna said. But she said she was ""grateful"" for the ""proactive"" efforts of British people and said she hoped it would be possible to find shelter in a few days. The government spokesperson added: ""In just four weeks, over 40,000 visas have been issued so people can rebuild their lives in the UK through the Ukraine Family Scheme and Homes for Ukraine. ""We are continuing to speed up visa processing across both schemes, including boosting caseworkers and simplifying the forms and we expect thousands more to come through these uncapped routes."" "

777,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-61027292,2022-04-08T14:29:05,Ukraine: Six weeks of devastation and defiance as world grapples with the crisis," Predictions at the start of the invasion of a quick Russian victory have been upended by the Ukrainians' willingness to fight, but the war is settling into a long struggle that could still endanger the wider world too. Remember how it was in Kyiv after the Russians invaded: thousands cramming bitterly cold railway platforms, pushing and shoving to get any train heading away from the Russians. At the height of it, in the week that straddled the end of February and the beginning of March, 50,000 people were moving west from Kyiv station every single day. Rusty carriages that looked as if they had spent years pensioned off in some siding were hauled back into service so the railway company could lay on dozens of extra services. Most of the passengers were women and children. Men stayed. The law stated they could not leave the country as Ukraine needed them to fight. I did not see any press gangs. Mostly, it was a nation of willing volunteers. Kyiv's population of around four million halved. Some of the women who didn't leave put on uniforms to fight. Outside a volunteer centre I met a woman called Katrine hugging Nikita, her 18-month-old son. It was a brief reunion as her unit rotated through Kyiv. Katrine was a sniper, who said she was ready to kill to give her son a future. As I drove into Kyiv from the south a few days into the invasion, a Russian convoy 40 miles long was heading towards the city from the north and north-west, from Belarus, Russia's ally. Belarus is the sort of neighbour Russia's President Vladimir Putin wants. Its leader, Alexander Lukashenko, is happy to have Putin's patronage and to accept a role as Russia's client state. Even so Lukashenko did not send his troops into Ukraine, which many outsiders had assumed was part of the Kremlin's battle plan. Perhaps even Putin accepted that loyalty has its limits. Everyone in Kyiv feared the worst. The city centre was mostly empty, except for armed and anxious men at checkpoints who were ready to believe that anyone behaving in a way they didn't like was a Russian saboteur. The rumble of explosions rolled in from the edge of the city. Everyone feared the all-powerful Russians were about to encircle Kyiv and attack. On my first night I decided not to sleep in the hotel shelter, at the second basement level. It was overcrowded and airless, and the city centre had not been hit. It felt like a gamble. But as I write this, six weeks later, in the same hotel room on the fourth floor, Kyiv's beautiful and historic centre has still not been attacked, even though it is well within range of Russia's missiles and air force. In six weeks, so much has changed. The long convoy got bogged down and destroyed. The Russians retreated. The war is far from over, but the Ukrainians won the battle of Kyiv. The first battle. There could be another. Ukrainian willingness to fight and die upended every prediction of a swift Russian victory. At a military funeral of a soldier killed stopping the Russian advance, his mother and sister sobbed, clutching his portrait. Volleys were fired over his coffin, and hundreds of his comrades lined up to sing their national anthem and roar patriotic slogans. They looked like who they were, volunteers with ages that ran from late teens to late middle age, wearing a range of uniforms and carrying a variety of weapons. Ukraine also has much more professional-looking, highly trained soldiers. Together with clever leadership, sharp tactics and Nato weapons they have fought so well that the world's perception of their country has changed. At a photo opportunity at the Nato meeting in Brussels this week foreign ministers of some of the world's most powerful democracies were jostling to get close to the guest of honour, their Ukrainian counterpart Dmytro Kuleba. Differences are emerging in the North Atlantic Alliance and the European Union about how to increase the pressure on Russia, but they all wanted a little Ukrainian stardust. In war, leadership has always been critical, and in modern war the messages on the media battlefield are more significant than ever. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky is winning that part of the war. Instead of heading for safer ground he stayed, swapping suits for khaki t-shirts. It is ironic that one of Putin's arguments for Ukraine to be in Russia's orbit is that it is not a proper country. His own actions, along with Zelensky's well-judged messages as he leads a remarkable feat of mobilisation, are sharpening the national identity of Ukrainians. Another factor for Ukrainian success is that humans caught up in wars adapt fast, once the shock wears off. In a trendy part of Kyiv hipster craft makers repurposed their workshop to turn out steel barriers with vicious spikes to rip tyres. In the basement of a volunteer depot young women tore up sheets to make fuses for Molotov cocktails. The air in the unventilated space was heavy with petrol vapour. Checkpoints in Kyiv went from jumpy armed men with barriers made of a few tyres - to well-fortified sandbagged strongpoints. Ukrainian defiance has also been a key factor. Thousands of volunteers signed up to learn how to handle weapons and fight. Among them were two young men we've followed ever since, university students Dmytro Kisilenko, aged 18, and his friend Maksym Lutsyk, who's 19. When they signed up to fight at the beginning of March the volunteers of their age looked like young guys off to a festival. Now they have seen action on the front line, and like every other Ukrainian have had their view of the world and the lives they will lead in it shaken. The two young soldiers, Maksym and Dmytro, have been in Kyiv this week buying the new gear they'll need when they're rotated into the battles of the east in a few days. For Maksym, like all Ukrainians, this is the fight of their lives. ""We are not fighting here only for our country's life, we are fighting for the life of the whole civilised world because the biggest goal for us is to defend our freedoms and rights in Europe, in and out of our country. Every one of us understands that there will not be freedom in the whole world while Russia occupies our territories."" Weeks as a frontline soldier have changed Dmytro. ""Human life matters, your relatives or friends. Your country matters, first of all… I become more systematic and unfortunately more ruthless because of the latest news and what I have already been through. Ruthless to Russian soldiers, ruthless to all the situations. I've become more like a soldier."" Russia suffered a serious defeat around Kyiv and had to pull back. But it has not lost the war, and is grinding out territorial gains in the east and south. Since they left the Kyiv Oblast the damage they have done is clearer than ever. The damage to property is extensive. I have seen terrible devastation in the centres of towns like Irpin and Borodyanka. Far more serious, and alarming, is what has been done to civilians and other non-combatants. I have seen dead bodies, some definitely civilians, left where they were killed by the Russians. The evidence that war crimes were perpetrated by Russian troops is becoming overwhelming. Accusations have also been levelled at Ukrainian forces, after a video emerged that appeared to show their soldiers killing wounded Russians who were lying helpless on the ground. This war is a world crisis not just because the Russians have driven a tank through international law, or for what they have done to civilians, but because it has brought the biggest military powers with nuclear weapons closer to a potential confrontation than at any time since the Cold War that ended with the fall of the Soviet Union, culminating in 1991. The 21st Century now has its own Cold War, with the same risks attached if it gets hot. The head of defence intelligence in Ukraine, Maj Gen Kyrylo Budanov, told me that the risks of not confronting Putin's Russia are much worse for Nato than risking escalation by standing up to him and sending Ukraine the much more lethal arsenal it wants. ""This is a war of aggression in the heart of Europe that completely destroys existing political and military security systems. If the world swallows Putin's aggression and offers no radical solution, it will be repeated over and over again,"" he said. Kyiv is much calmer now than in the icy first days of the invasion. It's very different in the east, where soldiers are gathering, and thousands of civilians are leaving everything they've ever known. The invasion of Ukraine took many by surprise. But the crisis between Russia and the West was brewing for years. Many, not just politicians, refused to recognise the signs. A collective amnesia settled over the wars of former Yugoslavia of the 1990s. Europe, it was assumed, was too wise, rich and self-interested to still be that old continent where blood could be spilled to change borders and topple governments. Now we know that view was complacent and wrong. Western leaders are having to think very hard and very quickly about how to readjust to this new era's challenges and dangers. This is going to be a long, attritional struggle. The stakes are high. If it escalates into a fight to the finish between Putin's presidency and Ukraine's independence the wider world will face even worse danger. © 2022 BBC.

778,https://www.bbc.com/news/60555166,2022-04-08T14:17:30,How do the UK's schemes for Ukrainian refugees work?," The UK has been widely criticised for not allowing as many Ukrainian refugees to enter as some other European states. Family visa scheme The family visa scheme is for Ukrainians with a family member in the UK. That family member must have British nationality, indefinite leave to remain, settled status or proof of permanent residence. It was launched at the beginning of March, and extended after criticism that it excluded some close family members. Ukrainian refugees are advised to apply at a Visa Application Centre (VAC) in countries including Poland, Romania, Hungary and Moldova. They need to provide biometric information, such as fingerprints. Applications from refugees with a Ukrainian passport can be made online, with biometric information provided after arrival in the UK. As of 7 April, the UK had issued 28,500 visas under this scheme from 36,300 applications. However, only 10,800 have arrived in the UK under this scheme so far. Sponsorship scheme The ""Homes for Ukraine"" scheme lets people in the UK host Ukrainians refugees who are known to them, but who do not have family ties here. It was launched on 14 March, and more than 100,000 people and organisations signed up within the first day. Under the scheme, people are asked to offer Ukrainians a rent-free space in their home or a separate residence for at least six months. They will not be expected to provide food and living expenses but can choose to do so. Those offering to host a refugee will be vetted by the government and Ukrainian applicants will undergo security checks. Each household housing a refugee will be offered £350 a month, tax-free, for up to 12 months. Local authorities will also receive £10,500 in extra funding per refugee for support services, with more for children of school age. However, some families who have applied to be sponsors have complained that the system is overly complicated. Government figures show that as of 7 April, 12,500 sponsorship visas had been issued from 43,600 applications. However, only 1,200 refugees have arrived in the UK so far under the sponsorship visas. The Home Office has been accused of a chaotic and overly-bureaucratic response. EU countries are allowing Ukrainian refugees in for up to three years without a visa, and more than four million people have fled to neighbouring countries since the Russian invasion. Poland has taken more than 2.5 million refugees, and Romania more than 650,000. As of 7 April, 40,900 UK visas had been issued in total, but only 12,000 have reached the UK so far. On 8 April, Home Secretary Priti Patel apologised ""with frustration"" for visa delays. On 26 February, Home Office minister Kevin Foster was widely criticised after highlighting the government's Seasonal Worker visa, which allows people to apply to come to the UK to pick fruit and vegetables. His tweet was subsequently deleted. There have been complaints that the UK visa process is too complicated - one British man told the BBC it had taken 72 hours to get a visa for his Ukrainian step-daughter, who had fled to Romania. There have also been reports of refugees who have got as far as Calais, before being turned away by Border Force officials for not having the right paperwork. On 7 March, Home Secretary Priti Patel told MPs ""we have set up a bespoke VAC en route to Calais"". But the Home Office did not confirm that this was the case. The government then opened a VAC in Lille on 10 March - around 70 miles away from Calais. The Home Office said it would deal with ""a limited number of cases"" - referred to it by Border Force officials - and advised applicants not to travel there. In addition to the lengthy paperwork refugees must submit to obtain both types of visas, government guidance for the Homes for Ukraine scheme states that applicants ""will be subject to a range of checks"". These can include: It is likely that the vetting process will exacerbate what already seems to be a long and complex visa application process. The government has faced pressure - including from some Conservative MPs - to issue emergency visas or lift visa requirements altogether for Ukrainian refugees. Home Secretary Priti Patel has ruled this out, insisting that ""security and biometric checks"" were vital to keep British citizens safe. The government also says that some people in Calais claiming to be Ukrainians have presented false documents. Boris Johnson has defended the current visa rules, saying: ""People want us to be generous but also careful."" He has also repeatedly talked about the government's ""proud record"" on refugees since 2015, telling MPs ""we've done more to resettle vulnerable people than any other European country since 2015"". However, this only refers to one specific category - ""resettled refugees"". Other European countries have taken in larger numbers of refugees in general. "

The number is more than double last week's total of 210, Home Office figures show. The latest statistics include 35 refugees whose applications have been approved under the Scottish government's super sponsor scheme. It removes the need for individuals to be matched prior to being given permission to travel. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon told BBC Scotland the process of granting visas remained ""painfully slow"". Ms Sturgeon said the super sponsor scheme, which has involved close co-operation with the UK government, should allow people a faster route to Scotland. And she said a support structure was in place to help refugees when they arrive. But she added: ""The bit in the middle is the granting of the visas and we hope to see that speed up. ""I know there is work being done at UK government level to try to speed it up but, and I think UK government ministers would admit this themselves, that bit remains too cumbersome and it is taking far too long. ""We need to see real progress there."" Across the UK, the Home Office said 40,900 visas for Ukrainians have now been issued and 12,000 people have arrived from Ukraine. In an interview with BBC News, Home Secretary Priti Patel has apologised ""with frustration"" for delays to the visa system that have prevented thousands of Ukrainian refugees from coming to the UK. Of the visas issued, 28,500 were under the Ukraine Family Scheme and 12,500 were under the Homes for Ukraine scheme, which allows people to sponsor Ukrainian refugees. The data, up to 7 April, also reveals that 10,800 people have now arrived in the UK under the family scheme and 1,200 under the sponsorship scheme. Valerie Semchuk arrived in Aberdeen with her two sons on 20 March to stay with relatives and is now helping to package vital supplies that will be sent back to her homeland via Poland. Her husband, who is a builder, has stayed behind in Kyiv. Ms Semchuk has visited Scotland before, but this time is different. She told BBC Scotland: ""This time is not like others because I am not happy to be here. ""It is so stressful and I am so nervous. I want home all the time. ""I miss my husband."" Asked why she is helping to put aid parcels together, she said: ""I have to do it. It is for my country, for my people"" "

With many Ukrainian regions banning sales of alcohol after the Russian invasion 44 days ago, Kyiv-based Varvar Brew was left with unsold stock. Hertfordshire-based beer wholesaler Euroboozer arranged for the equivalent of 45,000 pints to be driven to the UK. Pubs and shops around the country will sell the beers, with hundreds of drinks already pre-ordered by customers. Bier Huis, an off-licence in Ossett, West Yorkshire, said it had sold most of its share already. David Jones, Bier Huis' owner, said: ""There's a number of breweries in Ukraine and they need to shift that beer to keep their company afloat and provide support for Ukrainian people. ""No-one will make any cash on it, it will all go back to help with the war effort."" Euroboozer said the truck containing pints left the Ukrainian capital on 31 March. The 370-mile (600 km) journey to Poland usually takes about 10 hours, the wholesaler said, but this trip took five days. Martin Dawson, of Varvar Brew, said: ""The situation in Kyiv is unpredictable, and we don't know exactly how many days we will still be able to get our hands on our beer. ""Hopefully each and every beer that leaves the country can provide real enjoyment but also play a role in keeping our fight at the front of people's minds."" The lorry reached Calais in France on Thursday, the wholesaler said, with customers able to make additional donations on top of the beer price.

Ukraine is also a major producer of cereals such as maize and wheat which have risen sharply in price too. The UN said ""war in the Black Sea region spread shocks through markets for staple grains and vegetable oils"". The UN Food Prices Index tracks the world's most-traded food commodities measuring the average prices of cereal, vegetable oil, dairy, meat, and sugar. Food prices are at their highest since records began 60 years ago according to the index, which jumped nearly 13% in March, following February's record high. The price of vegetable oils soared 23% while cereals were up 17%. Sugar rose 7%, meat was up 5%, while dairy - which has been less affected by the war - only climbed 3%. Food commodity prices were already at 10-year highs before the war in Ukraine according to the index because of global harvest issues. That has fuelled a cost-of-living crisis that is worrying politicians and has sparked warnings of social unrest across the world. In the UK, industry experts have warned that the cost of food could rise by up to 15% this year. The UN's Food and Agricultural Organisation warned last month that food prices could rise by up to 20% as a result of the conflict in Ukraine, raising the risk of increased malnutrition across the world. It has cut its world wheat projection for 2022 from 790 million tonnes to 784 million, because of the possibility that at least 20% of Ukraine's winter crop will not be harvested because of ""direct destruction"". But it said global cereal stocks could end the year 2.4% higher than the start because of stockpiles building up in Russia and Ukraine as both countries exports would shrink. "

Svitlana and Yulia Derkach were invited backstage by the songwriter as they attended his gig at the Usher Hall with their hosts, Jacquie and Colin Clayton. Savoretti contacted the family after he read their story on the BBC Scotland news website. Ms Clayton said he gave them an unforgettable night. ""Jack and his team were just wonderful and really hospitable,"" she said. ""He was a true gentleman and very empathetic towards the girls. ""It was such a welcome change from what they have endured over the last few months and I am sure they will remember it always."" Svitlana, 25, said: ""The concert was really moving. ""It was heartbreaking for me because Jack dedicated a song to Ukraine. It was very emotional."" The sisters are originally from Zhytomyr, a city about 120km (75 miles) west of Kyiv. They were both based in the Ukrainian capital when the Russian invasion was launched on 24 February. But their parents stayed behind to look after elderly relatives despite the region coming under heavy bombardment. Ms Clayton was moved to sign up for the Homes for Ukraine scheme after she travelled to Krakow to help out in a soup kitchen as the humanitarian crisis unfolded. On 27 March Svitlana and Yulia, 18, arrived in Scotland to stay with Ms Clayton and her husband. Last week BBC Scotland told how Svitlana was working as a paralegal when Russia launched the invasion that she never imagined was possible. She said: ""It was really a shock to wake up from my father's call at 5am to say: 'The war has started. Pack your things and get out of the city'. ""It was really hard to stay in Kyiv and very dangerous."" Yulia was studying geography and English at a university in Kyiv when the conflict started. She admitted the experience of moving to a new country at a time of great uncertainty in her homeland had been stressful. But she added: ""The moment I saw our sponsors I felt really relieved because they met us with such warmth and love and I did not expect this."" "

Jane Finlay criticised the government for difficulties she had trying to bring over a family from Ukraine. Ms Finlay, 56, said there was also ""no assistance"" from the government in finding a family to house. The government said the visa scheme began in ""record time"" but acknowledged progress was ""not good enough"". ""I have a degree, three of the family members are graduates, and it still took us 11 hours to fill in the forms,"" Ms Finlay said. ""There's really generous members of the UK public trying to do something and the government has done absolutely nothing apart from set this website up where we register."" Ms Finlay turned to Facebook where she connected with a woman called Nadia who was looking for help. ""They had to provide information such as the father of the 16-year-old had to give written permission that she could leave the country, in English, but he's fighting in Ukraine, so it's a ridiculous thing to ask,"" Ms Finlay added. She said parts of the questionnaire were ""irrelevant"" and the information being required in PDF format meant another layer of complexity. Nadia, whose last name has not been given for safeguarding reasons, was looking to seek refuge in the UK along with her 16-year-old daughter, her sister-in-law and her 31-year-old niece after Russia launched a war with Ukraine in February. Once the visas were approved, Ms Finlay left her home in Cornwall and flew to Berlin on 21 March. From there she travelled to the border in Medyka, Poland, with her friend Pete Jones to collect Nadia and her family before going to a visa processing centre in Berlin. Ms Finlay said she eventually travelled with the family from Calais to Folkestone on 31 March - nine days after meeting them at the border. The family has now settled with Ms Finlay and her partner Michael Whitehill in Cornwall. A Government spokesperson said: ""The Homes for Ukraine scheme was set up in record time but we acknowledge progress approving visas has not been good enough."" They added that changes have been made and the process ""streamlined"". A partnership with the charity Reset Communities and Refugees had been set up to fund and provide a matching service for sponsors and refugees.

Hey Hey, Rise Up! features David Gilmour and Nick Mason alongside long-time Floyd bassist Guy Pratt and Nitin Sawhney on keyboards. But the song is built around a spine-tingling refrain from Ukrainian singer Andriy Khlyvnyuk of the band Boombox. Gilmour says the song is a show of ""anger at a superpower invading a peaceful nation"". But it is also intended as a morale booster for the people of Ukraine, and a call ""for peace"". Work on the song began a couple of weeks ago, when Gilmour was shown Khlyvnyuk's Instagram feed. The singer had posted footage of himself in in Kyiv's Sofiyskaya Square, fully armed and ready to fight the Russian invasion. Facing the camera, Khlyvnyuk sang The Red Viburnum In The Meadow, a protest song written during the first world war, which has become a rallying cry in Ukraine over last six weeks. ""It just struck me that, as it is a capella, one could turn this into a beautiful song,"" Gilmour told BBC 6 Music's Matt Everitt. By coincidence, Gilmour had performed live with BoomBox in 2015, at a London benefit gig for the Belarus Free Theatre - and he contacted Khlyvnyuk to seek permission. ""I spoke to him, actually, from his hospital bed, where he had a pretty minor injury from a mortar,"" the star said. ""So he's right there on the front line. ""I played him a little bit of the song down the phone line and he gave me his blessing."" The song was released at midnight on Friday, with proceeds going to humanitarian relief. The song carries special significance for Gilmour, as his daughter-in-law is the Ukrainian-born artist Janina Pedan. He told the BBC she had inspired the artwork for the single, which contains the national flower of Ukraine, the sunflower. ""My daughter-in-law told us the story of a woman at the beginning of this conflict, giving sunflower seeds to Russian soldiers and saying that she hoped that sunflowers would sprout where they died."" Gilmour said he found the ""powerlessness of the West"" in the face of Russian aggression ""infuriating"" but said he supported the ongoing sanctions against the country. ""It's a shame that the people who suffer most are the ordinary people of Russia - but that is the way the sanctions work. It helps to create a discontent in that country which will hopefully, at some point, create some sort of change of regime."" Asked how he felt about the UK government's response to the crisis, he expressed frustration at the bureaucracy facing Ukrainian refugees who want to settle here. ""A lot of Europe is saying 'welcome' and our [government] is saying, 'you need to get onto a computer and fill in forms'. ""My view would be to open the doors and sort of paperwork out later. But government doesn't seem to be following that way of thinking."" Roger Waters does not feature on the new recording - he left the band in 1985 and has only occasionally performed with them since, such as at the Live 8 concert in 2005.

787,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-61033173,2022-04-08T04:44:06,Ukraine War: Kremlin spokesman Peskov admits 'significant' Russian losses," Russia has admitted suffering ""significant losses of troops"" in Ukraine, as the invasion enters its 44th day. Presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov told British channel Sky News the casualties were ""a huge tragedy for us"". He said he hoped Moscow would reach its war goals ""in the coming days"". Mr Peskov's comments followed Russia's expulsion from the United Nations Human Rights council on Wednesday. Some 93 of the 193 members of the UN General Assembly voted in favour of the diplomatic rebuke, which followed allegations of mass human rights abuses by Russian troops in the formerly occupied town of Bucha in northern Ukraine. Moscow announced its resignation from the council in response. The body expressed its ""grave concern at the ongoing human rights and humanitarian crisis"", and Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky accused Russia of further atrocities in Borodyanka, a town near the capital Kyiv. Mr Peskov denied any suggestion that Russian troops were responsible for executions in the town of Bucha and told the broadcaster that ""we're living in days of fakes and lies"". He baselessly claimed that images of civilians murdered in the town were staged. However, his admission that Russia has suffered significant casualties is striking. On 25 March, Russia's Ministry of Defence said 1,351 of its soldiers had been killed in combat. Ukraine puts the Russian deaths at almost 19,000. Neither Russia nor Ukraine's estimates of Russian losses can be independently verified - and analysts have cautioned that Russia may be downplaying its casualty rate, while Ukraine could be inflating it to boost morale. Western leaders believe that between 7,000 and 15,000 Russian soldiers have been killed. Mr Peskov, who has served as Russian President Vladimir Putin's spokesperson since 2000, also claimed that Russia is searching for ways to end the war. ""Our military are doing their best to bring an end to that operation,"" he said. ""And we do hope that in coming days, in the foreseeable future, this operation will reach its goals or will finish it by the negotiations between Russian and Ukrainian delegation."" Russia has pulled troops away from Kyiv and shifted most of the focus of its war to eastern Ukraine - but the fighting shows no signs of ending. Ukraine's deputy prime minister has urged Ukrainians living in the east to flee while they still can, and the intensity of the shelling there is already hampering evacuations. On Thursday, Western nations imposed further sanctions on the Russian economy in retaliation for alleged war crimes in Ukraine. The US Senate voted unanimously to remove Moscow's ""most favoured nation"" trade status, opening the door to damaging new tariffs and import controls on products like platinum, chemicals, iron and steel. And the EU agreed to gradually impose a ban on imports of Russian coal, worth around $4bn (£3.3bn) a year to the Russian economy, over the next 120 days. Speaking to Russia's parliament, the state Duma, Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin admitted that the cumulative impact of extensive sanctions means the country is facing its worst economic outlook in decades. ""No doubt, the current situation could be called the most difficult in three decades for Russia,"" he said. ""Such sanctions were not used even in the darkest times of the Cold War."" But he claimed that the impact of Western sanctions has been limited, telling MPs that the ""financial system, the lifeblood of the entire economy, has held up"". After collapsing to a historic low at the end of February, Russia's currency the rouble has rebounded to its pre-war level. Ukraine's President Zelensky has renewed his calls for fresh supplies of heavy weapons from the West, saying his forces need ""weapons which will give it the means to win on the battlefield and that will be the strongest possible sanction against Russia"".

Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said the battle for the Donbas region would remind the world of World War Two. Mr Kuleba asked Nato countries to provide weapons to fight the Russians. The Western alliance's secretary general said Nato was ready to strengthen support, even though he did not give details on what weapons it would provide. As more details emerge of atrocities in the areas once controlled by the Russians, the UN General Assembly voted to suspend Moscow from the Human Rights Council. The Kremlin described the vote as ""illegal"". Here are some of the highlights of Thursday's developments: On Day 43 of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, a BBC team visited the northern village of Yahidne, which was occupied by Russian soldiers for nearly a month. When the Russians entered, they took men, women and children from their homes at gunpoint and held them in the basement of the local school for four weeks - around 130 people cramped into a room roughly 65 sq m (700 sq ft) in size. ""This was my half a metre of space. I was sleeping standing up,"" says Mykola Klymchuk, who survived the ordeal. ""I tied myself to the railing here with my scarf so I wouldn't fall over. I spent 25 nights like this."" Mykola said you couldn't move at all for fear of stepping on people. When people died, the bodies couldn't immediately be removed. Russian soldiers would not allow it every day. And because of the constant fighting outside - mortar shelling, explosions and gunfire - it was dangerous as well. Sharing space with the dead - horror outside Chernihiv Russian troops were heard discussing killing civilians in the Ukrainian town of Bucha, in messages intercepted by German intelligence, German media say. Der Spiegel magazine says some of the radio traffic tracked by the BND intelligence agency appears to match locations of bodies just outside Kyiv. The BND has so far made no public comments on the issue. Ukraine says more than 300 civilians were killed by the Russians in Bucha - Moscow denies any involvement. Recent images of Bucha streets strewn with bodies have shocked the international community. Some of the victims appeared to have been shot in the back of the head after their hands were tied. Read the full story here The Bucha killings have sparked widespread accusations of war crimes - with some voices arguing that Moscow has gone even further. ""That is real genocide, what you have seen here,"" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said during a visit to Bucha. Poland's Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki agrees the killings in Bucha and other towns near the capital ""must be called acts of genocide and be dealt with as such"". And UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said attacks on civilians in Bucha do not ""look far short of genocide"". But the US and the West's Nato military alliance have stopped short of using the word to describe what's happening in Ukraine. So is there a case for accusing Russian forces of committing what has been called the ""crime of all crimes""? Footage has emerged which purports to show Ukrainian forces shooting and killing a captive Russian soldier. It was filmed on a road to the west of the Ukrainian capital Kyiv, where Russian forces have been retreating. Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said on Thursday he was aware of the video and it would ""definitely be investigated"". The BBC has been analysing the footage - here is what we have found out so far. Russia's military offensive in eastern Ukraine is already intensifying. You can see it in the long queues of traffic driving west towards relative safety. You can feel it in the deserted streets as you drive through the towns and cities of the Donbas. And you can hear it with the increasing sound of Russian artillery. Russia is redeploying more of its forces from northern to eastern Ukraine. The objective is to step up the battle in the Luhansk and Donetsk - parts of which were already controlled by Russian backed separatists. Ukraine has already lost ground to Russia. But they are digging in for the fight. As we travelled east towards the frontline we saw new defensive positions and trenches being dug. Read Jonathan's analysis here. Russia's Nobel Peace Prize winning journalist Dmitry Muratov says he has been attacked with red paint laced with the solvent acetone aboard a train. ""My eyes are burning terribly,"" said the editor of the Novaya Gazeta liberal newspaper, which has halted its operations after warning from Moscow over its Russia-Ukraine war coverage. The male attacker shouted, ""Muratov, this is for our boys,"" he said. Novaya Gazeta is known for being highly critical of the Russian authorities.

Last month, it announced it was suspending its print and online operation ""until the end of Russia's special military operation"" in Ukraine - the official term Russia's media regulator Roskomnadzor says all media outlets in the country must use. Anyone who describes Russia's actions in Ukraine as a ""war"" faces heavy fines or closures. The incident happened on Thursday on the Moscow-Samara train, Mr Muratov said. Pictures of the aftermath of the attack were published on the Telegram channel of Novaya Gazeta. Europe The outlet has been launched by a team of journalists from Novaya Gazeta. They say it will be operating outside Russia, publishing articles in different languages. Mr Muratov was co-awarded the peace prize in 2021 in recognition of his fight to defend freedom of expression in Russia. Since the start of the Russian invasion of Ukraine on 24 February, restrictions on reporting have been increasingly severe in Russia, and access to almost all independent outlets is blocked or limited - or they censor themselves. Russia has also banned Facebook, Instagram and Twitter in the country. A number of Russian activists and journalists speaking out against their country's invasion of Ukraine have recently had their homes vandalised by unknown pro-Kremlin figures. Since the war began, life for those who oppose it has become increasingly difficult in Russia. The government has passed a law threatening people who spread ""fake"" information about the war with 15 years in prison. President Vladimir Putin and other politicians have painted any opposition to the war as a betrayal of the country. "
793,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-61030090,2022-04-07T19:18:26,Ukraine war: Sharing space with the dead - horror outside Chernihiv," On the white, damp wall of the Yahidne school basement is a crude calendar, drawn in red crayon. It marks a period of unimaginable trauma - from 5 March to 2 April - for the people of this village. Yahidne, 140km (80 miles) north of Kyiv and just outside the city of Chernihiv which is close to the borders with Belarus and Russia, was occupied by Russian soldiers for nearly a month. When they entered, they took men, women and children from their homes at gunpoint and held them in the basement of the local school for four weeks - around 130 people cramped into a room roughly 65 sq m (700 sq ft) in size. Sixty-year-old Mykola Klymchuk was one of them. He offered to show us the basement. As we climbed down a short flight of stairs, we began to smell the stench of disease and decay. The room was dirty - some mattresses, clothes, shoes and books were strewn on the floor, there were four small cots in the centre and a stash of utensils in one corner. Mykola took us straight to the far end of the room. ""This was my half a metre of space. I was sleeping standing up,"" he said. His voice choked up and he started crying. ""I tied myself to the railing here with my scarf so I wouldn't fall over. I spent 25 nights like this."" Mykola said you couldn't move at all for fear of stepping on people. About 40 or 50 children were among those held captive, including babies. The youngest was just two months old. Russian forces were quick to reach villages such as Yahidne as they launched their assault on Chernihiv. For weeks the city of about 300,000 people was cut off as Russian forces surrounded and bombed it, having met resistance. They also destroyed a bridge on the road to the capital Kyiv, leaving residents with nowhere to flee. Now the Russians have withdrawn following their failure to take Kyiv. The BBC is one of the first news organisations to reach the area and the horror of what happened under both occupation and bombardment can be revealed. So close to the border, people worry too that the Russians could soon return. Fifteen-year-old Anastasiia was in the Yahidne basement along with her father and grandmother. ""There was barely any room. We were living sitting up. We were sleeping sitting up. Not that we slept at all. It was impossible. So many shells were landing around here. It was unbearable,"" she said. The room had no ventilation. Its two windows were boarded up. ""During my time here, 12 people died,"" Mykola said. Most of them were elderly people. It's unclear what they died of, but Mykola believes some suffocated to death. When people died, the bodies couldn't immediately be removed. Russian soldiers would not allow it every day. And because of the constant fighting outside - mortar shelling, explosions and gunfire - it was dangerous as well. This meant that people, including children, lived amidst corpses for hours, and sometimes days, until they could be taken outside. ""It was very scary. I knew the people who died,"" says Anastasiia. ""They treated us very kindly. I felt so sad, they just died here for no reason."" ""In normal conditions, they would not have died. Putin is a war criminal,"" said Mykola. ""My feet had begun to swell up. But I kept thinking to myself, I have to survive. I have to, for my daughter and two granddaughters."" Most of the time people were not allowed to go out even to use a toilet. They were made to use buckets instead. ""Sometimes the soldiers took people out to use them as shields,"" Mykola said. They were allowed to cook on open fires outside twice a day. The village had enough food stocks and a well for water. One of the Russian soldiers told Mykola they had been told they would be in Ukraine for just four days, which would be enough to take over Kyiv. On 3 April, the Russians withdrew from Yahidne. Ukrainian soldiers are now in the village, and most of those who were trapped have been evacuated to areas nearby. ""I wake up many times every night. I feel like I can hear the sound of shooting. I run to my parents, scared,"" says Anastasiia. The Russians occupied villages like Yahidne around Chernihiv in a bid to lay siege to the city and eventually take control of it. They weren't able to enter the city, but there's been extensive destruction to many parts of it and officials say around 350 civilians have been killed. Since Russia's withdrawal from around Chernihiv, volunteers have been burying the dead. One part of the local graveyard is now entirely full of fresh graves, with a placard stuck in each, for the purpose of identification. Families who have been separated have been coming to see if they can find the grave of their loved ones. A local football stadium was bombed, Ukrainian officials say by Russian aircraft. A giant crater can be seen in the centre of the field where one bomb fell. Another destroyed a part of the stands, now a mangled mess of broken plastic seats and metal railings. Next to the stadium, a children's library housed in a historic building has also been badly damaged. As we drove through the city, we passed several residential neighbourhoods which have been almost flattened. At Novoselivka, in the north of Chernihiv, destruction is visible as far as the eye can see. Piles of stones and bricks lie where homes must have stood. We saw a child's pink winter jacket, a teddy bear, a stuffed elephant and pieces of Lego on one of the paths going into the residential area. Along the way, we saw more bomb craters. A woman and child on bicycles gestured to us to follow them. Sixty-two-year-old Nina Vynnyk and her grandson, 10-year-old Danylo, wanted to show us their home - only a shell now, everything in and around it has been destroyed. Nina's daughter and Danylo's mother, 39-year-old Ludmyla, has lost her leg and is in hospital. When Nina's home began to be shelled, they ran to another person's house hoping to seek shelter in their basement. But that was bombed too. ""We were knocked out by the explosion. Someone got a concussion, someone was injured. When we came to our senses, I saw that my daughter was screaming, 'Mummy, mummy I don't have a leg'. It was horrible,"" she said. Ludmyla crawled to safety and was taken to a hospital. ""I feel like this is a terrible nightmare. It can't be true. Why didn't our government warn us? Why didn't they evacuate us,"" said Nina. Four generations of her family lived in the home. ""In one moment, there is nothing left. I don't know where I will live in the winter,"" she said. She can't afford to pay for prosthetics for her daughter. On Russian statements that they have not targeted civilians, she says, ""He [Putin] is full of lies. There is a woman in a hospital without a leg. That is the truth. ""Let Putin pay for her surgery. Let Putin build this house. He wanted it so much, didn't he? Let him pay for all of it now.""

It comes as Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the UK would send another £30m to Poland to help ensure vital supplies reach those fleeing Ukraine. Meeting with his Polish counterpart in Downing Street earlier, he said it was an important moment to launch a ""proper thoroughgoing security defence partnership"". Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg also said allies were ""ready to do more"" to provide military equipment but did not go into specifics. Ukraine Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba, also speaking at the Nato meeting, said help was needed in ""days not weeks"" if it was to avoid coming too late. Meanwhile, Russia has warned that ""pumping weapons into Ukraine"" will have a ""negative effect"" on peace talks. Ukraine is not a part of Nato but has been receiving military aid from its members. More than 30 countries, including the UK, have provided military aid, including €1bn (£800m) from the EU and $1.7bn (£1.3bn) from the US. So far Western supplies have been limited to arms, ammunition and defensive equipment, such as anti-tank and anti-aircraft missile systems. Nato members fear that supplying Ukraine with heavier offensive equipment such as tanks and fighter jets could lead to direct open conflict between Russia and the alliance. "

Der Spiegel magazine says some of the radio traffic tracked by the BND intelligence agency appears to match locations of bodies just outside Kyiv. The BND has so far made no public comments on the issue. Ukraine says more than 300 civilians were killed by the Russians in Bucha - Moscow denies any involvement. Recent images of Bucha streets strewn with bodies have shocked the international community. Some of the victims appeared to have been shot in the back of the head after their hands were tied. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has accused Russia of genocide, an accusation flatly rejected by Moscow. Warning: This piece contains graphic images which some may find upsetting. Bucha was seized by Russian troops soon after President Vladimir Putin ordered an invasion of Ukraine on 24 February. After more than a month, the Russians eventually withdrew from Bucha, and Ukrainian forces soon entered the town. The BND's intelligence was shared with German parliamentarians during a briefing on Wednesday, Der Spiegel reported on Thursday. In one intercepted radio message, the magazine said, Russian soldiers appeared to be talking about interrogating people and then shooting them. In another, a soldier talked about shooting someone on a bike, which appeared to match a notorious photo showing a dead cyclist in Bucha. According to Spiegel, the intercepts also appeared to indicate that mercenaries from Russia's private Wagner group played a key role in the Bucha killings. An unnamed security source told Reuters news agency: ""It's true that the [German] federal government has indications of Russian perpetration in Bucha"". ""However, these findings on Bucha refer to satellite images. The radio transmissions cannot be clearly assigned to Bucha."" Russia says its forces withdrew from Bucha on 30 March. The Ukrainians say this happened in the early hours of 31 March. On 1 April, footage was posted filmed from a car driving through the town which showed bodies on either side of a road. Russia has claimed, without providing evidence, that the footage shows ""fake dead bodies"" and it was ""staged"" after its troops had left the town. However, a satellite image from 19 March, first reported by the New York Times and confirmed by the BBC, directly contradicted the Russian claim. The photo by the Maxar technology company shows objects that appear to be bodies in the exact locations where they were subsequently found by Ukrainian forces when they regained control of the town north of Kyiv.

797,https://www.bbc.com/news/61025388,2022-04-07T16:07:52,Video appears to show killing of captive Russian soldier," A video has emerged which purports to show Ukrainian forces shooting and killing a captive Russian soldier. It was filmed on a road to the west of the Ukrainian capital Kyiv, where Russian forces have been retreating. Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said on Thursday that he was aware of the video and it would ""definitely be investigated"". The BBC has been analysing the footage - here is what we have found out so far. Warning: Graphic image and details that some may find upsetting. The video shows four people in military fatigues on the ground and one of those has their arms tied behind their back. Three are not moving but one appears still to be alive and wheezing although badly injured. A man out of shot says ""[expletive] leave him"" and another responds ""I don't want to [expletive] leave him"". A soldier (whose face cannot be seen on the video) then shoots him several times until he stops moving. The video then pans round to show other soldiers reacting. All of the bodies on the floor are wearing military uniform and there are pools of blood. You can only see the face of one of these people - the other three are face down on the road. We have located the incident to the main road outside the town of Dmytrivka to the west of Kyiv. The road links Dmytrivka to Irpin and Bucha. Scenes shown in the video match the scenery on Google Street View of the area. In a satellite image taken of the same road on 31 March, you can see what appears to be blood stains on the ground and armoured vehicles which are in the video. We can't be sure what day the video was filmed, although we do know it was taken in the afternoon due to the position of the shadows on the road. The first version we found of the video was posted on the morning of 30 March - meaning it was filmed in the afternoon of 29 March or earlier. The main clue comes from what is said during the video. One of the soldiers standing over the bodies on the floor says: ""Here they are, the defenders of the Russian army."" On top of this, the video also features unaccompanied armoured vehicles with a V painted on the side - typically a sign Russian troops mark their vehicles with. Two of the people on the floor are wearing white armbands, which have been used as identification by Russian soldiers in some parts of Ukraine. Red and orange armbands have also been used. There have also been reports that civilians have been encouraged to wear white armbands in some areas. On the military fatigues of some of the soldiers we can see blue armbands and Ukrainian flag patches, which are typical identifiers for Ukrainian forces. Clearly that is not proof of their identity. From what we can hear in the videos the soldiers are all speaking Russian, which is widely spoken in Ukraine. About half way through the video we can see one of the soldiers faces - a bearded man - very clearly. A couple of other soldiers' faces are clearly visible at points in the video. We have tried to biometrically match this face - a process where a computer algorithm compares an image to a huge number of photos of people's faces. The match is to a Georgian man with close links to Ukraine, but we are not naming him as we have not confirmed his identity. As the camera pans towards the man with the beard, another person shouts ""Glory to Ukraine"", to which the man with a beard responds ""Glory to heroes"". The first person then shouts in an excited way - although the audio is not clear - what sounds like the word ""Gruziny"" which means Georgians in Russian. The audio ends with a man saying: ""Do not [expletive] come to our land."" We have approached the Ukrainian Ministry of Defence for comment. We are still trying to verify elements of this video and will update this piece when we have more information.

Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba told a Nato meeting that more atrocities against civilians could happen if Ukraine doesn't get more military aid. Nato chief Jens Stoltenberg said members of the alliance had agreed more support for Ukraine. Russia has warned that ""pumping weapons into Ukraine"" will have a ""negative effect"" on peace talks. Mr Kuleba said he was looking for ""weapons, weapons and weapons"", but he added that Ukraine was offering Nato a ""fair deal"". ""You provide us with everything that we need, and we will fight for our security but also for your security, so that President Putin will have no chance to test Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty,"" he said. Article 5 is the key part of the Nato treaty that says that an attack on one Nato country is considered an attack on all. ""Either you help us now - and I'm speaking about days, not weeks, or your help will come too late, and many people will die, many civilians will lose their homes, many villages will be destroyed,"" Mr Kuleba said. Ukraine is not a part of Nato but has been receiving military aid from its members. Mr Stoltenberg said members of the alliance were prepared to increase support. ""After the invasion, allies stepped up with additional military support, with more military equipment, and it was a clear message from the meeting today that allies should do more and are ready to do more to provide more equipment, and they realise and recognise the urgency,"" he said. ""We are closely coordinating and discussing these issues with Ukraine, so allies are providing and are willing to do more when it comes to military support."" Over 30 countries including the UK have provided military aid to Ukraine, including €1bn (£800m) from the EU and $1.7bn (£1.3bn) from the US. So far Western supplies have been limited to arms, ammunition, and defensive equipment like anti-tank and anti-aircraft missile systems. Nato members fear that supplying Ukraine with heavier offensive equipment like tanks and fighter jets could lead to direct open conflict between Russia and the alliance. Russia warned on Thursday that the supply of weapons to Ukraine is harming any prospect of ending the war. ""Pumping weapons into Ukraine will not contribute to the success of Russian-Ukrainian talks,"" Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said, referring to the peace negotiations between the two countries. Speaking at Nato's headquarters ahead of Thursday's meeting, UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said ""in the face of Putin's appalling aggression...we are stepping up our supply of weapons to Ukraine."" Ms Truss is yet to detail what those supplies will include, but the Times newspaper has reported that the UK is preparing to supply Kyiv with armoured vehicles. It comes after reports this week that the Czech Republic is sending Soviet-era tanks to help Ukrainian forces, which if confirmed would make it the first Nato country to do so.

Students from Rossall School in Fleetwood, Lancashire have been preparing the property for a mother and her two sons who have fled the Russian invasion. Yuliia, 33, and her sons Oleg, eight, and three-year-old Volodymor, left the city of Kharkiv. Headmaster Jeremy Quatermain said they felt ""fortunate to be able to help"". ""We're a school and the one thing we can do is provide a safe environment for children to learn,"" he added. He said that there had been ""a huge desire to do something on the part of our community [but] it took a while to decide what to do"". Students and staff took part in fundraisers, including bike rides, but chose to take things ""one step further by sponsoring a family"". Mr Quatermain said: ""We had an empty house on site and DIY SOS-style we thought we'd do it up."" Students have helped refurbish the property and build furniture for the family. The school was matched to the family two weeks ago after the head teacher registered for the UK government's Homes for Ukraine scheme. The boys' father has remained in Ukraine, where most men aged 18-60 are prevented from leaving as they must join the resistance. ""We're under no illusions that this is an incredibly difficult and sad time in their lives so we want them to feel the kindness and compassion of the local community,"" Mr Quatermain said. The head teacher said his staff had also seen ""first-hand"" anxiety among Ukrainian students who were already at the school before the war began. He said the school hoped to take on six more students from Ukraine during the summer. Why not follow BBC North West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram?

Inna Shevchenko and her 27-year-old daughter, Karolina, are now staying at a friend's house in Northern Ireland. Ms Shevchenko was receiving hospital treatment in Germany when she heard news of the Russian invasion. She said she was very grateful her friends in Derry reached out and offered them a place to stay. ""At the beginning of January I came to Germany to be operated on with my brain tumour, it was cancer,"" she told BBC Radio Foyle. ""After this I found out that in my country the war had started. ""When my treatment finished, me and my daughter found ourselves in Germany and we couldn't come back to Ukraine because the situation is awful. ""We decided to go to Northern Ireland, to Derry, because our friends invited us to stay with them in their house,"" Ms Shevchenko said. ""My daughter Karolina and I are glad we are here among friends,"" she explained. ""I feel very nice, because first of all very many positive and kind people are around us. ""I feel like we are at home."" More than 6,000 people in Northern Ireland have already expressed an interest in offering accommodation to Ukrainian refugees. The Ukraine Sponsorship Scheme allows Ukrainian nationals and their family members to come to the UK if they have a named sponsor under the Homes for Ukraine Scheme. Ms Shevchenko said by relocating to Northern Ireland she is now also hoping to continue her treatment. ""People cannot have treatment in Ukraine, all the hospitals are destroyed or are closed, it is a catastrophe,"" she said. Ms Shevchenko said she receives online updates from people who are back in Kharkiv. ""We get messages from our friends, the situation is not good in Ukraine, they bomb the city every day and night, there are Russian troops everywhere, our relatives are in danger,"" she added. Ms Shevchenko said that she is worried for the safety of her elderly father, who has remained in the Ukrainian city. ""Our friends come to him every day. We are in touch with him through the internet every day when he has light, because sometimes in houses there is no light, no gas, no heating, it is very difficult to survive."" Ms Shevchenko said that herself and her daughter were very fortunate in how quickly they were able to enter Northern Ireland under the scheme. ""It wasn't very difficult as we got special letters from the UK government to say we are allowed,"" she explained. ""It was very easy through the sponsorship programme, it took about two weeks,"" she added. According to the latest government data, 4,700 sponsorship visas have been granted to Ukrainian refugees in the UK, with 40 sponsors coming from Northern Ireland. New data is expect to be published on Friday morning and that figure is expected to be higher, a spokesperson for the UK Home Office has said. "
803,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-61020565,2022-04-07T12:03:20,Ukraine War: 'Russian soldiers held us as human shields'," Clear evidence of Russian troops rounding up Ukrainian civilians and using them as human shields has been found by the BBC. In multiple interviews in Obukhovychi, villagers say they were taken from their homes at gunpoint and held in a school by Russians trying to stop advancing Ukrainian forces. Local people also gave accounts of Russian troops shooting civilians and holding others captive in and around Ivankiv, the neighbouring town. On the night of 14 March, Russian soldiers in Obukhovychi were under attack and losing men and armoured vehicles. The Ukrainians were regaining territory. As darkness fell, local people, sheltering in their cellars, heard explosions and the grinding sound of armoured vehicles manoeuvring. They had been under Russian occupation since the start of the invasion - the area was on the main axis of Russian advance. Obukhovychi is 100km (60 miles) from Kyiv, close to Belarus and just south of the exclusion zone around the site of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster. We have now managed to speak to many people about what happened that night. They all told us the same stories about 24 hours that traumatised the village. Families described how the Russians went door-to-door, rounded them up at gunpoint, and marched them to the local school - where the Russian forces used them as protection. Many of the houses in the village had the Ukrainian word for ""people"" painted on their gates - a way of warning soldiers to be careful and not hurt them. But, in the end, the signs were a magnet to Russian troops. We were told that if people didn't open their doors, the Russians broke them down. About 150 civilians, including the elderly and small children, were taken from their cellars to the school. ""The [Russians] are fascists, vandals. It was chaos, children and people crying… I don't want to talk about the Russians. They're not human beings,"" 60-year-old Ivan told us. Lydmila Sutkova described the terror of being rounded up at the school. ""When explosions came, we thought if the ceiling falls this will become a mass grave."" Others told us that some of the Russian soldiers were drunk, and threatened to take them to Belarus. Maria Bilohovost, an 89-year-old great grandmother, told us she had survived World War Two and that the Russian invaders were like the Germans. ""Except they spoke Russian, so I knew what they were saying."" She said the Russians left her in the house but took the rest of her family - including her granddaughter Maryana and great-granddaughter Marharyta. Maryana says two-year-old Marharyta still shows signs of anxiety. Maryana's mother Olena tells us that she was afraid they would all be shot in the gym. ""I was scared for my daughter. I don't have the words. I'm still frightened. Machine guns - a two-year-old girl should not see this."" Olena says that while the Russians were occupying the village, young women and girls hid inside their homes. ""We were really terrified. One lady went to collect wood for the fire in her house - she was shot in the leg. They just did it for fun."" In Obukhovychi, there was no mass slaughter of civilians - but we were told stories of individuals, including a local priest, being killed. Up the road, the nearby village of Termakhivka is built around a desolate crossroads, where routes lead to Belarus, Chernobyl, Warsaw and Kyiv. There were burnt out military vehicles and military emplacements - once held by the Russians, we were told, but now manned by Ukrainians. One local man, 25-year-old Bogdan, says he was held captive for 15 days outside in sub-zero temperatures - often bound and gagged - by Russian troops. He rolled up his trouser leg to show where a Russian had shot him. ""He put me on a bench near the house, aimed his machine gun at me and shot my knee… the reason is that I have a younger brother. He served in the army. They found his military cap and his military photos."" Bogdan also took us across a waterlogged field to show us a patch of disturbed ground - which he said was a shallow grave. The Russians forced him to dig the hole, he explains, so they could bury the body of a man who had been shot. Getting to these villages was a hard slog. It meant going the long way round, across pontoon bridges and along back roads through miles of deep forest. This part of Ukraine is a land of rivers and swamps. It's one reason why the Russian advance stopped. Now the Russians have pulled out of this area, it is slowly being reconnected to the rest of the country. While we were there, the Ukrainian army fixed a temporary bridge over a river on the road to the capital, next to the ruins of one the Russians blew up as they were retreating to Belarus. Dozens of volunteers were helping out, lighting fires, making soup, cutting trees, digging up stumps and smoothing out new roadways In areas where Ukrainian forces are in control, evidence is accumulating that Russian troops repeatedly broke the laws of war. The question is how the Russians are treating civilians in the places which they still occupy. "

The firm has pledged to no longer buy oil, but contracts signed before the invasion of Ukraine will be fulfilled. The costs of Shell no longer doing business in Russia include quitting joint ventures with Gazprom. Shell was criticised when it bought Russian crude oil at a cheap price shortly after the war began. In response to the outrage, the company apologised and pledged to stop buying oil from Russia. The company said it would cost between $4bn and $5bn to cut ties with the country. ""Shell has not renewed longer-term contracts for Russian oil, and will only do so under explicit government direction, but we are legally obliged to take delivery of crude bought under contracts that were signed before the invasion,"" the company said. The oil firm added that the state of the global oil markets remained ""volatile"". Brent Crude - the global benchmark for oil prices - was trading at about $100 a barrel early on Thursday, but its price has risen to record levels since the war in the Ukraine. The rise in oil prices is due to Russia being one of the world's largest exporters of the commodity and fears of supplies being disrupted because of the conflict. Though the UK gets very little of its oil from Russia, it has been affected by the global rise in prices, which has seen petrol and diesel prices hit record levels. As part of Shell's withdrawal plans, the company said previously it would offload a 27.5% stake in a Russian liquefied natural gas facility, a 50% stake in an oilfield project in Siberia and an energy joint venture. It will also end its involvement in the Nord Stream 2 pipeline between Russia and Germany, which has been put on hold by ministers in Berlin. "

When the war in Ukraine started, Anton Mandziuk drove from his home in Rutland to the Polish border to collect his cousin and her family. He then applied for them to live with him, but after weeks of waiting they have decided to go to Ireland instead. A government spokesperson said they were moving as quickly as possible and had already issued almost 30,000 visas. Lesha Voloshyn, her three daughters and six grandchildren fled their home in Ivano-Frankivsk on 5 March. They made their way to the Polish border where Mr Mandziuk picked them up. Mr Mandziuk - whose father was from Ukraine - then applied for their visas to come to the UK. He said it was a ""difficult and tiring"" process and at one point, his family even considered giving up and going back to Ukraine. ""It's been a really, really difficult journey. ""I've been filling in these ginormous application forms, which are still to be processed,"" he said. His relatives had permission to stay anywhere in the European Union and spent the first few weeks in the Netherlands and Belgium. With their UK application taking so long to be processed, they decided to go to Ireland because English is the first language there. He said they had been warmly welcomed and were staying at a hotel with other Ukrainian families. Mr Mandziuk said his family now planned to stay in Ireland after what has already been an arduous journey - a decision he found ""really disappointing"". ""I'd love them to be able to come to England, where I've got a big family to support them while they're here, but equally I've got to respect their decision. ""They've been desperate to get the children into school, they've been on the road for some four weeks,"" he said. A government spokesperson said they had issued almost 30,000 visas in the past three weeks and were expecting to issue thousands more. ""We are moving as quickly as possible to ensure that those fleeing Ukraine can find safety in the UK. ""We have streamlined the process so valid passport holders do not have to attend in-person appointments before arriving in the UK, simplified our forms and boosted caseworker numbers, while ensuring vital security checks are carried out,"" the spokesperson added.

Helen Goodman, who was Labour MP for Bishop Auckland from 2005 to 2019, said the Homes for Ukraine scheme needed to be made ""much easier"". She will host a mother and two children to ""give them some stability"". The government said ""progress approving visas had not been good enough"" but ""greater resource had gone in"". Ms Goodman said other European countries are giving Ukrainians sanctuary without the need for a visa but the British government had ""decided everybody must go through the process of applying"" for one. She told BBC Radio Tees her side of things involved signing up to the government's register which was ""really straightforward and easy"". But refugees have to fill in visa application forms online detailing every person seeking sanctuary and immediate relations staying in Ukraine. ""The reason this is a problem for people in Ukraine is they have just escaped, they haven't got anything on them,"" Ms Goodman said, adding: ""Uploading documents like a photograph of your passport on a mobile phone when you're in a place with dodgy internet connection, this is not a good system. ""They have to upload details of each person coming and details of the sponsor. The [government] should say 'OK this is a mum with two kids, we will have one form for that family'.

810,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-61018275,2022-04-07T05:01:02,Ukraine war: Kyiv's successes do not mean imminent victory," The course of the war in Ukraine has taken many by surprise, not least the Russian leadership. But as our world affairs editor John Simpson reports from the western city of Lviv, Ukraine's politicians are cautioning against too much optimism. Some commentators in the West seem to think the Ukrainian war is pretty much won. One American military historian says he knows of no parallel to a major power like Russia invading a country at the time of its choosing and failing so utterly. Here in Ukraine, though, people aren't nearly so confident. They think they're in for a long slog, which will end either with a clear defeat for Russia, or - alternatively - when President Vladimir Putin feels he has gained enough Ukrainian territory to be able to claim victory. Precisely because they believe they are in for a long and difficult war, Ukrainian politicians from President Volodymyr Zelensky down are getting angry with what Ukraine sees as Nato's pathetically slow delivery of weapons supplies. The governor of Lviv Maksym Kozytsky, a close ally of the president, says, ""In my opinion, from the West there is a policy of double standards and cowardice. It's cowardice not to call a spade a spade. And cowardice not to take any position. And cowardice leads to tragedies."" There is a persistent feeling here that Nato is dragging its feet. Ukrainians think the West is worried that if it provides too many high-quality weapons, President Putin will use this as a pretext to attack Nato territory - and a much wider and far deadlier war could break out. Western officials here say this isn't true, and they're puzzled by it. The US chargé d'affaires to Ukraine, Kristina Kvien - currently based in Poland - insists that the US and its allies are pumping weaponry into Ukraine as fast as they can. But she accepts that the Kyiv government will always want more and quicker arms deliveries. Tanks are now starting to arrive from the Czech Republic - though one lesson of this war so far has been that tanks are horribly vulnerable to drones and shoulder-held missiles. The US is considering providing anti-ship weapons to counter the bombardment of towns and cities along the coast from Odesa eastwards. Ukraine's Defence Minister Oleksii Reznikov is calling for heavy weapons to counter the Russian forces switching from the Kyiv front to Donbas in the east. This new stage in the fighting will be a lot more challenging for the Ukrainians, whose supply lines will be longer than they were around the capital. Privately, senior politicians here are worried Ukraine will lose further territory to Russia. And, like the Nato Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg, they think this war could go on for a long time. In the meantime the world will presumably see more and more of the terrible destruction which Russian troops have visited on towns and villages around Kyiv. Experienced correspondents like the BBC's Jeremy Bowen say the devastation in the small town of Borodyanka is worse for its size than Irpin and Bucha. The expectation is that many more cases of torture and murder will come to light in the days to come. The evidence of war crimes has made Ukraine even more determined to fight back against the invaders. It is also helping to stiffen the resolve of Nato countries whose populations are overwhelmingly against the Russian invasion. Ukrainian politicians like Mr Zelensky and his colleagues have probably realised that by accusing the West of dragging its feet, they'll encourage people to demand that their governments should do even more to help Ukraine. Meanwhile the sanctions which are already being imposed are estimated to set the Russian economy back 15 years. And there are certainly plenty more sanctions to come. ""This has been a textbook example of how not to fight a war,"" says one well-known British military analyst. That is surely true. On 26 February, only two days after the invasion began, the Russian state-owned news agency Ria Novosti put out a story celebrating the successful return of Ukraine to the Russian motherland. The article was hurriedly withdrawn, since even by then the war was obviously not going well. The other day, Dmitry Medvedev, who kept the presidential seat warm for Vladimir Putin for a four-year term between 2008 and 2012, announced that Russia was building a power base that would spread from Vladivostok in the Russian far east to Portugal in the west. Still, just because that kind of boasting sounds ludicrously wide of the mark after six weeks of war, it doesn't mean that Ukraine is starting to plan any victory parades. We could have a long way to go yet. John Simpson's programme, Unspun World, is broadcast on BBC2 on Wednesdays, the BBC News channel on Saturdays, and BBC World News on Sundays. "
811,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-61018959,2022-04-07T04:22:08,Ukraine War: Veterans prepare for battle in occupied Luhansk," The sound of Russian artillery grew louder as we drove to a Ukrainian frontline position in Luhansk. The rumble of shelling interspersed with the occasional burst of small arms fire. We were within 500 metres of the Russian positions. This may be a conflict in the 21st century but, at times, with its maze of trenches, it feels more like something from the First World War. Russia's military offensive in eastern Ukraine is already intensifying. You can see it in the long queues of traffic driving west towards relative safety; you can feel it in the deserted streets as you drive through the towns and cities of the Donbas; and you can hear it with the increasing sound of Russian artillery. Russia is redeploying more of its forces from northern to eastern Ukraine. The objective is to step up the battle in the Luhansk and Donetsk - parts of which were already controlled by Russian backed separatists. Russia will take advantage of its shorter supply lines - something which proved a problem in its failed offensive on the capital Kyiv. Russia and its proxies now control around 90% of Luhansk and more than half of Donetsk - the old industrial heartlands of Ukraine. There is smoke rising across a landscape already scarred by mining and factories. Ukrainian forces have been fighting a war here for the past eight years. Their units include some of the country's most battle hardened troops. Western officials say Ukrainian forces stationed in the Donbas are the best trained and equipped units. As the Russian offensive pushes from the north, east and south there is a real danger they may soon be encircled and cut off. Ukraine has already lost ground to Russia. But they are digging in for the fight. As we travelled east towards the frontline we saw new defensive positions and trenches being dug. Anatoly, a 52-year-old soldier, peered through a periscope from his trench to view the Russian positions. He told me ""I see the Russians, they look like me"". But he was ready to hold the line. He said ""if they try to take our position, I will kill them. If I don't kill them, they will kill me. It's the rules of war."" Most of the men we talked to believed that their well-prepared trenches and defences will give them the upper hand against the invaders. Andrej, a 27-year-old soldier, was kept company in his gloomy dug out by his pet dog Lucifer. He told me ""we have good weapons and good fortifications and if Russia attacks us here they will lose"". The troops say they've been supplied with western weapons such as javelin anti-tank missiles. They were grateful, but were hoping for more. Andrej said that President Putin is a ""psycho"" but he added that his dead Russian soldiers would be good fertiliser for the soil. The troops looked weary from the fighting, but all said morale was high. Roman, a deputy commander, had spent four years studying psychology at Lviv University. As well as fighting he was able to offer his men mental health support. But he said ""usually people don't need my help. They have a good motivation for fighting for their family, friends and home, unlike the Russians"", who he dismissively described as ""zombies"". The Ukrainian troops are all well aware that Russia is redeploying more forces to the east. They know that worse is to come. But Roman believes that Ukraine's forces are more tactically astute. He said that Russia's military doctrine had not progressed since World War Two, relying on artillery. That Russian artillery though is already forcing tens of thousands of people to leave their homes. "
812,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-61008293,2022-04-06T23:46:50,Ukraine war: Russians fed twisted picture and one voice - that of Putin," The Kremlin denies it all: the footage of bodies lying in the streets in Bucha, the mass graves and the terrible testimony of witnesses. And state TV parrots the narrative. Since evidence of apparent Russian atrocities emerged from the settlements around Kyiv, programme editors have gone to extraordinary lengths to discredit the reports as a fabrication, a lie concocted by Ukraine and the West. To switch on Russian TV has, for weeks now, been to step into a weird parallel universe where glossy presenters and well-dressed pundits chronicle a successful ""special military operation"" in Ukraine. There is no war, just heroic Russian soldiers defending the motherland while taking care to avoid targeting civilians. The horrific images from Bucha have been broadcast, but viewers are told that the gruesome scenes were staged by Ukrainian officials, with help from the West. ""This was done by professionals, probably British. They're the best in the area of information operations,"" said commentator Gevorg Mirzaryan. ""[They know how] to place the bodies correctly, do everything correctly, create a nice picture for the necrophilic Western consciousness."" Talk show host Olesya Loseva even suggested that the town of Bucha had deliberately been chosen because President Joe Biden had recently used the word butcher to describe Vladimir Putin, so ""for Americans this word should be clear"". It is a classic Kremlin tactic in the face of such accusations - deny, dismiss as fake and, if possible, blame someone else. Some outlets, including pro-Kremlin tabloid Komsomolskaya Pravda, have published reports accusing Ukrainian troops or militants of being behind the killing of civilians in Bucha. The newspaper also alleged that ""Kyiv propagandists"" were controlled by ""Western curators"". The UK was taking charge of fake news about Russian soldiers raping Ukrainian women and the BBC, Guardian and Independent had helped to promote it, it claimed. This approach has also been taken up by former President Dmitry Medvedev, who is now deputy chairman of Russia's Security Council. He has gone so far as to accuse Ukraine's armed forces of killing their own civilians ""in order to dehumanise Russia and its maximum denigration"". Vladimir Putin and his officials have consistently sought to portray Russia's neighbour as the aggressor and the West as a threat to Russian security. They have accused Ukraine, aided by the West, of trying to acquire nuclear weapons and develop biological weapons for use against Russia. One of Vladimir Putin's favourite justifications for the invasion is that Ukraine must be ""de-Nazified"". It's a commonly repeated narrative that exploits Russia's long and painful memory of World War Two. The claims of Nazism are completely baseless, but the foreign ministry recently accused the government in Kyiv of being steeped in Nazi ideology and of committing ""horrendous crimes"". Many Ukrainians, including President Volodymyr Zelensky, have been horrified by an opinion piece published by Russia's state-owned Ria news agency which they say justifies genocide in Ukraine. The piece by Timofei Sergeytsev claimed that a significant number of Ukrainians were ""passive Nazis"" who supported and indulged the ""Nazi authorities"". Ukraine was unviable as a national state and attempts to build one would logically lead to Nazism, he claimed. ""De-Nazification will inevitably be a de-Ukrainisation as well,"" he added. Mr Medvedev appeared to take up the theme by claiming ""the goal is for the harmony of future generations of Ukrainians and the opportunity to build an open Eurasia from Lisbon to Vladivostok"". For Russian media, the atrocity in Bucha is just a new example of Ukrainian aggression - an ""information war"". Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has described what he termed Ukraine's fabrication of Russian war crimes as a ""provocation"" that threatens international security. It's hard to say how many Russians believe all that they're told. But there is no significant independent Russian media left and access to social media is severely restricted. Opinion polls, even independent ones, are a tricky source in Russia because people are wary of expressing anti-Kremlin sentiment. As such, they suggest high levels of support for Vladimir Putin and his ""special military operation"". What were almost daily anti-war street demonstrations have dwindled. There are, without doubt, plenty of people who manage to access external and independent news reports and who are horrified and deeply ashamed by what is being perpetrated in the name of their country. But they're up against a powerful Kremlin propaganda machine and a state that swiftly crushes dissent. In this Russia, there is only really one voice. And it belongs to Vladimir Putin. "

Galvanised by the images of corpses littering the streets of areas the Russians had withdrawn from, and stories of rape and murder from survivors, the US announced a new round of measures against Russian officials and their families and two major banks. A US official told journalists that Mr Putin and his inner circle were believed to hide their wealth with family members who would then place it in the Western financial system. US President Joe Biden called the killings ""major war crimes"". Forced to address the issue, Mr Putin on Wednesday called the killings in the town of Bucha a ""crude and cynical provocation by the Kyiv regime"" - even though satellite images have shown the civilians were killed when Russians were in control of Bucha. The US said that Mr Putin's daughters, Katerina Vladimirovna Tikhonova and Maria Vladimirovna Vorontsova, were being put under sanctions ""for being the adult children of Putin, a person whose property and interests in property are blocked"". The two are the daughters of President Putin and his ex-wife Lyudmila. The pair married in 1983 when she was a flight attendant and he a KGB officer. Their marriage lasted 30 years, spanning Mr Putin's rapid rise to the top of Russia's political system. The US announcement described Ms Tikhonova as ""a tech executive whose work supports the GoR [Russian government] and defense industry"". Her sister, Ms Vorontsova, it went on, ""leads state-funded programs that have received billions of dollars from the Kremlin toward genetics research and are personally overseen by Putin"". Read more - Who are Putin's daughters? In Bucha itself, the BBC's Joel Gunter has been speaking to survivors, including Iryna Abramov whose husband Oleg was forced to kneel on the street and shot in the head at point blank range by Russian soldiers. When Iryna ran out and found his disfigured body, the four Russian soldiers who dragged him out were standing casually drinking water, she said. She screamed at them to shoot her, and one raised his gun, then lowered it, then raised it again, and lowered it, until her father dragged her back inside the gate. ""Those soldiers told us we had three minutes to leave and they forced us to run in our slippers,"" Iryna's father Volodymyr said.

""There are a lot of people left under the rubble,"" confirmed Maria, who was busy sorting mirrors and pictures that could be salvaged and throwing the rest into a skip behind her apartment block. ""My soul hurts. I knew all those people. We knew they were there from the first day, but they wouldn't let us get them out."" Maria and many others told us that Russian troops looted their property.

815,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-61011022,2022-04-06T20:00:14,Ukraine war: Bucha deaths 'not far short of genocide' - PM," Attacks on civilians by Russian forces in the Ukrainian town of Bucha do not ""look far short of genocide"", Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said. The UK has announced further sanctions against eight oligarchs and Russian banks, including the country's largest, Sberbank, and Credit Bank of Moscow. Dozens of people have been found dead in the town - including some in a mass grave - after Russia's withdrawal. Moscow denied involvement and described reports as fake news. The Foreign Office announced its latest sanctions following the reports of attacks on civilians, and these include ending all imports of Russian coal and oil by the end of the year as well as action against strategic industries. The latest sanctions come in step with those imposed by the US, which has also imposed sanctions on Russian President Vladimir Putin's two daughters. Ahead of the new sanctions being announced, Mr Johnson said: ""I'm afraid when you look at what's happening in Bucha, the revelations that we are seeing from what Putin has done in Ukraine doesn't look far short of genocide to me. ""It is no wonder people are responding in the way that they are. I have no doubt that the international community, Britain very much in the front rank, will be moving again in lockstep to impose more sanctions and more penalties on Vladimir Putin's regime."" As part of its sanctions response, the UK has pledged to stop importing Russian oil by the end of the year, while the EU is reducing its imports of Russian gas by two-thirds. Mr Johnson praised the ""enormous strides"" the EU is taken to reduce dependence on Russian gas. At a working dinner in Brussels on Wednesday evening Foreign Secretary Liz Truss is expected to tell Nato colleagues the ""age of engagement with Russia is over"". She is expected to say there is ""no time for false comfort"" and that Russia is not retreating but regrouping to push harder in the east of Ukraine. Ms Truss is expected to urge allies to arm Ukraine quickly and decisively, and to rethink its support for countries ""caught in the web of Russian influence"", such as Georgia and Moldova. As part of sanctions imposed on Russia all new outward investment to the country has been banned, while imports of Russian iron and steel products will be banned. Among those added to the sanctions list is Viatcheslav Kantor, the largest shareholder of fertilizer company Acron, whose donations funded a new unit at a London hospital used by the royal family. The Edward VII Hospital accepted a donation from the Kantor Charitable Foundation to fund the Kantor Medical Centre. The other oligarchs added to the sanctions list include: Ms Truss said the latest wave of sanctions would decimate Mr Putin's ""war machine"" and show the Russian elite could not wash their hands of the atrocities committed on his orders. Sanctions are penalties imposed by countries intended to stop aggression, or punish breaches of international law, and often involve financial curbs. Those taken by the UK so far include freezing assets, excluding Russian banks from the UK financial system, banning some exports to Russia, restricting visas for wealthy investors and banning flights. By the end of the year, the UK has said it will also phase out Russian oil imports. Along with the EU and US, it has frozen the assets of more than 1,000 individuals and companies, including politicians and wealthy business leaders thought to be close to the Kremlin. Asset freezes prevent anyone in the UK or any UK company from dealing with any funds or resources that are owned or held by the designated person, and prevent resources being provided to or for the benefit of that person. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer had called for ""even tougher sanctions"" following the ""horrific, harrowing images"" of civilian deaths in Bucha. He said we have to give Ukraine ""every support we can"" and said the international community must be clear ""that these war crimes will end up with those responsible being hunted down"". The deliberate targeting of civilians, as has been alleged by residents of Bucha, is a war crime under the Geneva Convention. But for a massacre to be considered genocide, the law also requires proof of the intent to destroy a particular national, ethnic, racial or religious group - whether entirely or in part. The Genocide Convention, introduced after the Nazi Holocaust during World War Two, requires the 152 nations who are signatories to ""prevent and to punish"" genocide where it occurs. "

Viatcheslav Kantor, whose name is still above the door of the central London hospital, faces sanctions over Ukraine. The hospital recently opened the Kantor Medical Centre, funded by Dr Kantor, and so far is keeping its name. The King Edward VII's is where the Queen has gone for medical care, including a night's stay last autumn. The hospital describes itself as an ""independent charitable hospital with a proud history of royal patronage, discreetly located within London's Harley Street medical district"". Prince Philip and other members of the Royal Family have also been treated there. Dr Kantor has been described by the UK government as the ""largest shareholder of fertilizer company Acron with vital strategic significance for the Russian government"". Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said: ""We are showing the Russian elite that they cannot wash their hands of the atrocities committed on Putin's orders."" Dr Kantor had been ""life governor"" of the hospital but has stepped down from this role and from the board of trustees. The oligarch's significant donations to the hospital have funded the Kantor Medical Centre, opened this year, which has seven floors of treatment and diagnostic services. It includes new facilities for MRI and CT scans, ultrasound, X-rays and consulting rooms and will have rooms for minor procedures. Dr Kantor, funder of the Kantor Charitable Foundation, has been a donor to many charities and arts projects in the UK. The foundation's online photo gallery shows him with Russian President Vladimir Putin, among other international figures. At the outbreak of the war in Ukraine the hospital had defended the acceptance of donations from the UK-registered charity funded by Dr Kantor. ""We share the deep concern felt by people across the world at the invasion of Ukraine,"" said a statement from the hospital. Those on the sanctions list are subject to asset freezes, meaning anyone in the UK or any UK company is prevented from dealing with any funds or property that is owned by them. Dr Kantor is among eight oligarchs who were added to the UK's sanctions list as part of its latest package of measures in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The others included fertiliser firm founder Andrey Guryev, truck manufacturing firm director Sergey Kogogin, diamond producer Sergey Sergeyevich Ivanov, natural gas firm boss Leonid Mikhelson, Gazprombank chief executive Andrey Akimov, oil producer Gazpromneft chief executive Aleksander Dyukov, and Boris Borisovich Rotenberg - the son of the co-owner of Russia's largest gas pipeline producer SGM. Other sanctions include asset freezes on Russia's largest bank, Sberbank, and Credit Bank of Moscow, as well as plans to end imports of Russian coal and oil by the end of the year. "

Dr Mateo Szmidt said the ambulance was hit on Monday while it was parked at a depot near a children's hospital in Mykolaiv, in the south of the country. Nobody is thought to have been hurt. The consultant from Prince Charles Hospital, Merthyr Tydfil, raised £26,000 to send aid to people following the Russian invasion. ""A lot of people contributed to the ambulance, to make everything happen,"" Dr Szmidt said. ""This is something that is aiding [Ukrainians] - for it to be targeted is very disheartening."" Nonetheless, he said, what happened was ""part of conflict"" and he and other medics at Prince Charles Hospital would not be deterred. ""We're just going to raise more money, get more aid,"" he said. Mykolaiv is located between the Black Sea port of Odesa and Kherson - a region Ukrainian forces are fighting to regain from Russian control. ""The shelling was confirmed to me by British Ukranian Aid and the mayor of Mykolaiv has also commented about it, Dr Szmidt added. The group of campaigners has acquired a third ambulance which it is hoping to send to Ukraine by the end of the week. The ambulances are filled with bandages, defibrillators and infusion pumps donated by health boards in south Wales. The group has been working closely with charity British Ukrainian Aid which has logistics in place in Ukraine. The first ambulance was driven to Ukraine by a one of the charity's staff members. ""It's a big logistics mission to get it out there with curfews, and they have to have some assistance from the Ukrainian military,"" said Dr Szmidt The group is still awaiting news of the extent of the damage caused to the shelled ambulance. It had been operating in the region for three weeks and Dr Szmidt hopes it can be salvaged. "

Lord Harrington insisted ""raised voices"" in meetings were the result of a desire shared by all ministers to ""do the same thing"" and help people. He also revealed that 29,000 visas had been issued to Ukrainians, with around 65,000 applications received so far. But Labour said the government had to ""step up to the plate"". Several newspapers have reported that Home Secretary Priti Patel and Foreign Secretary Liz Truss have argued over how to clear a backlog of Ukrainian refugees' applications, amid reports that only ""hundreds"" of people have so far made it to the UK. The BBC understands that HM Revenue and Customs and Department for Work and Pensions staff are now helping with the processing of Ukrainian refugees. A Home Office source said a ""cross-government effort"" was under way. Lord Harrington, making his maiden speech since becoming a minister, said during a Lords debate: ""I've not seen this feuding between departments that's reported."" He told peers he had attended meetings with Home Secretary Priti Patel and Housing and Communities Secretary Michael Gove, among others, adding: ""I've seen raised voices because we are all trying to do the same thing, but not [because we are angry] with each other... ""What happens behind closed doors, I couldn't possibly know... I've not experienced [feuding] myself."" Lord Harrington said the immediate vetting of refugees should, at most, include passport checks, verifying whether people are on criminal watch lists, checking whether children travelling with adults are actually theirs, and checking whether sponsors have criminal records - the last two designed to prevent people trafficking. ""That's really it,"" he added, saying that ""it's taken too long to do it"" so far. The government is operating two schemes to help Ukrainians displaced by Russia's invasion to come to the UK - involving living with family members already in the country or sponsorship by other hosts. For Labour, shadow Home Office minister Lord Coaker said: ""There's a bureaucratic mess here and a bureaucratic quagmire and it needs to be sorted out. ""The British people want better from their government... They want their government to step up to the plate."" The United Nations says 4.28 million people have fled Ukraine since Russia invaded in late February. Of these, neighbouring Poland has taken almost 2.5 million. "

The list also includes the family of Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and major banks. The measures follow new revelations of atrocities by Russian troops in Ukraine, including images of bodies of civilians scattered on the streets of Bucha, near the capital Kyiv. Russia says, without evidence, the images are staged by Kyiv officials. Even though satellite images have shown the civilians were killed when Russians were in control of Bucha, Mr Putin on Wednesday described the event as a ""crude and cynical provocation by the Kyiv regime"". Referring to the Bucha murders, US President Joe Biden said on Wednesday: ""There's nothing less happening than major war crimes."" ""Responsible nations have to come together to hold these perpetrators accountable,"" Mr Biden added.

Her sister, Ms Vorontsova, it went on, ""leads state-funded programs that have received billions of dollars from the Kremlin toward genetics research and are personally overseen by Putin"". Asked why the US was targeting Mr Putin's daughters, a senior Biden administration official said the US thought they could be in control of some of their father's assets. ""We have reason to believe that Putin, and many of his cronies, and the oligarchs, hide their wealth, hide their assets, with family members that place their assets and their wealth in the US financial system, and also many other parts of the world,"" the official said. ""We believe that many of Putin's assets are hidden with family members, and that's why we're targeting them."" The US sanctions announced by the White House include: Meanwhile the UK has announced further sanctions against eight oligarchs and Russian banks, including the country's largest, Sberbank, and Credit Bank of Moscow. The European Union is also debating cutting off Russian coal imports as concern over alleged war crimes increases. Before the new raft of sanctions was announced in Washington, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said he could not ""tolerate any indecisiveness"". Speaking to the Irish parliament on Wednesday, he said there was still a need to convince some in Europe who believe ""war and war crimes are not as horrific as financial losses"" to back tougher sanctions. He added that ""Russian oil cannot feed the Russian military machine"", with Ukraine's foreign minister arguing on Twitter that an embargo on gas and oil was needed to truly impact Russia's ability to finance the war. Josep Borrell, the EU's chief diplomat, separately acknowledged on Wednesday that the one billion euros ($1.09bn; £833m) Europe spent on Russian energy every day put into sharp perspective the billion euros given to Ukraine in military assistance since the start of the invasion. Some European member states, including Germany, are heavily reliant on Russian energy and had been reluctant to directly target the sector. However, in a first, the European Commission proposed a potential ban on imports of Russian coal on Tuesday, which must be agreed by all 27 members. Europe buys around €4bn ($4.4bn; £3.3bn) worth of coal from Moscow every year. Sentiment appeared to change after evidence of Russian war crimes emerged, with French President Emmanuel Macron joining calls for a ban on coal earlier this week. The ban was suggested ahead of a range of sanctions set to be announced in coordination with the US and other G7 nations. European member states are also expected to impose a ""full transaction ban"" on four Russian banks and ban a range of other Russian and Belarusian imports, including wood, cement, seafood and liquor, worth €5.5 billion ($6bn; £4.59bn). And Ursula von der Leyen, the European Commission president, said she intends to close EU ports to Russian vessels and ban Russian and Belarusian road transport operators from the region. Ms Von der Leyen accused Russia of ""waging a cruel and ruthless war"" against Ukrainian civilians and said the EU must ""sustain utmost pressure on Putin and the Russian government at this critical point"". But Lithuanian Foreign Minister Gabrielius Landsbergis on Tuesday evening criticized the EU's proposed sanctions package, calling it a ""feeble response"" which is ""an invitation for more atrocities."" ""Coal, four banks…a ban on ports and borders (with exceptions) is not really an adequate sanctions package to the massacres that are being uncovered,"" Mr Landsbergis wrote on Twitter. "

The 23-year-old was dismissed by his US-based team days before the EU included him and his oligarch father, Dmitry Mazepin, on a list of Russians sanctioned as a result of the invasion. Both are also sanctioned by the UK. The EU sanctions list describes Dmitry Mazepin, who has funded his son’s motorsports career, as “a member of the closest circle of Vladimir Putin”. It says Nikita Mazepin is a “person associated with a leading businessperson [his father] involved in economic sectors providing a substantial source of revenue to the government of the Russian Federation"". Speaking to Stephen Sackur from Moscow, the driver described the sanctions as “cancel culture against my country”. Mazepin said he did not agree with the sanctions, and would fight them, but now was probably not the right time.

What we know about his family," Russia's President, Vladimir Putin, has always been guarded when it comes to questions over his family. In 2015, during one of his marathon news conferences, he dodged questions about his daughter's identities. ""My daughters live in Russia and studied only in Russia, I am proud of them,"" he said. ""They speak three foreign languages fluently. I never discuss my family with anyone."" ""Every person has a right for their fate, they live their own life and do it with dignity,"" he added. He might not want to name them, but others have. The latest round of US sanctions has targeted Maria Vorontsova, 36, and Katerina Tikhonova, 35. ""We believe that many of Putin's assets are hidden with family members, and that's why we're targeting them,"" one US official said. While little has been officially confirmed about President Putin's family life, documents, media reports and the occasional public pronouncement are enough to provide a portrait of the pair. The two are the daughters of President Putin and his ex-wife Lyudmila. The pair married in 1983 when she was a flight attendant and he a KGB officer. Their marriage lasted 30 years, spanning Mr Putin's rapid rise to the top of Russia's political system. In 2013, they split. Mr Putin said ""it was a joint decision: we hardly see each other, each of us has our own life"". She said he was ""completely drowned in work"". Their eldest, Maria Vorontsova, was born in 1985. She studied biology at St Petersburg University and medicine at Moscow State University. Mrs Vorontsova is now an academic, specialising in the endocrine system. She co-wrote a book on stunted growth in children, and is listed as a researcher at the Endocrinology Research Centre in Moscow. She's also a businesswoman. BBC Russia identified her as co-owner of a company planning to build a massive medical centre. Mrs Vorontsova is married to Dutch businessman Jorrit Joost Faassen, who once worked at Russian state energy giant Gazprom, although they have reportedly separated. People who have spoken to her since the Ukraine invasion say she supports her father, and has cast doubt over international reporting of the conflict. Compared to her sister, Katerina Tikhonova has been much more in the public eye, not least due to her talents as a rock n' roll dancer. She and her partner came fifth at an international event in 2013. That same year, she married Kirill Shamalov, the son of a long-time friend of President Putin. Their wedding was held at an exclusive ski resort near St Petersburg. Workers there said the couple arrived on a sleigh drawn by three white horses. Mr Shamalov was sanctioned by the US in 2018 for his role in Russia's energy sector. The US Treasury said that ""his fortunes drastically improved following the marriage"". The pair have since split. Following the invasion of Ukraine, two Russian activists were arrested for occupying a luxury villa in Biarritz said to be owned by Mr Shamalov. Ms Tikhonova is now in academia and business. She made a brief appearance on Russian state media in 2018 to talk about neurotechnology and also at a business forum in 2021. In neither cases was her relationship to the president mentioned. Neither woman is said to spend a lot of time with President Putin. Mr Putin also has grandchildren. He mentioned them at a phone-in in 2017, but did not say how many he had or which of his daughters had them. ""Regarding my grandchildren, one is already in nursery school. Please understand, I don't want them to grow up like some kind of royal princes. I want them to grow up like normal people,"" he said. "

Iryna Vereshchuk said if they did not, Ukraine wouldn't ""be able to help"" as Russia's invading forces move in. Her warning comes as a picture begins to emerge of atrocities carried out in Ukrainian towns under the control of Moscow's troops - including allegations of rape, torture and executions. Russia's Vladimir Putin has again denied his forces are to blame. In a call with Hungary's re-elected prime minister - and Moscow ally - Viktor Orban on Wednesday, Mr Putin said the alleged atrocities seen in Bucha - the town where bodies of civilians were left out on the streets, and mass graves were discovered at the church - were a ""crude and cynical provocation"" created by the Ukrainian government. There is a growing body of evidence which contradicts Mr Putin's claims that the horrors in Bucha have been staged, including satellite images showing bodies discovered late last week were already lining the street on 19 March - when it was still under Russian control. As Russia withdraws from the north, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has warned that the worst atrocities committed may yet to be discovered. However, thoughts are now turning to the people in the east, where Russian forces are regrouping before a push to take the region known as the Donbas, the area that includes the Donetsk and Luhansk regions which have been controlled by Russia-backed rebels since 2014. Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said on Wednesday they were ""expecting a major offensive"". ""We have seen no indication that President Putin has changed his ambition to control the whole of Ukraine and also to rewrite the international order so we need to be prepared for a long haul,"" he added. Ms Vereshchuk said the leaders in Donetsk and Luhansk regions, as well as Kharkiv, slightly further north, were trying to organise an evacuation ahead of any attack. ""It has to be done now because later people will be under fire and face the threat of death,"" the deputy prime minister said on her Telegram channel. ""There is nothing they will be able to do about it, nor will we be able to help."" The difficulties of evacuating people from areas under sustained attack has been exemplified in Mariupol - the southern city which would link Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014, to Russia through the Donbas if it fell under Moscow's control. The International Committee of the Red Cross has been trying to reach Mariupol since last week so it can lead a convoy of evacuees to safety, but has failed every day. Residents leaving by themselves describe scenes of horror within the besieged city. ""There are starving people,"" a woman named Yulia told the BBC's Tom Bateman. ""People are being buried in the streets. Shallow graves, half a metre deep at best. [There are] dead bodies all over the streets."" Russia has made clear the Donbas is its next target, and people have been fleeing the region since last week. On Wednesday, the BBC's defence correspondent Jonathan Beale passed a 50-mile tailback of traffic as people moved west. Maryna Agafonova, 27, is among those who have already fled, leaving her parents behind in Lysychansk, in Luhansk, as the attacks intensified. ""They attacked hospitals and residential buildings. There is no heating and no electricity."" But Ukrainian forces were still holding out there in numbers, she told the BBC: ""They aren't letting the Russians occupy it."" "

Maria and her 17-year-old son Borys arrived in Rauceby, Lincolnshire, after fleeing the eastern city of Dnipro. Their hosts, Jonny and Emma Hoare, said the first thing their families did when they met was hug. Elsewhere, a Ukrainian mother and her two daughters have found safety with a family in North Yorkshire. The refugees are among the first to arrive in the country as part of the government's Homes for Ukraine scheme. Maria and Borys were forced to leave their relatives behind and make the week-long journey across Europe before getting a flight to Gatwick. Borys said they were ""so pleased"" to meet their hosts and had been overwhelmed by the support from the community. Mr Hoare said once visas had been arranged, he would be welcoming a second family made up of a grandmother, mother and her four children, aged three, five, 10 and 15. Katya and her two children, aged six and nine, fled their home in a village near Irpin, just outside capital Kyiv, when explosions began to rain down. They have found refuge with Carrie Pillow, who lives in Thornton-le Clay in Ryedale. Describing her journey to the Romanian border, Katya said: ""We saw some soldiers and other military cars with some people lying on the ground. It was terrible and horrible."" Ms Pillow, who was compelled to help out after seeing the devastation on the news, said it been ""a lot of fun watching the children blossom"". She added: ""It's been obvious they've not been out for a long time and the community have come together to donate bikes and scooters. ""After only an hour and half sleep on Saturday, they were outside blowing bubbles, cycling and having fun."" Follow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

Mr Zelensky was addressing a joint sitting of the Oireachtas (Irish houses of parliament). ""You began doing this [supporting Ukraine] right away,"" he said. ""Thank you for supporting sanctions against Russia. ""Thank you for the humanitarian and financial support extended to our country and thank you for your caring about Ukrainian people who found shelter on your land."" However, Mr Zelensky, whose remote address to Irish parliament members comes six weeks after the invasion began, called for the Irish government to convince EU partners to introduce tougher sanctions against Russia. The EU is meeting later on Wednesday to discuss further sanctions after allegations of Russian war crimes. ""We have to put an end to trading with Russia,"" the Ukrainian president said. ""We have to cut ties of the Russian banks to the global system and cut the sources of their income from oil that they use for their weapons and killing."" He also accused Russia of ""deliberately provoking a food crisis"" in Ukraine by targeting storage depots. ""They are blocking humanitarian access to the half-million people in Mariupol who can no longer melt snow for water. ""They are bombing 24/7. There is no single house left intact"", Mr Zelensky said. He added that Russian forces had blocked all of Ukraine's sea ports and ships, and were ""destroying things that are sustaining livelihoods"". Ukraine is one of the world's biggest producers in agriculture and food and the country's president said Russia's actions would lead to a shortage of food and heightening costs for millions of people across the globe. ""For them hunger is a weapon against us, ordinary people, as an instrument of domination,"" he added. He said that at least 167 children have been killed since the war began. Mr Zelensky told the Oireachtas: ""I am sure your leadership can make a difference and change this. ""I'm sure that the whole of Europe can stop this war and bring peace and stability to east of Europe. We can not delay any longer."" The Ukrainian president received a standing ovation after he finished his address. by Shane Harrison, Dublin correspondent President Volodymyr Zelensky has been masterful at keeping his country's plight in the international spotlight and pricking the world's conscience. He often tailors his message to his audience and in his address to the Irish parliament he mentioned Russian colonialism - perhaps mindful of the Irish experience of British rule. He didn't labour the point though - again perhaps mindful of British military assistance to his soldiers, especially anti-tank weapons made in Belfast, a two-hour-and-thirty minutes drive from Dublin. References to Russia using hunger as a weapon of war may also have reminded his audiences of Ireland's Great Famine in the middle of the 19th Century. He thanked the Irish government and its people for their support for sanctions, for showing humanitarian concern to fleeing refugees, and for supporting Ukraine's efforts to join the European Union as soon as possible. President Zelensky struck a chord and was given a standing ovation by nearly all present. Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) Mícheál Martin said Ireland supported Ukraine and could never be neutral when it came to war crimes. Other politicians made similar points with Mary Lou McDonald, the leader of Sinn Féin, the main opposition party, again calling for the expulsion of the Russian ambassador. The Ukrainian ambassador, sitting in the Distinguished Visitors' Gallery, clapped enthusiastically when she heard that. But, in the meantime, despite the international displays of solidarity with President Zelensky and his beleaguered people, the war in Ukraine and the killings continue. The policy has a long history, with the state remaining neutral during World War Two. The origins of this comes partly from the centuries-old Irish conflict with British imperialism and partly from the moral view that wars are wrong. Ireland made it clear it could not join the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (Nato) after World War Two because of partition - Northern Ireland remains part of the UK. Irish soldiers do frequently serve in UN peacekeeping and peace-enforcement missions. The conflict in Ukraine has brought the policy under renewed scrutiny. However, while the state is militarily neutral, it was never politically neutral - and political leaders have made it clear that it is not neutral on Ukraine. Read more here. "

Nataliia Ternova and Volodymyr Ternovyi fled their home in Bila Tserkva, about 50 miles (80km) south of Kyiv, after Russian attacks. Their journey to the UK included a 36-hour bus journey to Slovakia. They are staying with their daughter Tanya Noble and her family in Bracknell, Berkshire. Mrs Ternova, speaking through Mrs Noble, said they had been woken up early as Russian planes bombed Bila Tserkva as the invasion began. Mrs Noble said: ""Above their home there were two planes chasing each other - a Russian plane and a Ukrainian plane. ""In the end the Russian [plane] fell not far from them. Mum said they were so were scared, they ran into the bathroom and Mum hid herself. ""They said: 'We just couldn't handle being so stressed all the time and waiting for something to hit their home directly so decided to leave.'"" Mrs Ternova said: ""We still don't realise [what's happening]. It's like a hell, it's so scary, there aren't even words to describe."" Mr Ternovyi's sister remains in Kyiv with her daughter, son-in-law and grandchild. ""I'm am very stressed and worried about them,"" he said. While both are thankful for the reception they have received in Bracknell following their arrival on 25 March, they want to return to their homeland as soon as possible. ""We had a very good life, we worked our whole life,"" Mrs Ternova told BBC Radio Berkshire. ""We finally retired. We had a nice flat in the town centre with a garden. We thought we would have a nice, quiet life and now we've got nothing,"" Despite initial concern that her parents might have had to leave Slovakia for the Polish capital, Warsaw, to apply for UK visas last month, Mrs Noble was ultimately able to secure them herself in a week.

828,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-61007427,2022-04-06T11:16:18,Borodyanka: 'There are a lot of people left under the rubble'," The destruction in the centre of Borodyanka is the worst for its size I have seen in any of the towns around Kyiv, including Irpin and Bucha, which were much fought over. Down the main street from the roundabout at the entrance to the town there is a massive amount of damage. Destroyed and burnt-out buildings, homes turned to rubble, the twisted wreckage of cars, and then more collapsed buildings. Borodyanka, which is not far from the border with Belarus and was on the main axis of the Russian advance on Kyiv, has been very heavily shelled. It is not the kind of shelling that happens in a couple of bombardments. This takes application. Several witnesses told the BBC that Russian troops stopped attempts to dig survivors out of wrecked buildings, threatening people who wanted to do so at gunpoint. Ukrainian officials say that the Russians may have committed worse atrocities in Borodyanka than in Bucha, where bodies of men who looked to have been summarily killed were found lying in the street after the Russians pulled out, and several hundred other bodies were in a mass grave. At the moment, though, the extent of what was done to civilians in Borodyanka during the Russian occupation is not yet clear. The reason is that the rubble of bomb sites has not yet been moved. Those in the town believe that corpses of civilians are lying under them, but the number is not known. The worst killing in Borodyanka might have come when several large blocks of flats were destroyed. In a line of big cream-coloured buildings, several have been flattened. The fire-blackened gaps that they occupied are like missing teeth. Tons of concrete and steel collapsed into the cellars under the flats. Several people said dozens of civilians were lying dead under the rubble. The police said it could be hundreds. They are waiting for cranes and heavy lifting gear to start moving huge amounts of rubble to recover bodies. Dmytro Stashevskyi, a middle-aged man, is lucky to be alive. I met him when he was cleaning up a smashed and looted shop he rented out as a pharmacy. His family left Borodyanka on 24 February when the Russians invaded. Dmytro stayed on to safeguard their property. The Russians were moving tanks and men through the town, so with his neighbours, he spent much of his time in the cellar under their building, day as well as night. By the evening of 1 March he decided that he had to sleep somewhere less exposed to the Russians, so went to another shelter on the edge of town. When he returned in the morning the building was rubble and the cellar where he had been staying with friends and neighbours was filled with twisted concrete and steel. ""I came back at 08:30 in the morning and the apartment was already destroyed. My mum, my wife and daughter were all praying for me. Before it all happened, there was talk of Russian tank columns moving through the city and shooting at everything. I didn't believe it at first, but then I saw them shooting at civilian houses."" Dmytro's wife Svetlana was trying to clear up his mother's destroyed flat in the building next door, which was still standing. She said the Russians stopped attempts to rescue any survivors. ""They were all our neighbours"", she said. ""Shortly after the attack, people nearby heard some voices, Russian soldiers stopped them digging. They threatened to shoot if they tried."" ""There are a lot of people left under the rubble,"" confirmed another woman, Maria, who was busy sorting mirrors and pictures that could be salvaged and throwing the rest into a skip behind her apartment block. ""My soul hurts. I knew all those people. We knew they were there from the first day, but they wouldn't let us get them out."" Maria and many others told us that Russian troops looted their property. The Russians ""stole everything that glittered,"" she said. ""They even took my lingerie. They beat everything, they gutted everything… it's all smashed."" Many people left Borodyanka when the invasion began on 24 February. A few who have come back were walking around the ruins, dazed and distressed by what they were seeing. Svitlana Gontar, who had just returned on Tuesday morning, sobbed as she saw what had become of her hometown. ""It was so green. It was really nice. Kids studied here. We had three schools, a technical and a music college. Now, we don't have anything. Children have lost their childhood, their memories, everything."" Outside the golden-domed Ukrainian Orthodox church, a local priest, Father Dmytro, was supervising the distribution of bread. He said he had witnessed Russian snipers killing civilians. ""It was the 2 March near the petrol station. We were driving along, followed by two civilian cars. They just shot them - it was an execution."" ""Since the Russians left, we have tried to provide humanitarian aid - mostly supplies from western Ukraine. But it has to be food that will keep. Most people still don't have any power or heat."" The biggest bomb sites in Borodyanka could only have been hit by air strikes or ballistic missiles. The laws of war state civilians are protected and killing them is a crime unless they are involved with military action. Unless it can be proved that the blocks of flats were military sites, then their destruction and the death of the hundreds whose bodies local police fear lie underneath, could amount to a war crime. Reports of actions by Russian forces in Ukraine that could be crimes of war are accumulating. One question is what redress, if any, will be available for victims and their families. The best recent example was the war crimes tribunal in The Hague that prosecuted some of the worst perpetrators in the wars of former Yugoslavia in the 1990s. That was authorised by the UN Security Council. But Russia is a veto-wielding permanent member, so that avenue is likely to be closed for Ukraine. Father Dmytro has no doubt about what Russia's actions in his country amount to. ""[The Russians] did everything possible to destroy the country of Ukraine. This was not a war between armies - this war was against the entire country of Ukraine."" "

Two Farmers, which relies on the oil for its products, said it was trying not to increase its own price. But if the increase continues long term then the costs may have to be passed on, the firm said. Supplies received on Tuesday night cost about 145% more than the business was paying 18 months ago. Ukraine and Russia produce most of the world's supply of the oil and the war is disrupting exports. Two Farmers in Ross-on-Wye began when Mark Green and Sean Mason, who grow and sell potatoes, started a business venture making environmentally-friendly crisps. Mr Mason said it had sourced some amounts of the oil to ""keep us going, but the price increase has been colossal"". Eighteen months ago the firm was paying about £980 for a container which could hold 1,000 litres (220 gallons). ""These ones that came in last night were £2,400 each,"" Mr Mason said. The farmer said the business had ""probably got enough"" of the oil ""to run us through for probably two more months"". ""We're trying to ride it through at the minute and hold our price in without increasing it if we possibly can. ""But long term, if it continues at this price or continues to increase, then this probably... [we'll] have to pass on."" The farmer stated costs ""across everything that we use"" were increasing, including packaging. But he also said: ""What we're suffering is very small compared to what the people of Ukraine are suffering."" Follow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

Moscow and some customers have accused the firm of being anti-Russian, and threatened to boycott the brand. Chanel says it is just complying with European Union (EU) sanctions, which ban the sale to Russia of luxury goods priced at more than €300 ($327; £250). Many Western firms halted operations in Russia after the Ukraine war started. Chanel told the BBC that sanctions, imposed by the EU, as well as Switzerland, also prohibit the sale of luxury items to individuals who intend to use them in Russia. The company said it ""complies with all laws applicable to our operations and employees worldwide, including trade sanction laws"". ""This is why we have rolled out a process to ask clients for whom we do not know the main residency to confirm that the items they are purchasing will not be used in Russia,"" Chanel said in a statement. ""We are currently working on improving this approach and we apologise for any misunderstanding this may have caused,"" the company added. ""Welcoming all our clients, regardless of where they come from, is a priority for Chanel."" Some Russians have said that they have been turned away from Chanel stores around the world. Influencer Anna Kalashnikova said on Instagram that she was stopped from buying Chanel products in Dubai. Ms Kalashnikova posted: ""Since I often come to Dubai as the host of Fashion Week, the managers of Chanel recognised me, approached me and said: We know that you are a celebrity in Russia. We know that you will go there, so we can't sell you our brand items."" ""Western boutiques ask for identification data, and when you [give] a Russian number, the salesmen say, now we sell things to Russians only under the promise that they will not take them to Russia and that they will not wear them there,"" Ms Kalashnikova said. ""Russiaphobia in action. I experienced it myself,"" she added. In an Instagram video, Russian model Victoria Bonya cut up what appears to be a black quilted Chanel bag. ""Bye bye"" Ms Bonya said as she threw the pieces aside. ""If Chanel house does not respect their clients, why do we have to respect Chanel house?"" she said. Earlier this week, Russia's foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova said ""A number of bloggers reported that official Chanel brand stores abroad refused to sell their products to Russian citizens"". Ms Zakharova accused Chanel of joining ""the Russophobic campaign to cancel Russia"". Many Western brands have halted their operations in Russia. Early in March, luxury retailers Chanel, LVMH, Hermes and Kering said they would temporarily shut their shops in the country. On Tuesday, the EU, along with the US and G7, said it would propose further sanctions against Russia, following allegations of Russian war crimes in Ukraine. European Commission head Ursula von der Leyen said the planned measures included an import ban on coal and a ban on Russian ships and road operators. The G7 (Group of Seven) is an organisation of the world's seven largest so-called ""advanced"" economies, which dominate global trade and the international financial system. They are Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK and the United States. Earlier measures have targeted individuals including Russian President Vladimir Putin and hundreds of Russian politicians and oligarchs, as well as the country's financial and energy sectors. "

Since arriving in the Port Talbot area to live with Olga's sister Olena, she has been unable to open a bank account, get benefits or secure school meals. The UK government has said its refugee scheme was ""one of the fastest and biggest visa programmes in UK history"". Olga said the family had received a huge welcome in Wales and she was very grateful for the support of the local community. ""We have received such huge support from the Welsh people. I really appreciate all the help I received,"" she said. ""I've met a lot of friends here, I've met a lot of people who wanted really to help us, not only by words but also in deed. I'm really grateful to Welsh people for everything."" But since arriving on 14 March, Olga has struggled with paperwork. ""I have no bank account [which I can access in the UK]. They have no instructions [at the bank]. They want to help, but they are unable as they have no mechanisms to be able to help me. ""I have to wait. I have to receive Universal Credit confirmation. I have received BRP (biometric residence permit) and National Insurance number, but only with the help of my family. ""The people in the job centre, they don't know what to do with us - those like me. They don't have instructions or mechanisms. They can't help right now. It's taking time to create the instructions and mechanisms."" A successful businesswoman in Ukraine, her company employs 100 people. Despite it being very difficult for the company to operate, her husband, still in Ukraine, is managing the business and ensuring staff are being paid. But since fleeing, Olga has been left frustrated by the bureaucracy which has thwarted her efforts to fully integrate and contribute to society. ""We need clear instructions. For now they don't exist. I'm trying to find myself here, trying to get used to live here."" ""I don't want to be a burden. I don't want to be just a refugee paid for by the UK government. I got used to being a businesswoman in my country, I want to do the same here. I wish I were able to. I'm waiting."" Her daughter Alexa, began studying at a local primary school last week. Newyddion S4C was given special access to the school, which is not being named to maintain the family's privacy. Alexa has settled well and said she is enjoying studying mathematics, reading and English and playing with new friends. Each of her classmates has drawn a welcome card and the teachers preparing a short written note and photograph to introduce themselves. Several members of staff and families of classmates have also donated clothes. But on Friday, Olga received an email telling her she is not eligible for free school meals for Alexa as she is not in receipt of benefits or receiving a taxable annual income of less than £16,190. Despite repeatedly attempting to register for benefits and to begin looking for work, she has been told she will not receive anything until 25 April - almost a month and a half after arriving in Wales. Aled Edwards, who sits on the Welsh government's taskforce for accepting Ukrainian refugees, confirmed the difficulties faced by Olga Samsonenko are commonplace. ""Those of us who advocate for refugees and work alongside them would say there's a rationale for providing them with financial means as soon as you can, particularly those who are able to work. ""But the Afghan model, Syrian model and now the Ukrainian reality would tell us there are enormous challenges in putting that system in place. ""It is regrettable there's a delay to people getting financial means."" The UK government's Department for Work and Pensions said: ""People in the UK on either the Homes for Ukraine and Ukraine Family scheme have three years' leave to remain and have full access to work, study and benefits. ""They can apply for Universal Credit from day one and no-one has to wait five weeks for their first payment. People in these schemes will also receive an additional £200 payment whilst their Universal Credit claim is processed."" ""Taken together, our generous schemes are one of the fastest and biggest visa programmes in UK history, with over 29,000 visas issued and thousands more expected to come through these uncapped routes.""

""I feel happy to be here, but unhappy because of what's happening to our friends back home,"" said Olga. Her family fled their home in Kyiv for Lviv initially, and packed their life into two small suitcases in 20 minutes. ""We've been given clothes, a bike for [son] Roman and everyone asks 'What can we do for you? I'm grateful,"" she said. They were taken in by Catrina Hosie, who lives in Hinton St. George in Somerset. She has given up two thirds of her house for the family and decided to host refugees after watching news of the Russian invasion on TV. ""I said, 'I just wanted to give the children some sleep at night and play during the day'. ""They were tired and emotional, the children were mad about eating soft fruit. ""They have seen things they shouldn't have, it must be hard for them to process."" Twenty five miles away (40km) in Kingston St. Mary, another mother called Olga said her family was safe following a fraught journey. They had just 40 minutes to pack their life into cases. ""We were told we could just go to Britain but we got stopped in France because that wasn't true,"" Olga, 39, said. Host Julie O' Donnell said it had been ""complicated"" to bring the family to the UK. ""The forms ask so many unnecessary questions, like asking six or seven-year-olds if they've ever served in the military or have terrorism convictions,"" she said. Olga's family was matched after what Ms O' Donnell described as ""Tinder for refugees"". ""Marvellous volunteers have set up Facebook pages to start conversations with families needing help,"" she said. Olga said she was so grateful for the fresh start. ""We feel safe - not only safe, like we're at home,"" she said. Follow BBC West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. Send your story ideas to: bristol@bbc.co.uk "

Images of mass graves and bodies of civilians reportedly executed in the Kyiv suburb have shocked the world. India's condemnation at the UN meeting is the strongest statement it has made since Russia invaded Ukraine. Delhi has so far abstained from UN votes condemning Russia's actions. In a statement on Tuesday at the UN Security Council meeting, India's permanent representative to the United Nations TS Tirumurti said the country ""remained deeply concerned at the worsening situation and reiterates its call for immediate cessation of violence and end to hostilities"". ""The situation in Ukraine has not shown any significant improvement since the Council last discussed the issue. The security situation has only deteriorated, as well as its humanitarian consequences,"" Mr Tirumurti said. ""We hope the international community will continue to respond positively to the humanitarian needs. We support calls urging for guarantees of safe passage to deliver essential humanitarian and medical supplies."" India has a long history of pursuing a non-aligned foreign policy but is under pressure from Western countries over its diplomatic balancing act. Delhi and Moscow also share a decades-old relationship, and Russia is also India's biggest defence supplier. India recently also placed contracts for nearly six million barrels of Russian crude after prices slumped in the wake of Western sanctions on Russia. But the Indian government says this is ""literally a drop, in a larger bucket"" of its oil imports globally. Last week, Delhi was criticised by the US and Australia for considering a Russian offer that was seen as circumventing the sanctions. The civilian killings in Bucha were uncovered after Russian troops withdrew from the town. The mayor, Anatoli Fedoruk, said on Monday that at least 300 civilians had been killed, but there is no official tally yet. 'Delhi-Moscow ties to be tested' By Vikas Pandey, BBC News, Delhi India's support for an independent inquiry into civilian killings in Bucha is hardly surprising. It stopped short of blaming or naming Russia for the violence in Bucha, which was in line with its policy of neutrality over Ukraine. The West has so far appeared to be accommodating of India's stand, which largely stems from its reliance on Russian defence equipment and its historical ties with Moscow. But as allegations of atrocities in Ukraine mount, so will the pressure on Delhi to take a clearer stand. US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin on Tuesday said that Washington wanted Delhi to scale down its defence dependence on Russia. If his statement is a sign of things to come, India's policy of pushing for diplomacy over Ukraine will be seriously tested. More on this story "
838,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-61003878,2022-04-05T23:18:35,Bucha killings: 'I wish they had killed me too'," Volodymyr Abramov was trying desperately to put out the fire in his home, in the Kyiv suburb of Bucha, calling out for his son-in-law to help. Russian troops had smashed through the front gates of Volodymyr's home, opened fire at the house, and dragged Volodymyr, 72, his daughter Iryna, 48, and her husband Oleg, 40, out into the yard. The soldiers took Oleg out beyond the gate on to the pavement, Volodymyr said, and threw a grenade in through the front door of the house that exploded with a deafening bang and set the house on fire. Volodymyr grabbed a small fire extinguisher and tried in vain to extinguish the flames. ""Where is Oleg? Oleg will help!"" he shouted to his daughter. But the reply came from one of the Russian soldiers, he said. ""Oleg will not help you any more."" They found Oleg on the pavement outside the gate, and it was clear from the way he was lying that he had been forced to kneel and shot in the head at point blank range, Iryna said. He was a welder who lived a quiet life on the corner of Yablonska Street in Bucha, who was taken out of his home and killed. The killing is one of scores - if not hundreds - being uncovered in Bucha after Russian troops withdrew from the Kyiv suburb recently. The mayor, Anatoliy Fedoruk, said on Monday that at least 300 civilians had been killed. There is no official tally yet. Russia has denied any involvement in the atrocities. But its burned-out tanks litter the city. On the grounds of a church, there is an open mass grave with the dead still inside, some in black body bags, some loose in the sand. On the roads, there are bullet-riddled civilian cars - at least one with a body still inside. Houses are caved in by shelling, their driveways ploughed over by tanks. Residents have described Russian soldiers shooting civilians outside their homes with no provocation, and satellite imagery shows that bodies were lying in the streets while the Russians were still in control. The Russian soldiers who killed Oleg Abramov ""did not ask him anything"", his wife Iryna said. ""They didn't ask anything or say anything, they just killed him,"" she said. ""They only told him to take off his shirt, kneel down, and they shot him."" She wept on Tuesday as she stood on the spot where he was killed, where a dark patch of blood was still visible on the street. When she ran out and found his disfigured body, the four Russian soldiers who dragged him out were standing casually drinking water, she said. She screamed at them to shoot her, and one raised his gun, then lowered it, then raised it again, and lowered it, until Volodymyr dragged her back inside the gate. ""Those soldiers told us we had three minutes to leave and they forced us to run in our slippers,"" Volodymyr said. ""Bucha was like an apocalypse - dead bodies everywhere, the streets full of smoke."" Volodymyr and Iryna had no choice but to leave Oleg's body lying on the street and it lay there for nearly a month while they sheltered at a relative's house nearby. When it was safe to return, Volodymyr tried to bury his son-in-law on a rough patch of earth by the pavement, and the half-dug hole was still visible there on Tuesday. But exhausted by the effort, and afraid of Russian soldiers, Volodymyr carried Oleg back inside the yard and laid him there. Later, Ukrainian soldiers loaded the body into a van, Volodymyr said, and took it away. ""I have no idea how we are going to find it now,"" he said. Ukrainian authorities have now cleared the bodies off the streets of Bucha but there are fears more will be found in the basements and yards of private homes. Officials have only just begun the process of cataloguing the horrors. And so great is the damage in Bucha, it is hard to imagine the scale of the reconstruction needed to restore it to the attractive suburb it once was. Along one road through the town on Tuesday, where burned-out tanks were piled up and almost every house was destroyed, 84-year-old Hryhoriy Zamohylnyi was sweeping the street, as if oblivious to the total destruction around him. Somehow, his home was intact - the only building left undamaged along the whole stretch of road. ""I saw the war with the Germans and now this war with the Russians,"" said Zamohylnyi, a former engineer, born and raised in Bucha. ""What you see here is animal cruelty,"" he said. Addressing the UN security council on Tuesday, the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky, accused the Russians of committing the worst crimes since World War Two, and called for those responsible to be tried as the Nazis were in Nuremberg. ""The Russian military searched for and purposefully killed anyone who served our country,"" he said. ""They killed entire families, adults and children, and they tried to burn the bodies."" Ukraine has begun a war crimes investigation into Russia's actions in Bucha and nearby Irpin. It says 410 bodies have been found across the two suburbs so far. There are fears now that more atrocities will be found as the Russians retreat further and more suburbs are opened up - more bodies in the streets, more mass graves. Volodymyr and Iryna Abramov are only looking for one body, and their fear is that they will never find it. ""He was just a peaceful man, a family man, a welder, who struggled with a spine fracture and was disabled all his life,"" Volodymyr said. ""Just before he died, while I was in the yard, I saw him briefly through the open gate, on his knees, and he said his final words. He asked them why.""

Bodies laid out in the street. Others dumped in shallow graves, hands tied behind their backs. Locals describing men being rounded up and shot. Ukraine has accused Russia of war crimes, and has support in the West, with US President Joe Biden saying Russia's Vladimir Putin should stand trial. Russia denies killing civilians, and has accused Ukraine of staging the deaths to discredit its troops. So who to believe? Establishing what has happened in a conflict zone is notoriously difficult: simply getting access can be tricky. But, on top of our reporters witnessing evidence of atrocities, the BBC's verification specialists can learn a lot from images and video. What they've established contradicts Russia's denials. There is strong and growing evidence that war crimes have been committed by Russia. One morning last month, 14-year-old Yuriy and his father Ruslan left their home in Bucha to pick up supplies but were stopped by Russian troops. ""We told them that we weren't carrying any weapons and that we didn't pose any danger,"" he said. ""Then my father turned his head my way, and that's when he got shot."" He's been speaking to our reporter Hugo Bachega. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky addressed the UN security council, accusing Russia of committing the worst crimes since World War Two. He laid out accusations of Ukrainians being slaughtered, saying that Russian troops killed civilians for ""pleasure"". He urged the UN to act, arguing that not doing so would mean there was no point to the world body. ""Are you ready to close the UN? And the time of international law is gone? If your answer is no, then you need to act immediately,"" he said. Responding to Mr Zelensky's speech, Russian UN Ambassador Vasily Nebenzia said ""we've heard once again a huge amount of lies about Russian soldiers and military"". You can read our full story here. Russia is now under unprecedented sanctions over its invasion of Ukraine. But in the wake of the allegations of atrocities, the European Union is considering how to go further. The head of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, has unveiled what would be the bloc's fifth round of sanctions against Russia. Under the plans, which ambassadors will consider on Wednesday, the EU would ban imports of Russian coal and bar most Russian ships from EU ports. They are likely to be adopted. But as our Brussels correspondent Jessica Parker writes, fears of a recession mean a total ban on Russian energy is not yet on the cards. Ukraine's military says Russia's forces are regrouping, ahead of a renewed offensive in the east. The area, called the Donbas, has been the scene of an eight-year conflict between Ukraine and Russian-backed separatists. Nato's secretary general Jens Stoltenberg said that Russia will try to take the entire region. Paul Kirby, from our Europe desk, says capturing the Donbas would give President Putin an achievement to trumpet when the invasion has stalled elsewhere. The next major target for Russia could be the city of Slovyansk, analysts say, with troops advancing through nearby Izyum. You can find out more about the picture on the ground in Ukraine in our visual guide. Among the Russian forces moving into areas are reportedly members of the Wagner Group, a private military company. The battle-hardened group has operated in Syria, Libya, Sudan and the Central African Republic. It has also repeatedly been accused of war crimes and human rights abuses. This is our profile of the group. "

The foreign secretary said ""crippling"" sanctions are pushing the Russian economy back ""into the Soviet era"". More than $350bn (£266bn) of Russia's $604bn foreign currency reserves are unavailable to the regime, she added. Her call for more to be done comes amid condemnation after images of bodies in the streets of Bucha, near Kyiv, emerged after Russian troops withdrew. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has warned he believes the worst atrocities committed by Russian forces are yet to be discovered, but Russia has denied killing civilians - claiming, without evidence, that Ukraine has staged such scenes. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has released a video on social media, addressed to the Russian public, in which he accuses Russian troops of committing atrocities, including the massacre of civilians and the raping of women. Speaking in Russian at the close of the video, he says: ""Your president stands accused of committing war crimes. But I cannot believe he's acting in your name."" Ms Truss, who spoke after talks with her Polish counterpart Zbigniew Rau, urged G7 countries to go further in their sanctions ahead of G7 and Nato meetings this week. Measures she is calling for include banning Russian ships from their ports, cracking down on Russian banks, going after industries ""filling Putin's war chest"" such as the gold trade, and agreeing a timetable to eliminate imports of Russian oil and gas. Ms Truss said the only way to end the war is for Russian President Mr Putin to lose in Ukraine and will stress the urgency of stepping up sanctions, as well as giving weapons to Ukraine to defend itself. ""Although Russian troops have been defeated in their initial assault on Kyiv, there has been no change in their intent and ambition,"" she said. ""We are seeing Putin's forces set their sights on the east and south of Ukraine, with the same reckless disregard for civilian lives and their nationhood. ""So far our sanctions have had a crippling impact on those who feed and fund Putin's war machine."" Both the EU and the US are planning more sanctions on Russia this week, with EU ambassadors meeting on Wednesday to decide what steps to take. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has outlined a fifth wave of sanctions, including an import ban on Russian coal, which she said was worth 4bn euro (£3.34bn) per year. Earlier, Ms Truss agreed with her equivalent from Japan, a fellow G7 member, that the international community must increase pressure on Russia with further co-ordinated sanctions. The UK has also announced a £10m fund to support organisations in Ukraine, including those helping victims of conflict-related sexual violence. The UK will also be providing funding and technical assistance for the International Criminal Court's investigation into reports of rape. ""We have all been shocked by the scenes from Bucha,"" she said. ""These are appalling acts of the kind that we thought we left in the 20th Century."" A satellite image of the town from 19 March appears to show bodies lying in the street nearly two weeks before Russians left Bucha. The picture directly contradicts Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov's claim that footage of bodies in Bucha was ""staged"" after the Russians withdrew. It shows objects that appear to be bodies in the precise locations where Ukrainian forces subsequently found them when they regained control of the town. During the foreign secretary's visit she also praised Poland for being on the ""front line of helping Ukraine"" and for always being ""clear-eyed"" about ""Putin's malign intent"". Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba has called for countries to stop buying oil, gas and coal from Russia to avert ""new Buchas"". He described the move as the ""mother of all sanctions"", saying it would stop the war in a matter of months. "

Electricity, gas and water had been cut, and essentials were in short supply in the town, one of the first to be occupied by Russian forces as they advanced on Ukraine's capital Kyiv. Yuriy and his father hoped to pick up some medicine and food. Yuriy said a Russian soldier stopped him and his father on Tarasivska St. They immediately raised their hands. Speaking to the BBC by phone alongside his mother, Alla, the 14-year-old gave his account of what happened next. ""We told them that we weren't carrying any weapons and that we didn't pose any danger,"" he said. ""Then my father turned his head my way, and that's when he got shot… He was shot twice in the chest, right where the heart is. Then he fell."" At that point, the teenager said, the soldier shot him in his left hand and he fell too. While he was on the ground, he said, he was shot again, this time in the arm. ""I was lying on my stomach, I couldn't see anything that was happening around me,"" Yuriy said. The soldier, he said, shot again, aiming at his head. ""[But] the bullet went through my hood."" Yuriy said the soldier shot again, this time at his father's head. But Ruslan was already dead. ""I had a small panic attack, lying there with my wounded arm underneath me. I saw that my hand was bleeding,"" he said. It was only after a while, when the soldier went behind a tank, that Yuriy got up and ran, he said. The BBC has not independently verified the details of Yuriy's account, but it comes as evidence grows of atrocities committed by Russian forces while they were in control of Bucha and other towns north of Kyiv. In Bucha alone, bodies of dead men were found lying in the street, many with extensive wounds. Some had been shot through the temple, as if executed. Others had their hands or legs tied behind their backs. Some had clearly been run over by tanks. Many of the bodies were seen along a stretch of Yablonska St, just 2km (one mile) from the street where Ruslan is said to have been killed. Yuriy's mother Alla told the BBC how she had gone to see her husband after the teenager returned home and told her what had happened. She thought Yuriy could be wrong, and that Ruslan was wounded, in need of medical help. ""My son begged me not to,"" Alla said. ""He said they would kill me too."" When she tried to walk down the street, she said, her neighbours stopped her. ""[They] told me not to go further, saying the Russians were killing everyone in the territories under their control."" The next morning, Alla got her mother to help. Wearing white scarves, they went to the site of the shooting. Her mother talked to Russian soldiers and they managed to get through. They finally collected Ruslan's body, and brought it home. A photograph of the partially covered body, taken by Alla and shared with the BBC, appears to confirm Yuriy's testimony. It shows a gunshot wound to the left side of the chest, near the heart. Ruslan, a lawyer, was 49 when he was killed. He was ""active in the community,"" Alla said. ""He couldn't just sit in the shelter and wait. So, he was volunteering and helping people."" They buried him in the garden of the family home. Yuriy said the soldier who killed him was clearly Russian. His uniform was dark green, he said, typical of the Russian army. ""I saw that on his flak jacket it was written 'Russia' in Russian,"" he said. ""We were no danger to the military, we were civilians, wearing white scarves to show that,"" Yuriy said. ""It's very stupid."" Additional reporting by Svitlana Libet "

He told the UN security council that civilians had been murdered and Russian tanks had crushed people ""for pleasure"". He called for those responsible to be tried as Nazis wer at Nuremberg. Gruesome images of bodies lying in the street in towns such as Bucha have generated condemnation worldwide. After his speech by video link to the Security Council, Mr Zelensky showed a graphic video of images of dead Ukrainians, some burned and disfigured. ""The Russian military searched for and purposefully killed anyone who served our country,"" he said. ""They killed entire families, adults and children, and they tried to burn the bodies."" Russian UN Ambassador Vasily Nebenzia said there was no evidence Russian troops had carried out atrocities. ""We've heard once again a huge amount of lies about Russian soldiers and military,"" he said. As expected, President Volodymyr Zelensky launched a ferocious, passionate attack on the Russian military for its alleged violations in Bucha and elsewhere. The catalogue of horrors Mr Zelensky lists includes throats slashed, limbs cut off, and women raped in front of their children. He says there's no difference between this and the actions of terrorists, except that Russia is a member of the UN Security Council. This is the speech of a man who feels he has the highest of moral high grounds. Mr Zelensky said the UN had to act, because not doing so would mean there was no point to the world body. ""Are you ready to close the UN? And the time of international law is gone? If your answer is no, then you need to act immediately,"" he said, adding that ""accountability must be inevitable"". ""We are dealing with a state that turns its veto at the UN Security Council into the right to [cause] death,"" he said. He called for the establishment of a special international tribunal to deal with the crimes, and for Russia to be removed from the UN's Security Council. There was ""not a single crime they would not commit"", Mr Zelensky added. ""The world has yet to see they have done in other occupied cities and regions of our country."" UN Secretary-General António Guterres said he would ""never forget"" seeing images of dead civilians in Bucha. He warned the Security Council that Russia's invasion is one of the greatest challenges ever to the international order ""because of its nature, intensity, and consequences"". The US reiterated its call for Russia to be suspended from the UN Human Rights Council. Linda Thomas-Greenfield, the US ambassador to the UN, told the Security Council: ""Russia should not have a position of authority in a body whose very purpose is to promote respect for human rights."" China, which has avoided criticising the Russian invasion, said that the reports of civilian deaths in Ukraine were ""very disturbing"", but said any accusations should be based on verified facts. The Ukrainian government started a war crimes investigation on Monday after it said the bodies of 410 civilians had been found in areas around Kyiv. The images from Bucha prompted US President Joe Biden to call for his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin to be tried for war crimes. A growing number of Western nations have expelled Russian diplomats in response to the discovery of the atrocities, while new sanctions against Russia are being discussed. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and foreign affairs chief Josep Borrell will travel to Kyiv to meet the Ukrainian president later in the week, Ms von der Leyen's spokesman said. "

Eighteen people with family ties on the island have been granted visas under a UK immigration route, which has been mirrored by Manx authorities. Kate Lord-Brennan said the arrivals could stay for three years and access healthcare, education and employment. Plans to offer broader support were still being considered, she added. Ms Lord-Brennan told the House of Keys a further 21 applications were ""in the pipeline"" under a pathway to allow sponsors to host named Ukrainian friends and work colleagues who do not have family connections. The government previously announced the creation of a Isle of Man Homes for Ukraine scheme to allow those willing to offer up their homes to come forward. Ms Lord-Brennan said guidance for hosts was being prepared following advice from the third sector and the island's Ukrainian community. Jason Moorhouse MHK raised concerns that UK immigration pathways set up for Ukrainian refugees were too slow, and asked if the Manx authorities had any influence on speeding up the process. While the government was ""conscious it is taking a long time"", all arrivals via the UK ""had to go through those routes"", Ms Lord Brennan said. Talks were being held with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and countries neighbouring Ukraine over how the island could provide help to people with no connections on the island, she said. However, there were indications that many refugees preferred to join family in other countries or stay close to the region, she added. Why not follow BBC Isle of Man on Facebook and Twitter?

They have 3.6 million and 1.7 million followers respectively. Twitter said allowing Russian government officials to post freely on the social media site, whilst simultaneously limiting the platform in Russia ""creates a harmful information imbalance"". As part of Tuesday's action, content on more than 300 official government accounts will no longer be ""recommended or amplified"". This means Twitter's powerful algorithm will not promote these accounts. The targeted Russian government accounts include official ministry and embassy profiles, as well as the accounts of high-ranking Russian officials. The accounts have previously been criticised for spreading misinformation during the Ukraine war, but unlike tweets from Russian state-affiliated media outlets, they have not previously been subject to specific moderation by Twitter. On 10 March the Russian Embassy in the UK's official account claimed the bombing of a maternity hospital in the Ukrainian city of Mariupol had been faked. The claim was false. Twitter later removed tweets making the ""FAKE"" claim. Last month, a BBC investigation found further misinformation spread by official Russian government accounts, as well as evidence of coordinated activity - using multiple government accounts to drive a particular narrative - which is against Twitter's rules. Recent posts claiming civilian killings in the town of Bucha had been staged have also been debunked. However, Twitter says that it is Russia's actions in Ukraine, combined with the country's decision to block and limit social media platforms domestically, that has led to their action. ""When a government that's engaged in armed conflict is blocking or limiting access to online services within their country, while they themselves continue to use those same services to advance their positions and viewpoints - that creates a harmful information imbalance"", says Yoel Roth, Head of Site Integrity at Twitter. Twitter says it is applying the rules to any country that limits access to online services while engaging in interstate warfare. But the new rules, which came into force on Tuesday, initially only affect Russian government accounts. Although Twitter is not banned in Russia, the site has been severely slowed down, to the point of inoperability. However, Twitter says its action was not retaliatory. ""To be clear, this isn't a 'tit-for-tat' policy, where if you block Twitter then you get de-amplified by Twitter - this enforcement will occur whether Twitter is blocked or not,"" said Mr Roth. He added that Twitter will take action on media depicting prisoners of war which have been posted by government or state-affiliated media accounts. ""If we see media that's published by government or state media accounts that feature prisoners of war, or if the prisoner of war is being subjected to ill treatment, things like violence, humiliation or mockery, we will require the removal of those tweets"" he said. Twitter ""de-amplified"" Russian state media on the platform - such as Russia Today and Sputnik - on 28 February, four days after the invasion of Ukraine began. The company previously told the BBC the action had led to a ""30 percent reduction of the reach of this content"". However the action was not enforced on official Russian government accounts. Speaking last month, Tim Graham, a social media analyst at QUT Digital Media Research Centre in Australia, described it as a ""loophole"" in Twitter's moderation policies. ""It's certainly a blind spot in Twitter's defences against disinformation,"" he said. James Clayton is the BBC's North America technology reporter based in San Francisco.

Andy Morgan, from Clacton, Essex, and others used their own money and fundraised to buy the ambulances. Over the weekend they delivered the supplies and left the ambulances with medical teams in the city of Lviv. ""What we thought would be a simple journey has instead changed our lives,"" Mr Morgan said. Together with friends, he set up the not-for-profit organisation Ambulance Aid with the aim of raising money to buy and equip one ambulance - but, ""overwhelmed"" by the response, they raised enough for three ambulances and a 4x4 support vehicle. ""We listened to what the needs of people were, and came up with this idea,"" Mr Morgan said. All the vehicles were branded with red crosses ""to make them as safe as possible for use out there"", Mr Morgan said. Every ambulance was ""packed to the roof"" with items including medications no longer being used by NHS trusts, sanitary products, hand sanitising gel, and cleaning products, he said. The convoy crossed the channel at Dover on Friday - their fares and other expenses were waived by the ferry company, and fuel costs for the long journey were covered by donations from supporters. One touching donation was a large tub of sweets intended to be shared among the ambulance drivers on the journey - but posting on Facebook, the team said the first sweets were given to a little girl, seen walking on the side of a road in Ukraine with her mother, and the rest were ""used to sweet-talk the soldiers at check points"". Once in Lviv, they went to the city's opera house - a prearranged point agreed with the Ukraine medical battalion - and met a group of civilian doctors and medics, who would ensure that supplies were taken where needed, and who deployed the ambulances to Kyiv and beyond. ""We had acquired some material used to protect against glass and other debris from explosions - the seamstresses at the opera house are used to making elaborate costumes, but instead they are turning this into protective blankets for people,"" Mr Morgan said. Speaking about the journey on his way back to the UK, Mr Morgan choked back tears as he recalled seeing so many displaced people walking along roads. ""It's upsetting - you've got toddlers walking, old people in their 70s, 80s... they should be being cared for, they've walked miles and miles to get to safety - some of them, hundreds of miles. ""It's really sad - this shouldn't be happening in this day and age - it shouldn't be happening."" He said the mood of the volunteers changed dramatically during the trip to and from Ukraine. ""When we were driving down, we were quite elated, that we'd achieved something - we felt quite pleased,"" he said. ""But then, when we actually got to Poland the reality dawned on us of why we'd done it, and what we were doing it for. ""The team that went in, came out quite sombre, quite subdued, sad."" He is now preparing to fundraise for more ambulances. ""It's been phenomenal, the support we've had is just unbelievable,"" he said. ""But what we saw hit us all in different ways. I feel we've done something that will make a real difference, and doing it has changed our lives."" Find BBC News: East of England on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.
