But that may be changing. Earlier this summer, the U.S. Department of Agriculture instituted new policies to encourage American farmers to begin growing two crops on one piece of land, one after the other, a practice known as double-cropping. By changing insurance rules to lessen the risk of growing two crops, the USDA hopes to significantly increase the amount of wheat that U.S. farmers could grow every year, lessening the reliance on big wheat producers like Ukraine and Russia and eliminating bottlenecks. The idea is an intriguing development from the Ukraine war that hasn't received widespread attention. As fall approaches, it's unclear how many farmers will actually try the new system, but some who already grow two crops say it´s something farmers should consider. ""I think it´s a great idea,"" said Illinois farmer Jeff O´Connor, who has double-cropped for years and hosted President Joe Biden at an event in May to promote efforts to increase food production. ""How successful it will be, I don´t know."" Even if the effort is only moderately successful, agriculture groups are hoping for new ways of meeting a growing global demand for food while generating more profit for farmers amid high fertilizer and fuel costs. As Andrew Larson with the Illinois Soybean Association put it, ""It removes some of the hurdles and provides a lot more flexibility.""

The U.S. along with Russia, Australia and Canada usually lead the world in wheat exports, with Ukraine typically ranked fifth, though its shipments will drop this year due to the war. Double-cropping isn't new in parts of the South and southern Midwest, which have the key advantage of longer growing seasons. Those warmer temperatures let farmers squeeze in a fall planting of one crop - usually winter wheat - that is dormant over the winter and then grows and can be harvested in late spring, just as farmers plant a second crop - typically soybeans. The problem comes when cool weather delays the spring harvest of wheat, which in turn delays the planting of soybeans. And that´s where the USDA´s new effort could ease the risk of a costly planting backup. The USDA´s Risk Management Agency would streamline crop insurance approvals for farmers planting a second crop in more than 1,500 counties where double-cropping seems viable. The agency also would work with crop insurers and farm groups to promote a greater availability of coverage in other counties. In announcing its effort, the USDA said it was aiming to ""stabilize food prices and feed Americans and the world amidst continuing challenges such as the COVID-19 pandemic, supply chain disruptions, and the invasion of Ukraine by Russia."" The USDA didn't mention climate change, but the agency and other experts have long said warming temperatures will spur farmers to rethink what they grow and how. The new program is focused more on the Russian invasion of Ukraine, which is a leading supplier of wheat to people in Africa and the Middle East. After the invasion, wheat prices nearly doubled to over $12 a bushel, though since then prices have steadily dropped as supply concerns have eased, in part because of agreements that have allowed for the export of some Ukraine wheat. The USDA didn´t respond to a request for details about how many farmers the agency hopes will begin double-cropping or how much U.S production could increase. Farmers who double-crop often have smaller crops, but two smaller crops would still be significantly larger than an individual crop. A study published in August by the University of Illinois and Ohio State University found that was certainly the case this year, as high wheat prices resulted in double-cropped land in southern Illinois bringing a projected $251 per acre return for wheat and soybeans, which is $81 higher than a stand-alone soybean crop. The double-crop benefit was less dramatic in other parts of the state and could be less if wheat prices drop. Mark Lehenbauer, who raises livestock and grows row crops near Palmyra, Missouri, said he´s double-cropped for years and finds it reliably profitable. Still, he cautions that there is a years-long learning curve as farmers learn how to accomplish the task of planting one crop just as they need to harvest another. And Lehenbauer acknowledged that many farmers may simply be reluctant to take on the added risks or extra workload. ""There are a lot of extra steps in there,"" Lehenbauer said. ""It adds some complexity."" Ultimately, the biggest factor behind whether farmers begin growing an extra crop of wheat is what price they can get for the crop, said Pat Westhoff, director of the Food and Agricultural Policy Research Institute at the University of Missouri. Although prices have dropped from the peaks soon after Russia's invasion of Ukraine, they remain at the still profitable level of nearly $8 a bushel. ""It really comes down to where wheat prices go in the future,"" he said. ""Even with the drop in prices we´ve seen, wheat prices are pretty high so there should be a little more incentive for wheat double cropping in this next year than there has been."" ___ Follow Scott McFetridge on Twitter: https://twitter.com/smcfetridge Soybeans and wheats are seen in Jeff O'Connor's farm, Thursday, Aug. 4, 2022, in Kankakee, Ill.

President Aleksandar Vucic and the Serbian government have cited threats of violence from right-wing extremists, a crisis with Kosovo and economic problems facing the country amid Russia´s war in Ukraine as the reasons why they cannot handle the Sept. 12-18 events. The decision announced on Saturday has faced criticism from opposition parties in Serbia and rights activists at home and abroad, who blasted the authorities for not protecting democratic rights and caving in to pressure from extremist groups opposed to the Pride march. ""If a gathering is banned, then it will be banned,"" Vucic said. ""There will be no games with state decisions."" Organizers of the EuroPride - which includes a week of various events and a Pride march in Belgrade - have said they are yet to receive a formal ban and will appeal it in Serbia's courts. ""We will use all legal means at our disposal,"" Goran Miletic, director of Civil Rights Defenders, told The Associated Press. ""If they persist with the ban, we will gather nonetheless and walk together with our friends from abroad.""

Serbia won't allow a pan-European LGBTQ Pride event to take place in Belgrade next month, Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic said Saturday, citing threats from right-wing extremists and fears of clashes. (AP Photo/Darko Vojinovic) Members of the European Pride Organizers Association chose Serbia´s capital three years ago to host the annual event, hoping it would represent a major breakthrough for a Slavic country that is traditionally conservative and under strong influence from the Orthodox Church. Serbia is formally seeking European Union membership, but has for years been moving closer to Russia´s political orbit. The Balkan country has voted for U.N. resolutions condemning Russia´s invasion of Ukraine, but has refused to join Western sanctions against Moscow. Serbia´s liberal opposition parties and local rights groups have urged supporters to join the Pride march as part of struggle for democracy that they say is under threat in Serbia from Vucic´s autocratic regime. Miletic said that ""damage has been done already"" to the reputation of Serbia which has vowed to improve LBGTQ rights as part of the EU integration process. ""The opportunity for Belgrade to show its open face and tolerance is gone,"" he said. Holding church symbols and pictures of Russia's President Vladimir Putin, thousands of Pride opponents marched in Belgrade on Sunday. The procession dubbed ""for Serbia's salvation"" was led by the Serbian branch of the Night Wolves, the Russian biker group that is considered close to Putin. Right-wing groups in Serbia support Russian invasion of Ukraine and advocate a tough stance on Kosovo, Serbia's former province that declared independence in 2008, which Belgrade does not recognize. Nationalists want Serbia to scrap the EU bid because Belgrade must normalize ties with Kosovo if it wants to join the 27-nation bloc. Marko Mihajlovic, one of the EuroPride organizers in Serbia, told the AP he believed that Vucic's announcement about the Pride march really served to draw attention away from a deal with Kosovo that was made public only hours later. ""It (Kosovo) is a very unpopular topic,"" Mihajlovic said. ""Even if they attempt to ban it, we will march, because our lives matter and we won´t stop fighting just because somebody uses us as a political tool.""

Leonid Gozman, 72, was sentenced for his 2020 Facebook post, in which he mocked the Russian legislation that banned likening the Soviet Union to Nazi Germany, saying that ""it's wrong to put an equal mark between them - Hitler was an absolute evil and Stalin even worse."" On Tuesday, Moscow's Tverskoy District Court ruled that Gozman's remark violated the law. Gozman, a vocal critic of the Kremlin´s campaign in Ukraine, left Russia when it started but returned in June in what he has described as a ""moral"" choice. The Russian Justice Ministry has listed him as a ""foreign agent,"" a description that carries a strong pejorative meaning and implies additional government scrutiny. He was briefly detained by police in July after the Russian Interior Ministry issued a warrant for his arrest while investigating a criminal case against him. Gozman was accused of breaching the law that requires Russian citizens to notify authorities about a foreign citizenship or a residency permit. Gozman said he notified the authorities about his Israeli citizenship but they claimed that he failed to do so within the required time. The investigation in that case is still ongoing and Gozman could be sentenced to a fine or community work if found guilty."

Ivan Safronov. who worked as a journalist for a decade before becoming an adviser to the head of the Russian space corporation Roscosmos, has been in custody since his July 2020 arrest in Moscow. He has rejected the charges of passing military secrets to Czech intelligence and insisted on his innocence. Safronov's case reflects the challenges faced by Russian journalists, which have grown even tougher amid Moscow's military action in Ukraine. Safronov, who covered military and security issues for the leading Russian business daily Kommersant before joining Roscosmos, stated that he had collected all the information from open sources in the course of his work and did nothing illegal. He has argued that the investigators have failed to spell out the treason charges and explain what secrets he had allegedly revealed. Many Russian journalists and human rights activists have pushed for Safronov´s release, and some have alleged that the authorities may have wanted to take revenge for his reporting that exposed Russian military incidents and shady arms deals. Roscosmos has said that Safronov didn´t have access to state secrets, and claimed that the charges didn´t relate to Safronov´s work for the corporation, which he joined in May 2020.

Safronov´s father also worked for Kommersant covering military issues after retiring from the armed forces. In 2007, he died after falling from a window of his apartment building in Moscow. Investigators concluded that he killed himself, but some Russian media outlets questioned the official version, pointing to his intent to publish a sensitive report about secret arms deliveries to Iran and Syria."

The move will help ease one of the world´s worst humanitarian crises. The World Food Program said the MV Karteria, with 37,000 metric tons of wheat grain on board, left the Ukrainian port of Yuzhny. The WFP-chartered vessel will stop first in Turkey, where the grain will be milled into flour before sailing to Yemen, where over 17 million people are struggling with acute hunger. ""The war in Ukraine has been the last straw in Yemen against a backdrop of prolonged conflict. ... It is paramount to get commodities flowing back into the country and especially grain - for humanitarian and commercial purposes,"" said Richard Ragan, WFP´s representative in Yemen. The U.N. agency said the grain will provide a 50-kilogram (110-pound) bag of wheat flour to nearly 4 million people that will last for about a month and will help the WFP address immediate gaps in assistance. The Russian war in Ukraine, which started in February, has been deeply felt in Yemen, where a long-running conflict created one of the world´s worst humanitarian crises and pushed millions of Yemenis to the brink of famine. Yemen, the poorest Arab country, depends on direct imports of wheat flour - a key staple in Yemenis´ diet - from Russia and Ukraine. An estimated 46% of Yemen´s 2021 wheat imports came from Ukraine and Russia, according to the WFP. Yemen´s brutal civil war began in 2014, when when Iran-backed Houthi rebels seized the capital of Sanaa and much of northern Yemen and forced the government into exile. A Saudi-led coalition entered the war early the next year to try and restore the internationally recognized government to power. More than 150,000 people have been killed, including over 14,500 civilians, in the conflict that turned into a regional proxy war between rivals Saudi Arabia and Iran."

The preliminary figure, which the Federal Statistical Office reported Tuesday, is usually unchanged in a final report about two weeks later. As in other countries around the world, inflation in Germany has been stoked by Russia´s war in Ukraine, which has led to a rise in energy costs and food prices. The statistics office said energy prices were up 35.6% on the year in August and food prices rose 16.6%, while the effects of disruption to supply chains caused by the coronavirus pandemic were still being felt. Germany temporarily lowered taxes on diesel fuel and gasoline at the start of June and introduced an ultra-cheap ticket that allows people to use all local and regional public transportation for 9 euros (dollars) a month. Both of those measures are due to expire on Wednesday.

He spoke at the start of a two-day government retreat, attended also by Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez, which was focused on the impacts of Russia´s invasion of Ukraine on the energy supply in Europe. Scholz cited Germany's decisions to reactivate oil and coal-fired power plants, mandate the filling of natural gas storage facilities and lease floating liquefied natural gas terminals. A decision on extending the operating life of Germany's three remaining nuclear power plants is also expected soon. ""All of this and many further measures have contributed to us being in a much better situation as far as supply security is concerned than could have been foreseen a couple of months ago,"" Scholz told reporters at the government´s guest house in Meseberg, north of Berlin. ""We will be able to cope quite well with the threats that we face from Russia, which is using gas as part of its strategy in the war against Ukraine."" Scholz noted that gas storage facilities are already over 80% full, more than they were at this time last year, and the government is expected to agree on a further package of measures in the coming days to help German consumers cope with steeply rising energy prices.

(AP Photo/Markus Schreiber) Russia's state-controlled energy company Gazprom further reduced gas deliveries to the French company Engie, raising fears that Moscow might cut off gas completely as political leverage over the war in Ukraine. Gazprom informed Engie of a reduction in gas deliveries, starting Tuesday, because of ""a disagreement between the parties on the application of several contracts,"" according to the statement from the French energy company. Deliveries for Engie from Gazprom have significantly decreased since Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24, with recent monthly supply of 1.5 TWh, which compares to Engie´s total annual supplies in Europe above 400 TWh, the statement said. Engie had already secured the volumes necessary to meet its commitments to its customers, the statement said, adding that it has also put in place measures to ""significantly reduce any direct financial and physical impact"" that could result from Gazprom´s interruption in gas supplies. Russia has cut off or reduced natural gas to a dozen of European Union countries. Since spring, EU leaders have been appealing to the public to use less gas over the summer to build storage winter. The bloc has proposed member states voluntary cut their use by 15%. It´s also seeking the power to impose mandatory cuts across the 27-nation bloc if there is risk of severe gas shortage or very high demand. France, like other European countries, is trying to beef up its gas reserves for winter and fill up its storage by early autumn to avert an economic and political crisis. The French government has rolled out an ""energy sobriety"" plan in June, targeting a 10% reduction in energy use by 2024. Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne on Monday urged businesses to put in place energy saving plans, warning that companies would be hit first should the government be forced into rationing gas and electricity because of severe shortages. In an effort to wean themselves off Russian gas and reduce the climate impact of the energy sector, European countries have significantly ramped up efforts to build wind, solar and other renewable forms of energy production. Baltic Sea nations were due to meet Tuesday in Copenhagen, Denmark, to announce plans for a major increase in wind power production by 2030 as a way to free the region from overdependence on Russian natural gas. Finland, Sweden, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and Denmark aim to increase the capacity for offshore wind seven-fold in the Baltic Sea to just under 20 gigawatts from the current under 3 gigawatts, the Politiken newspaper wrote. Up to 1,700 new offshore wind turbines would produce power equivalent to almost 20 nuclear power plants, providing enough electricity for 22-30 million households. ""The war in Ukraine and climate change are happening at the same time. We have two crises on the table. We have to speed up the green transition, and we have to free ourselves from Russian fossil energy,"" Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said in an interview with Politiken. Her Estonian counterpart, Kaja Kallas, said in the same interview that ""you have to be connected to friends who won´t hit you in a crisis."" The daily, which had obtained a draft of the plan, said the countries have committed to increase energy cooperation in the form of strong development of offshore wind and, in the short term, import of liquefied gas. The plan is expected to be formally presented later Tuesday during a meeting of leaders from the Baltic countries and the European Union in Copenhagen. The crisis has prompted some European countries to call for previously shelved energy projects to be revived, such as a gas pipeline linking the Iberian Peninsula and the rest of Europe. ""Spain is prepared to use all its capacity to help those countries that right now are suffering more from dependency on Russia and (President Vladimir) Putin´s energy blackmail,"" Sánchez said after meeting Scholz in Meseberg. Spain has 30% of Europe´s regasification capacity, but can´t use it fully ""as a consequence of having a bottleneck,"" he said. ""That is what we have to resolve, whether it is via France or Italy,"" he said. ___ Barbara Surk reported from Nice, France, and Jan M. Olsen from Copenhagen, Denmark.

Food security experts call it a drop in the bucket for the vast needs in the worst-hit Horn countries of Somalia, Kenya and Ethiopia, the nation where this first shipment is going. But the flow of grain from Ukraine for other hungry parts of the world is expected to continue, with another ship departing Tuesday for Yemen. The U.N. World Food Program has said it is working on multiple ships. WFP says this first shipment of grain will be shipped overland to northern Ethiopia, where millions of people have been affected by the country´s Tigray conflict, which has now flared up again. How any of the grain will reach Tigray is now in question as humanitarian deliveries by road and air have been suspended amid the fighting that sparked again last week between Tigray forces and Ethiopian ones. But Ethiopia's neighboring Amhara and Afar regions also are expected to benefit. WFP has said the 23,000 metric tons of grain on the first ship are enough to feed 1.5 million people on full rations for a month. But the U.N. has said 2.4 million in Tigray alone are severely food insecure and that 20 million people across Ethiopia face hunger. Millions of other people in the Horn of Africa region are going hungry because of drought, and thousands have died. Somalia has been especially hard hit because it sourced at least 90% of its grain from Ukraine and Russia before Russia invaded Ukraine in February.

""In Ethiopia alone, three-quarters of everything that we used to distribute originated from Ukraine and Russia,"" regional director Michael Dunford said. Food security experts have said it will take weeks for people in African countries to see grain from Ukraine arrive and even longer to see it bring down high food prices that have been a source of despair and protests in multiple nations. Far more ships carrying grain from Ukraine's reopened ports have been going to richer places like Europe as existing business contracts are fulfilled. As of Sunday, 114 ships carrying more than 1.2 million metric tons of food commodities had left Ukraine, WFP said, but ""export volumes remain far below pre-conflict averages.""

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-11159875/Eyes-Kherson-Ukraine-claims-bold-Russians.html,2022-08-30,Heavy fighting rages in Ukraine's Russian-occupied south,"Ukraine claimed to have destroyed bridges and ammunition depots and pounded command posts in a surge of fighting in the Russian-occupied south, fueling speculation Tuesday that its long-awaited counteroffensive to try to turn the tide of war was underway. Russia said it repelled the attack and inflicted heavy casualties. The clashes took place in the country's Kherson region, where Moscow's forces rolled up major gains early in the war. Ukrainian authorities kept the world guessing about their intentions in the latest round of fighting and cautioned against excessive optimism in a conflict that has seen changing fortunes before. While independent verification of battlefield action has been difficult, Britain's Defense Ministry said in an intelligence report that several Ukrainian brigades had stepped up their artillery fire in front-line sectors across southern Ukraine. The port city of Kherson is an important economic hub close to the Black Sea and the first major city to fall to the Russians in the war that began six months ago. Ukraine´s presidential office reported that ""powerful explosions continued during the day and night in the Kherson region. Tough battles are ongoing practically across all"" of the area. Ukrainian forces, the office said, destroyed ammunition depots and all large bridges across the Dnieper River that are vital to bring supplies to Russian troops. The Ukrainian military also reported destroying a pontoon bridge across the Dnieper that the Russian forces were setting up and hitting a dozen command posts in the region with artillery fire.

(AP Photo/Emilio Morenatti) Russian state news agency Tass reported five explosions rocked Kherson on Tuesday morning - blasts most likely caused by air defense systems at work. Amid the talk of a major counteroffensive, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in his nightly video address on Monday that one ""won´t hear specifics from any truly responsible person"" about Kyiv´s intentions, ""because this is war."" The British defense ministry said that the most of Russia´s units around Kherson ""are likely under-manned and are reliant upon fragile supply lines"" while its forces there are undergoing a significant reorganization. Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Lt. Gen. Igor Konashenkov maintained that its forces stood up well and that Ukraine lost hundreds of troops, tanks and other armored vehicles in Monday´s action. His claim could not be independently verified. Ukrainian independent military analyst Oleh Zhdanov told The Associated Press that ""it will be possible to talk about the effectiveness of Ukrainian actions only after large cities are retaken."" He added that Ukrainian forces had breached the first and the second lines of defense in the Kherson region several times in the past, ""but it didn´t bring about results."" ""The most important thing is Ukrainian artillery´s work on the bridges, which the Russian military can no longer use,"" Zhdanov said. The war has ground to a stalemate over the past months with casualties rising and the local population bearing the brunt of the suffering during relentless shelling in the east and the south. Amid fears that the fighting around the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant could lead to a catastrophe, a team of experts from the U.N. atomic energy agency sent out on a mission to visit and safeguard the complex. Ukraine and Russia have accused each other of shelling the area over and over. Nikopol, a city just across the Dnieper from the plant, again came under a barrage of heavy shelling, local authorities said, with a bus station, stores and a children´s library damaged. And the city of Zaporizhzhia, about 50 kilometers (30 miles) from the plant, was targeted by a Russian missile strike, Ukraine said. ___ Yuras Karmanau contributed to this report from Tallinn, Estonia. ___ Follow AP´s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine Firefighters work to extinguish a fire after a Russian attack that heavily damaged a building in Sloviansk, Donetsk region, eastern Ukraine, Monday, Aug. 29, 2022.

""We are depleting our stocks. We are providing so many capacities to Ukraine that we have to refill our stocks,"" EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell told reporters in the Czech capital, Prague, where he is chairing two days of talks between the bloc´s defense and foreign ministers. The aim among defense ministers is to work out how best to pool military materiel and resources, but also to bulk purchase ammunition and weapons like air defense systems which Ukraine continues to need. They will also discuss what role the 27-nation bloc could play in training new Ukrainian recruits on European soil, as casualties mount and deplete the army of experienced soldiers while officers who might normally provide training are tied up in battle. Several countries already provide military training on a bilateral basis but some feel that it´s important to throw the EU´s combined weight behind the effort. The Netherlands highlighted new demining training that it´s providing with Germany. ""It would be good to put that on a more structured basis, and to ensure that the EU collectively is doing that in a structured and organized way that can last for some time,"" said Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney, who is also responsible for his country´s defense portfolio.

(AP Photo/Petr David Josek) Others feel that might be too unwieldy. ""It´s not maybe the quickest way. I´m not so convinced,"" said Luxembourg´s defense minister, Francois Bausch. Austria was also cool on the idea. Latvian Defense Minister Artis Pabriks said his country stands ready to help, but that such an EU-wide mission ""must be practical."" Later Tuesday, foreign ministers will discuss whether to impose further visa restrictions on Russians, in an effort to ramp up pressure on President Vladimir Putin as the war he launched six months ago inflicts heavy economic costs on European and world economies. The EU already tightened visa restrictions on Russian officials and business people in May, but calls have mounted from, notably, Poland and the Baltic countries - Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania - for a ban on tourists. ""There must be more restrictions on travel for Russian citizens,"" Pabriks said. ""We cannot simply give bonuses to people which are supporting such presidents as Putin."" But Borrell has said that a visa ban on all Russian citizens is unlikely to garner broad EU support. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Tuesday that Moscow was closely following the EU visa discussions and described them as part of Western moves against Russia that are ""irrational and bordering on madness."" He warned that any restrictions would directly target Russian citizens and that Moscow would respond.

""I need to be completely relaxed, to find a place where I will not move the rifle when I pull the trigger,"" he says. ""I don´t think about anything. It´s a kind of vacuum."" In a semicircle around his head are boxes of bullets, printouts of charts, a heavy-duty stapler and a roll of tape. Strapped to his wrist is a monitor, which is the shape of a jewelry box. It's a ballistics calculator to factor in the wind and other surrounding conditions. Bees persistently circling his head and scope are ignored. After a long pause, he says the word ""shot"" in Ukrainian. Crack! A sound not unlike a starting gun used at sporting events produces a reflexive jolt in people unaccustomed to war. Ukrainian sniper Andriy attends a training outside of Kyiv, Ukraine, Saturday Aug. 27, 2022. After moving to Western Europe to work an an engineer, Andriy scrambled back to Ukraine at the start of the war, and within weeks underwent a conversion from civilian life to a sniper being trained by the country's special forces. (AP Photo/Andrew Kravchenko) Six months ago, the noise might have startled Andriy, who had moved to Western Europe to pursue a career in engineering. His experience resembles that of many Ukrainians who returned home to the war, abruptly pulled from civilian life to embrace fighting methods - modern but also makeshift - that have held back the far larger Russian military. Andriy comes from Bucha, a district near Kyiv´s airport that was hammered during the Russian advance. Hundreds of civilian killings took place there, the bodies found in mass graves or left lying where they were shot in what the United Nations describes as potential war crimes. Tall and with a good command of English, the sniper spoke to The Associated Press while practicing alone at an informal firing range near Kyiv, hoping to resolve some issues with his weapon through hours of trial and error before his next deployment. He asked only to be identified by his first name and that some details of his civilian life remain private. Andriy scrambled home, taking a flight to Budapest and arranging an 1,200-kilometer (750-mile) overland route that included paying ""a big amount of money"" to a driver willing to take a risky journey eastward. Within a few days he had joined the ferocious fight around Kyiv, adopting the war nickname ""Samurai."" He bought his own gear and a U.S.-made sniper rifle, and began receiving training from a special forces instructor, connected through friends in the military. ""Early in the morning on Feb. 24, I received a call from my mother. She lives in Bucha and told me the war had started. She could hear helicopters, airplanes, bombing and explosions. I decided to return,"" he said. While not allowed to discuss any specifics of his operational activity, Andriy describes Ukraine´s military as a force that prides itself on flexibility, harnessing a wide range of skills from its personnel to become more versatile in combat. Snipers, he said, are often used to spot Russian military positions for artillery targeting. ""I have also gained experience in tactical medicine, with drones and shooting with assault rifles,"" he said. Military specialists are encouraged to learn new skills and even find their own equipment, with Western suppliers still delivering to Ukraine in a private market that is monitored by the army. To protect his hearing, Andriy acquired a set of hunter´s headphones that suppress the noise from his rifle while amplifying voices. ""You really need these,"" he says. Russia has more than doubled the territory it controls in Ukraine since launching the invasion in February, to about 20% of the country, but Andriy shares the optimism of many fellow Ukrainians that victory will be possible after the winter. ""I think with the help of our friends in Europe and the United States that we can push them out of our territory,"" he said. His desire to become a sniper came from a familiarity with hunting rifles, common in Ukraine, and playing the role of a distance shooter in video games. But his goal at war: ""It´s to return to my home, to my family,"" he says. ""No one of us wanted to be a warrior, a shooter, a sniper. It´s just a necessity to be here now and do what we´re doing here."" After a pause he adds: ""I don´t know how to explain this: I don´t like to kill people. It´s not something you want to do, but it´s something you have to do."" ___ Follow AP coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine Ukrainian sniper Andriy attends a training outside of Kyiv, Ukraine, Saturday, Aug. 27, 2022.

The officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the U.S. intelligence assessment, did not detail the ""numerous failures."" They added that the U.S. assesses that the delivery of Mohajer-6 and Shahed-series unmanned aerial vehicles over several days this month is likely part of a Russian plan to acquire hundreds of Iranian UAVs. The Associated Press reported last week that Russia had recently obtained hundreds of Iranian drones capable of being used in its war against Ukraine despite U.S. warnings to Tehran not to ship them. The Washington Post first reported that Russia has faced technical problems with the Iranian drones. Russian operators continue to receive training in Iran on how to use these systems, which can conduct air-to-surface attacks, electronic warfare and targeting, on the battlefield in Ukraine, the officials said. The Biden administration last month released satellite imagery indicating that Russian officials visited Kashan Airfield on June 8 and July 5 to view the Iranian drones. At the time, White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan asserted that the administration has ""information that the Iranian government is preparing to provide Russia with several hundred UAVs."" Facing economic sanctions and limits on its supply chains due to its invasion of Ukraine, Russia is turning to Iran as a key partner and supplier of weapons. Russian aircraft was loaded with the UAV equipment at an airfield in Iran over several days this month before the weaponry was flown to Russia, the officials said. Workers drain water from a crater created by an explosion that damaged a residential building after a Russian attack in Slovyansk, Ukraine, Sunday, Aug. 28, 2022. (AP Photo/Leo Correa) White House national security council spokesman John Kirby told reporters earlier Monday that the administration had ""no update"" on whether the drones had been delivered. He added that the U.S. has has ""seen nothing that that gives us a sense of comfort"" and that ""the procurement, and delivery is still looming, is still in the offing."" Iran´s foreign minister, Hossein-Amir Abdollahian, said last month that Tehran had ""various types of collaboration with Russia, including in the defense sector."" ""But we won´t help either of the sides involved in this war because we believe that it (the war) needs to be stopped,"" he said. The administration officials confirmed details of Iran supplying Russia with drones at a moment when the White House is also trying to prod Tehran to resume its compliance with the 2015 nuclear deal. The administration last week c ompleted its review of Iran´s comments on a European proposal to restart the agreement that was brokered during President Barack Obama's administration and scrapped by in 2018 by then-President Donald Trump in 2018."

This win - her first on the WTA Tour - was for Ukraine. Snigur pulled off the first big upset of the U.S. Open, knocking off No. 7 seed Simona Halep 6-2, 0-6, 6-4 on Monday. Days after taking part in an exhibition to raise money for her country that is fighting a war against invading Russia, Snigur fought through tears as she tried to explain what the victory meant to her family and her home. ""No comment, I think, because it´s impossible for me now,"" Snigur said. The 20-year-old was making her first appearance in the main draw of a Grand Slam after emerging through the qualifying rounds last week.

(AP Photo/Seth Wenig) On Wednesday, she joined tennis superstars such as Rafael Nadal, Coco Gauff, John McEnroe, Iga Swiatek and 2021 U.S. Open runner-up Leylah Fernandez in the ""Tennis Plays for Peace Exhibition,"" an event organized by the U.S. Tennis Association that raised $1.2 million. It took place in Louis Armstrong Stadium, which may have calmed Snigur's nerves when she was sent back out there Monday. ""I think it helped me because I was here in `Tennis Plays for Peace´ and I think it helped me a little bit,"" Snigur said during an on-court interview. Snigur won the Wimbledon girls singles title in 2019, but failed in her first eight attempts to qualify for the main draw of a Grand Slam before finally breaking through. She was 0-2 on tour and was facing a top-20 opponent for the first time. And in Halep, it was one of the hottest players in women's tennis. The two-time Grand Slam champion had won 19 of her previous 22 matches and recently returned to the top 10. But Snigur responded nicely after Halep won the second set, racing to a 5-1 lead in the third. Halep fought off a couple match points while taking the next three games before Snigur finally closed it out when Halep sailed a backhand long. Snigur then dropped her racket and covered her face as she fought back tears. Elina Svitolina´s run to the 2019 semifinals is the best performance by a Ukrainian in the U.S. Open. One of five of them in this year's draw, Snigur will face Canadian Rebecca Marino on Wednesday. First, she was going to savor a stunner.

""It seems like a long time ago,"" Murray said of his victory over Djokovic in 2012. ""A lot´s happened since then in my career.""

Many fans arriving for the day session at the final Grand Slam event of the season were focused on the match that would lead off the action at night. Williams, the 23-time major champion, has said she is preparing to end her tennis career. Coco Gauff wasn't going to miss it, saying she was going to change plans and attend instead of watching on TV in her hotel room. ""As I thought about it, I was, like, I have to watch,"" the 18-year-old American said after her straight-sets victory. ""I´m excited and, you know, it´s not often we watch live matches, to be honest.""

They faced more comfortable conditions after a hot start under a sunny sky in Flushing Meadows. Leading 3-0 in the third set, Medvedev told the chair umpire he wanted a bag of ice so he could put it on his head. ""It was pretty hot today and humid,"" Medvedev said. ""I see the other guys coming from five-setters in the locker room, pretty red faces. That´s also fun in a way sometimes to get through these conditions. Even today, the match was maybe not that intensive and long, but, yeah, I sweated a lot and it was not easy."" Taylor Fritz, the No. 10 seed, said he he struggled with the windy conditions in his four-set loss to qualifier Brandon Holt, the son of two-time U.S. Open women's champion Tracy Austin. Snigur was playing her first match in the main draw of a Grand Slam. The 20-year-old wore a ribbon in the blue and yellow colors of Ukraine's flag on her chest, and she put her hands around it after finishing off the victory. She played last week in the ""Tennis Plays for Peace Exhibition"" to raise money to aid Ukraine. That was on Louis Armstrong Stadium, which may have calmed her nerves a bit when she was sent back out onto the same court Monday. ""I think it helped me because I was here in `Tennis Plays for Peace´ and I think it helped me a little bit,"" Snigur said as she fought through tears during an on-court interview. Halep had won 19 of her last 22 matches and recently returned to the top 10, but the U.S. Open has been the most challenging major for the two-time Grand Slam champion. She is 21-11 in New York and has lost in the first round of three of her last five appearances. Bianca Andreescu, the 2019 U.S. Open champion, needed three sets to get past Harmony Tan, the French player who beat Williams in the first round at Wimbledon. Two other past champions had short stays. Dominic Thiem, the 2020 champion who missed last year because of injury, fell to Pablo Carreño Busta in four sets. The 2016 winner, Stan Wawrinka, retired from his match against Corentin Moutet after losing a second-set tiebreaker. He has been plagued by injuries in recent years. No. 29 seed Tommy Paul overcame the heat to outlast Bernabe Zapata Miralles 4-6, 6-3, 2-6, 6-0, 7-5 in 3 hours, 10 minutes. Fellow American Sebastian Korda also got his first win at his home Slam, beating Facundo Bagnis in four sets. Another American advanced in an upset, with J.J. Wolf ousting No. 16 seed Roberto Bautista Agut in straight sets. Also, Wu Yibing became the first Chinese man to win a U.S. Open match in the professional era, upsetting No. 31 seed Nikoloz Basilashvili 6-3, 6-4, 6-0. He had played his way into the field through the qualifying tournament, joining countryman and fellow qualifier Zhang Zhizhen as the first Chinese men in the U.S. Open main draw since the open era began in 1968. Zhang lost his first-round match. Third-seeded Maria Sakkari and No. 17 Caroline Garcia were among the early winners on the women's side, with Sakkari overcoming Wimbledon semifinalist Tatjana Maria in three sets. ___ More AP coverage of U.S. Open tennis: https://apnews.com/hub/us-open-tennis-championships and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports Daniil Medvedev, of Russia, returns a shot to Stefan Kozlov, of the United States, during the first round of the US Open tennis championships, Monday, Aug. 29, 2022, in New York.

Brandon Holt, Austin´s son, knocked off No. 10-seeded Taylor Fritz in four sets after advancing through the qualifying tournament into his first Grand Slam main draw. Holt says he couldn´t remember what advice Austin, the 1979 and 1981 U.S. Open women´s champion, gave him before the match, but that it was probably to have fun and enjoy it. Austin also owned a victory over Kathy May, Fritz´s mother, from a tournament in Philadelphia in 1978. Brandon Holt, of the United States, reacts after defeating Taylor Fritz, of the United States, during the first round of the US Open tennis championships, Monday, Aug. 29, 2022, in New York. (AP Photo/Frank Franklin II) Mandlikova´s daughter, Elizabeth Mandlik, received a wild card into the tournament and edged Tamara Zidansek 5-7, 7-6 (3), 6-4. Mandlikova won the 1985 U.S. Open for one of her four Grand Slam singles titles. ___ 11:30 p.m. Danka Kovinic heard the roars of the crowd early in her match against Serena Williams and one thing quickly came to mind. Kovinic said to herself: ""OK, if they´re going to be this loud the whole match, it's going to be tough."" Williams beat her 6-3, 6-3, but Kovinic felt she played better than the score. She thought she handled Williams' power well, but acknowledged some difficulty with the noise. The 27-year-old from Montenegro said she sometimes had trouble gauging how far Williams' shots would go because she couldn't hear the sound off the racket. But she loved the opportunity to play the 23-time Grand Slam singles champion, calling it ""an experience that I only could think of and dream of maybe in my entire career."" ___ 10:50 p.m. Serena Williams is not ready to declare that the U.S. Open will be her last hurrah. Asked after her first-round victory Monday night whether this will definitively be her final tournament, Williams replied with a knowing smile: ""Yeah, I´ve been pretty vague about it, right?"" And then she added: ""I´m going to stay vague, because you never know."" When she announced three weeks ago she was ready to move on from being a tennis player, Williams indicated the U.S. Open could be it for her, but she never explicitly said it would be. ___ 9:55 p.m. Serena Williams promises that whatever she does after tennis, she will still be intense like she was as a player. Williams says her next chapter will be ""like Serena 2.0."" Williams still didn't definitively say she was retiring during a ceremony after her first-round victory over Danka Kovinic. But the 23-time Grand Slam singles champion made it clear she is ready for different things, saying ""there´s other chapters in life."" The ceremony, which included her husband and daughter coming onto the court as well as Billie Jean King, included a tribute narrated by Oprah Winfrey titled ""Dear Serena."" It ended by saying: ""Just know whatever you do next, we´ll be watching. With love, all of us."" ___ 9:15 p.m. Serena Williams will get at least one more singles match in what could be the final tournament of her career. Williams pulled away to beat Danka Kovinic 6-3, 6-3 for her record 107th victory at the U.S. Open. The 23-time Grand Slam singles champion advances to face No. 2 seed Anett Kontaveit of Estonia on Wednesday. ___ 8:30 p.m. Serena Williams is halfway to starting her U.S. Open with a victory after taking the first set 6-3 against Danka Kovinic. Williams won the first two games, dropped the next three, and then regained her grip before closing it out in 55 minutes. Williams has said she is preparing to end her tennis career, but a victory would send her into a second-round match against No. 2 seed Anett Kontaveit of Estonia. ___ 7:35 p.m. Serena Williams is back on the court she has dominated like none other - perhaps for the last time. The 23-time Grand Slam singles champion has started her first-round match against Danka Kovinic of Montenegro. Williams has said she is preparing to end her tennis career, which could come after this tournament she has won six times. With Spike Lee on the court for the coin toss and Queen Latifah narrating a tribute video, there was far more hype than the usual first-day match. Williams emerged from the locker room wearing a glittery jacket and long skirt after being introduced as the greatest of all time. Williams then held serve to open the match, hitting consecutive aces after she faced two break points. ___ 6:50 p.m. Serena Williams has wrapped up her final practice before the U.S. Open after a half-hour. As she walked along the courts, back toward Arthur Ashe Stadium, fans shouted her name, ""Serenaaaaa!"" She lifted her arm to wave her racket in acknowledgement. She then took a drink from a water bottle and kept walking, lips pursed, toward the stadium for what could be the last singles match of her prolific career. ___ 6:30 p.m. Serena Williams has started a warmup session on a practice court just outside Arthur Ashe Stadium before her first-round match at the U.S. Open. Williams was greeted by screams from fans who filled the stands at the practice area as she took the short walk from Ashe about 45 minutes before she is due to face Danka Kovinic. Before grabbing her racket, Williams walked over to greet her good friend, former tennis player Caroline Wozniacki, and Wozniacki´s husband, former NBA player David Lee, with hugs. Williams began trading shots from the baseline with her hitting partner as coach Eric Hechtman and advisor Rennae Stubbs looked on. ___ 4:10 p.m. Ukrainian Daria Snigur's first career win on the WTA Tour was a big one. The 20-year-old stunned No. 7 seed Simona Halep 6-2, 0-6, 6-4 in the first round of the U.S. Open, then struggled through tears to explain what the victory meant to her family and her country during its war with Russia. Snigur wore a pin in the colors of Ukraine's flag on her chest and put her hands around it after the final point. Snigur took part last week in the ""Tennis Plays for Peace Exhibition"" in Louis Armstrong Stadium to raise money to aid Ukraine, and she said that might have helped her nerves when she returned to the same court Monday. Halep had won 19 of her last 22 matches and recently returned to the top 10, but the two-time Grand Slam champion has struggled at the U.S. Open throughout her career. ___ 3:15 p.m. Wu Yibing has become the first Chinese man to win a U.S. Open match in the professional era. Wu upset No. 31 seed Nikoloz Basilashvili 6-3, 6-4, 6-0. He had played his way into the field through the qualifying tournament, joining countryman and fellow qualifier Zhang Zhizhen as the first Chinese men in the U.S. Open main draw since the open era began in 1968. Wu won the 2017 U.S. Open boys singles and doubles titles. Zhang lost to Tim van Rijthoven in five sets. ___ 2 p.m. Andy Murray has reached the second round of the U.S. Open with one of the first upsets of the tournament. Murray beat No. 24 seed Francisco Cerundolo of Argentina 7-5, 6-3, 6-3. Murray won the first of his three Grand Slam titles 10 years ago in Flushing Meadows. No. 16 seed Roberto Bautista Agut of Spain was another seeded loser, beat in straight sets by American J.J. Wolf. Third-seeded Maria Sakkari and No. 17 Caroline Garcia were among the early winners on the women's side. ___ 12:20 p.m. A small group of demonstrators chanting ""Novak! Novak!"" outside the entrance of the U.S. Open urged an end of the vaccine travel mandate that kept Novak Djokovic from competing in this year's tournament. Djokovic, who is from Serbia, was not able to travel to the U.S. because he is not vaccinated against COVID-19. He was able to compete during the previous two U.S. Opens held during the pandemic, but the current vaccine requirement began last Nov. 8. Members of Families are Essential and Children´s Health Defense & Teachers for Choice were among the demonstrators, standing behind signs that read ""End The Travel Mandate Now!"" ___ 11:15 a.m. With Serena Williams on the schedule at night, the U.S. Open has begun with far more buzz than usual for Day 1. Play has started at the final Grand Slam of the year, with defending champion Daniil Medvedev among the players who will be in early action Monday. Medvedev, who won his first Grand Slam title last year in Flushing Meadows, plays the lead match in Arthur Ashe Stadium against American Stefan Kozlov at noon. Past U.S. Open champion Andy Murray is facing No. 24 seed Francisco Cerundolo of Argentina in one of the matches that has begun. Williams will begin the night session in Ashe for the start of what could be the final tournament of her career. The 23-time Grand Slam singles champion faces Danka Kovinic. Dominic Thiem, the 2020 champion who missed the tournament last year, also is on the schedule, along with past U.S. Open champions Stan Wawrinka and Bianca Andreescu. ___ More AP coverage of U.S. Open tennis: https://apnews.com/hub/us-open-tennis-championships and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports Danka Kovinic, of Montenegro, reacts after losing a point to Serena Williams, of the United States, during the first round of the US Open tennis championships, Monday, Aug. 29, 2022, in New York.

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said in a speech in Bled, Slovenia, that soaring electricity prices ""are now exposing the limitations of our current electricity market design."" ""It was developed for different circumstances,"" von der Leyen said. ""That is why we are now working on an emergency intervention and a structural reform of the electricity market."" The continent's electricity market is underpinned by a ""merit order"" system in which the power stations offering the cheapest electricity are tapped first, but prices are determined by the last and most expensive power stations to be tapped - at present, those using gas, whose price has risen sharply following cuts in supplies by Russia to several European countries amid the war in Ukraine. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, visiting Prague on Monday, said that the question of how the European electricity market can be redesigned ""so that we no longer have to bear these high prices we are currently seeing"" took up much of his meeting with Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala, whose country currently holds the EU's rotating presidency. He said that ""we will act together quickly."" ""It is necessary for us to make structural changes that contribute to prices sinking again quickly and there being a sufficient offer"" of electricity, Scholz said at a news conference. He added that ""there is great readiness to change something, and that seems to me to be very much mutual among the heads of state and government in Europe.""

Speaking earlier in Berlin, a German economy ministry spokeswoman said that the idea is to keep the principle of the ""merit order"" system, ""but do away with the negative effects the merit order has, so that the high gas prices can no longer impact immediately and automatically on electricity prices."" The aim is for customers to benefit from cheaper production prices for renewable energy, for example, spokeswoman Beate Baron said. ___ Follow AP´s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine Ursula von der Leyen, center, sits between Slovenian President Borut Pahor, left and Slovenia Prime Minister Robert Golob at the Bled Strategic Forum in Bled, Slovenia, Monday, Aug. 29, 2022.

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-11157305/Russian-journalist-charged-donating-16-Navalny-group.html,2022-08-29,Russian journalist charged for donating $16 to Navalny group,"An independent Russian journalist has been charged with funding an extremist organization over donating a small amount of money to a foundation started by imprisoned Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny, Russian media reported Monday. It is the first publicly known criminal prosecution for donating to Navalny's organizations since they were declared extremist and outlawed last summer - an apparently new tactic that Russian authorities have chosen to deepen their crackdown on dissent. Radio Liberty cited Andrei Zayakin's colleagues as saying he was arrested in his Moscow apartment Sunday and brought before a court Monday. If convicted, he faces up to eight years in prison. According to the Mass Media Defense Center, a rights group that's helping defend Zayakin, the investigators accuse the journalist of donating 1,000 rubles (about $16) to Navalny's Foundation for Fighting Corruption. Zayakin, who wrote for the independent Russian newspaper Novaya Gazeta and other publications, spent the night in a police holding cell. On Monday, a court approved investigators' request to impose a curfew on him between 8 p.m. and 8 a.m., bar him from using the internet and phone and from communicating with other people implicated in the case, although it was not immediately clear if there were any. Russian authorities have increasingly targeted critics and opponents in the last few years, especially after the country began what it calls its ""special military operation"" in Ukraine on Feb. 24. Navalny is in prison on a variety of charges that he calls politically motivated and continues to speak out via social media. A Russian court last year branded his Foundation for Fighting Corruption, as well as his network of regional offices, as extremist and banned its work in Russia. Zayakin, who holds a degree in math and physics, co-founded a widely-known project called Dissernet, which seeks to expose corruption and plagiarism in Russian science by studying doctoral theses - especially those written by government officials. Also Monday, Russian authorities detained another prominent Kremlin critic, Leonid Gozman, on charges of publicly comparing the Soviet Union with Nazi Germany. Gozman faces a fine or a 15-day administrative arrest."

In a wide-ranging speech at Charles University in Prague, Scholz said the EU must make itself ""fit"" for future enlargement from 27 to 30 - or even 36 - nations by taking more decisions by majority vote, rather than requiring unanimity on all issues that has in the past allowed individual member states to veto key decisions. ""We have to remember that swearing allegiance to the principle of unanimity only works for as long as the pressure to act is low,"" Scholz said, arguing that Russia's invasion of Ukraine was a wake-up call for the EU to change the way it takes decisions. Scholz suggested allowing majority decisions on pressing issues such as sanctions or human rights policy, with those unwilling to explicitly back a vote having the option to abstain without blocking unanimity. The German leader also backed calls to reconsider the composition of the European Parliament, which currently has 751 deputies, to prevent it becoming ""bloated"" through future expansion. A similar reform of the way each member state is represented in the bloc's executive Commission could see commissioners share responsibility in certain areas, he said. With Europe lagging behind global rivals when it comes to digitalization and space exploration, Scholz said the EU could become a global leader in the transition to a greener economy that would also help it become less dependent on foreign energy suppliers. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz delivers a speech at the Charles University in Prague, Czech Republic, Monday, Aug. 29, 2022. (AP Photo/Petr David Josek) In his address, Scholz repeatedly cited the threat posed to the EU by Russia under its authoritarian president, warning that ""any disunity among us, any weakness, is grist to (Vladimir) Putin´s mill."" ""We must close ranks, resolve old conflicts and find new solutions,"" he said, noting that the bloc needs to overcome long-running tensions among its members on the issues of migration and fiscal policy. Scholz's speech echoed proposals made in recent months by French President Emmanuel Macron. But it is likely to be received warily by smaller countries that fear reforming the EU's unwieldy decision-making processes to allow more votes to pass with two-third majorities could see their concerns ignored. Tensions have also flared in recent years between the European Commission and the governments of Hungary and Poland, with Brussels accusing those countries of breaching the bloc's fundamental values and the principle of rule of law. Scholz said the EU ""cannot stand by when the principles of due process are violated and democratic oversight is dismantled,"" but appealed for unity in the face of mounting pressure from outside. ""When, if not now, will we overcome the differences that have hobbled and divided us for years?"" he asked. Germany, which until recently lagged behind other NATO countries when it came to military spending, plans to invest heavily in its air defense in the coming years, said Scholz. The system will be designed so that its European neighbors can join, he said. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz arrives at the Charles University in Prague, Czech Republic, Monday, Aug. 29, 2022.

The Russian Defense Ministry said that the Vostok 2022 (East 2022) exercise will be held Sept. 1-7 in various locations in Russia´s Far East and the Sea of Japan and involve more than 50,000 troops, over 5,000 weapons units, including 140 aircraft and 60 warships. The ministry released a video of Chinese troops arriving in Russa in preparation for the exercise. The drills will be conducted at seven firing ranges in far eastern Russia and will engage troops from several ex-Soviet nations, China, India, Laos, Mongolia, Nicaragua and Syria. The ministry said that units of Russian Airborne troops, long-range bombers and military cargo planes will take part in the drills along with other forces. While first announcing the exercise last month, the Russian military emphasized that it´s part of planned combat training that is continuing despite Moscow´s military action in Ukraine. It hasn´t disclosed the number of troops engaged in what the Kremlin calls the ""special military operation"" there. In this handout photo taken from video released by Russian Defense Ministry Press Service on Monday, Aug. 29, 2022, Chinese soldiers arrive to the Grodekovo railway station to participate in war games drills, in Grodekovo, Primorsky Krai, Russia. Russia said Monday it will launch sweeping war games drills in the country's east that will involve forces from China - a show of increasingly close military ties between Moscow and Beijing amid tensions with the West over the Kremlin's action in Ukraine. (Russian Defense Ministry Press Service via AP) The ministry noted that as part of the maneuvers, the Russian and Chinese navies in the Sea of Japan will ""practice joint action to protect sea communications, areas of marine economic activity and support for ground troops in littoral areas."" Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Alexander Fomin specified that the naval drills would take part in the northern and central part of the Sea of Japan. ""The exercise isn´t directed against any specific countries or military alliances and is purely defensive,"" Fomin said at a meeting with foreign military attaches. The drills reflect increasing defense ties between Moscow and Beijing, which have grown stronger since Russia sent its troops into Ukraine on Feb. 24. China has pointedly refused to criticize Russia´s action, blaming the U.S. and NATO for provoking Moscow, and has blasted punishing sanctions imposed on Moscow. Russia, in turn, has strongly backed China amid the tensions with the U.S. that followed a recent visit to Taiwan by U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Speaking earlier this month, Russian President Vladimir Putin drew parallels between U.S. support for Ukraine and Pelosi´s trip to Taiwan, charging that both were part of alleged American efforts to foment global instability. Russia and China have held a series of joint war games in recent years, including naval drills and patrols by long-range bombers over the Sea of Japan and the East China Sea. Last year, Russian troops for the first time deployed to Chinese territory for joint maneuvers. Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping have developed strong personal ties to bolster a ""strategic partnership"" between the former Communist rivals as both Moscow and Beijing face increasing tensions with the West. Even though Moscow and Beijing in the past rejected the possibility of forging a military alliance, Putin has said that such a prospect can´t be ruled out. He also has noted that Russia has been sharing highly sensitive military technologies with China that helped significantly bolster its defense capability. While first announcing the drills last month, the Russian Defense Ministry emphasized that it´s part of planned combat training that is continuing despite Moscow´s military action in Ukraine.

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-11156253/Russia-identifies-2nd-suspect-death-nationalist-Dugina.html,2022-08-29,Russia identifies 2nd suspect in death of nationalist Dugina,"Russia´s top security agency on Monday identified a second Ukrainian that it alleged was involved in the killing of the daughter of a Russian nationalist ideologue. Russia´s Federal Security Service (FSB), the main KGB successor agency, said that Ukrainian national Bogdan Tsyganenko helped prepare the killing of Darya Dugina, the daughter of Alexander Dugin, who was described by some in the West as ""Putin´s brain."" The FSB charged that Tsyganenko provided the main suspect, Natalya Vovk, with a fake ID and fake license plates, and helped her assemble an explosive device that was planted in Dugina´s car. Tsyganenko, 44, arrived in Russia via Estonia on July 30 and left the country the day before the killing, the FSB said. Dugina, a 29-year-old commentator with a nationalist Russian TV channel, died when a remotely controlled explosive device planted in her SUV blew up on the night of Aug. 20 as she was driving on the outskirts of Moscow, ripping the vehicle apart and killing her on the spot, authorities said. Both she and her father, who is a philosopher, writer and political theorist, ardently supported Russian President Vladimir Putin´s decision to send troops into Ukraine. The FSB said Dugina´s killing was ""prepared and perpetrated by the Ukrainian special services"" and accused Vovk of carrying out the killing and then fleeing to Estonia. Vovk, according to the FSB, arrived in Russia in July with her 12-year-old daughter and rented an apartment in the building where Dugina lived in order to shadow her. The agency alleged that Vovk and her daughter were at a nationalist festival that Dugin and his daughter attended just before the killing. The FSB said Vovk used a license plate for Ukraine´s Russian-backed separatist Donetsk region to enter Russia and a Kazakhstan plate in Moscow before switching to a Ukrainian one to cross into Estonia. It released video and photos of the suspect from surveillance cameras at the border crossings, while driving the car in Moscow and at the entrance to the Moscow apartment building. The agency said Monday that Tsyganenko provided Vovk with a Kazakh license plate and Kazakh ID documents belonging to a real person named Yulia Zaiko. It didn't offer any details as to how Vovk obtained other license plates and whether those were fake, too. Kyiv has vehemently denied any involvement in Dugina's death. Estonian authorities said they have not received any formal requests or inquiries from Russia regarding Vovk."

The stakes couldn't be higher for the International Atomic Energy Agency experts who will visit the plant in a country where the 1986 Chernobyl disaster spewed radiation throughout the region, shocking the world and intensifying a global push away from nuclear energy. ""Without an exaggeration, this mission will be the hardest in the history of IAEA,"" Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said. Underscoring the urgency, Ukraine and Russia again accused each other of shelling the wider region around the nuclear power plant, Europe's largest, which was briefly knocked offline last week. The dangers are so high that officials have begun handing out anti-radiation iodine tablets to nearby residents. To avoid a disaster, IAEA Director-General Rafael Grossi has sought access for months to the Zaporizhzhia plant, which Russian forces have occupied since the early days of the six-month-old war. Ukrainian nuclear workers have been operating the plant. ""The day has come,"" Grossi tweeted Monday, adding that the Vienna-based IAEA´s ""Support and Assistance Mission ... is now on its way.""

A team from the U.N. nuclear watchdog on Monday started its journey to the Zaporizhzhia atomic power plant at the heart of fighting in Ukraine, a long-awaited mission to inspect crucial safety systems that the world hopes will help avoid a catastrophe. (Satellite image ©2022 Maxar Technologies via AP) Ukraine's Foreign Ministry spokesman said the team, which Grossi heads, was scheduled to arrive in Kyiv on Monday. In April, Grossi had headed an IAEA mission to Chernobyl, which Russian forces occupied earlier in the war. The IAEA said that its team will ""undertake urgent safeguards activities,"" assess damage, determine the functionality of the plant's safety and security systems and evaluate the control room staff's working conditions. Ukraine's nuclear energy agency, Energoatom, warned Monday of Russian attempts to cover up their military use of the plant. ""The occupiers, preparing for the arrival of the IAEA mission, increased pressure on the personnel ... to prevent them from disclosing evidence of the occupiers´ crimes at the plant and its use as a military base,"" Energoatom said, adding that four plant workers were wounded in Russian shelling of the city where they live. Ukraine accused Russia of new rocket and artillery strikes at or near the plant, intensifying fears that the fighting could cause a massive radiation leak. So far, radiation levels at the facility, which has six reactors, have been reported to be normal. Ukraine has alleged that Russia is essentially holding the plant hostage, storing weapons there and launching attacks from around it, while Moscow accuses Ukraine of recklessly firing on the facility. World leaders have called on the Russians to demilitarize the plant. Satellite images provided by Maxar Technologies on Monday showed armored personnel carriers on a road near the reactors, damage to a building's roof also near the reactors, and brush fires burning nearby. Ukraine reported more Russian shelling in Nikopol, across the Dnieper River from the nuclear power plant, with one person killed and five wounded. Relentless shelling has hit the city for weeks. In Enerhodar, a few kilometers from the plant, the city´s Ukrainian mayor, Dmytro Orlov, blamed Russian shelling for wounding at least 10 residents. Kuleba, Ukraine's foreign minister, said in Stockholm that he expects the IAEA mission to produce ""a clear statement of facts, of violation of all nuclear, of nuclear safety protocols."" He added, ""We know that Russia is putting not only Ukraine, but also the entire world at threat at the risk of nuclear accident."" In Moscow, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russia will ensure the IAEA mission's security, and he called on other countries to ""raise pressure on the Ukrainian side to force it to stop threatening the European continent by shelling the territory of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant and surrounding areas."" Over the weekend, Energoatom painted an ominous picture of the threats at the plant by issuing a map forecasting where radiation could spread if a leak occurred. Elsewhere on the battlefield, the Ukraine military claimed it had breached Russia´s first line of defense near Kherson just north of the Crimea, the peninsula that Russia annexed from Ukraine in 2014. Such an advance would represent a strategic breakthrough - if confirmed. Kherson is the biggest Ukrainian city that the Russians now occupy, and reports about Ukrainian forces preparing for a counteroffensive in the region have circulated for weeks. For its part, Russia's Defense Ministry said its forces had inflicted heavy personnel and military equipment losses on Ukrainian troops trying to attack in three directions in Ukraine's southern Kherson and Mykoaiv regions, the state news agency Tass reported. Residents reported explosions Monday at a Kherson-area bridge over the Dnieper River that is a critical Russian supply line, and Russian news reports spoke of air defense systems activating repeatedly in the city, with nighttime explosions in the sky Monday night. Russian-installed officials, citing Ukrainian rocket strikes, announced the evacuation of residents of nearby Nova Kakhovka - a city that Kyiv´s forces frequently target - from their workplaces to bomb shelters on Monday. In another Kherson region city, Berislav, Russian news agencies reported that Ukrainian shelling had damaged a church, a school and other buildings. But in a war rife with claims and counterclaims that are hard to verify independently, the Moscow-appointed regional leader of Crimea, Sergei Aksyonov, dismissed the Ukrainian assertion of an offensive in the Kherson region as false. He said Ukrainian forces have suffered heavy losses in the area. And Ukraine´s presidential adviser, Mykhailo Podolyak, cautioned against ""super-sensational announcements"" about a counteroffensive. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy reacted to speculation about whether his forces had launched a major counteroffensive in southern Ukraine by asking in his nightly video address Monday, ""Anyone want to know what our plans are? You won´t hear specifics from any truly responsible person. Because this is war."" In the eastern Donetsk region, eight civilians were reported killed and seven wounded. Russian forces struck the cities of Sloviansk and Kostyantynivka overnight and the region's Ukrainian governor, Pavlo Kyrylenko, urged residents to evacuate immediately. ___ Andrew Katell contributed to this report from New York. ___ Follow AP´s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine This satellite image provided by Maxar Technologies shows bush fires outside of the main power plant facilities at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in Russian occupied Ukraine, Monday Aug. 29, 2022.

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-11154041/Cities-near-Ukrainian-nuclear-plant-shelled.html,2022-08-28,"Russia, Ukraine trade claims of nuclear plant attacks","Russia and Ukraine traded claims of rocket and artillery strikes at or near Europe's largest nuclear power plant on Sunday, intensifying fears that the fighting could cause a massive radiation leak. Ukraine's atomic energy agency painted an ominous picture of the threat Sunday by issuing a map forecasting where radiation could spread from the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, which Russian forces have controlled since soon after the war began. Attacks were reported over the weekend not only in Russian-controlled territory adjacent to the plant along the left bank of the Dnieper River, but along the Ukraine-controlled right bank, including the cities of Nikopol and Marhanets, each about 10 kilometers (six miles) from the facility. Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov said Sunday that Ukrainian forces had attacked the plant twice over the past day, and that shells fell near buildings storing reactor fuel and radioactive waste. ""One projectile fell in the area of the sixth power unit, and the other five in front of the sixth unit pumping station, which provides cooling for this reactor,"" Konashenkov said, adding that radiation levels were normal. The U.N.'s International Atomic Energy Agency also reported Sunday that radiation levels were normal, that two of the Zaporizhzhia plant's six reactors were operating and that while no complete assessment had yet been made, recent fighting had damaged a water pipeline, since repaired. Ukrainian flags to honor soldiers killed fighting Russian troops, are placed in a garden in Kiev's Independence Square, Ukraine, Sunday, Aug. 28, 2022. (AP Photo/Emilio Morenatti) In another apparent attack Sunday, Russian forces shot down an armed Ukrainian drone targeting one of the Zaporizhzhia plant's spent fuel storage sites, a local official said. Vladimir Rogov, a Russian-installed regional official, said on the Telegram messaging app that the drone crashed onto a building's roof, not causing any significant damage or injuring anyone. Nearby, heavy firing during the night left parts of Nikopol without electricity, said Valentyn Reznichenko, the Dnipropetrovsk region's governor. Rocket strikes damaged a dozen residences in Marhanets, according to Yevhen Yevtushenko, the administration head for the district that includes the city of about 45,000. The city of Zaporizhzhia, about 40 kilometers (25 miles) up the Dnieper River from the nuclear plant, also came under Russian fire, damaging dozens of apartment buildings and homes and wounding two people, city council member Anatoliy Kurtev said. Russian forces struck a Zaporizhzhia repair shop for Ukrainian air force helicopters, Konashenkov said. Neither side's claims could be independently verified. Downriver from the nuclear plant, Ukrainian rockets hit the Kakhovka hydroelectric plant and adjacent city three times on Sunday, said Vladimir Leontyev, the head of the Russia-installed local administration. The plant's dam is a major roadway across the river and a potentially key Russian supply route. The dam forms a reservoir that provides water for the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant. The radiation map Ukraine's nuclear agency Energoatom issued showed that based on wind forecasts for Monday, a nuclear cloud could spread across southern Ukraine and southwestern Russia. Release of the map may have been meant to warn that if Russian forces were responsible for a radiation leak, their own country would suffer. In the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear power plant accident, the world's worst atomic energy catastrophe, radiation spread from Ukraine to several neighboring countries. Authorities last week began distributing iodine tablets to residents who live near the Zaporizhzhia plant in case of radiation exposure. Much of the concern centers on the cooling systems for the plant´s nuclear reactors. The systems require electricity, and the plant was temporarily knocked offline Thursday because of what officials said was fire damage to a transmission line. A cooling system failure could cause a nuclear meltdown. Periodic shelling has damaged the power station´s infrastructure, Energoatom, said Saturday. ""There are risks of hydrogen leakage and sputtering of radioactive substances, and the fire hazard is high,"" it said. The IAEA has tried to work out an agreement with Ukrainian and Russian authorities to send a team to inspect and secure the plant, but it remained unclear when the visit might take place. In eastern Ukraine, where Russian and separatist forces are trying to take control, shelling hit the large and strategically significant cities of Kramatorsk and Sloviansk, with no casualties reported, said Pavlo Kyrylenko, the Donetsk region's governor. Konashenkov said Russian missile strikes killed 250 Ukrainian soldiers and reservists in and near Sloviansk. Ukrainian officials didn't comment on the claim, in keeping with their policy of not discussing losses. Sloviansk resident Kostiantyn Daineko told The Associated Press that he was falling asleep when an explosion blew out his apartment windows. ""I opened my eyes and saw how the window frame was flying over me, the frame and pieces of broken glass,"" he said. Russian and separatist forces hold much of the Donetsk region, one of two Russia has recognized as sovereign states. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy vowed again Sunday to re-take the separatist areas. ""The invaders brought degradation and death and they believe that they are there forever,"" Zelenskyy said Sunday in his nightly video address. ""But it´s a temporary thing for them.

Day and night, he raced around his hometown of Mariupol, rescuing those wounded by the Russian bombs and shells that pummeled the southern Ukrainian city. When he finally escaped Mariupol - whose residents endured some of the worst suffering of the war during a nearly three-month siege - he still did not rest. Instead, he joined an organization that sends medics to the front lines in eastern Ukraine, where the fighting is currently concentrated. ""Me before Mariupol and me after what happened: It's two different people,"" the skinny, fresh-faced 24-year-old said during a recent interview with The Associated Press in Kharkiv, another city that has endured intense bombardment. ""If I had not survived Mariupol, I would not have gone to work as a paramedic now. I wouldn´t have had enough courage,"" explained Chornobryvets, who is simply called ""Mariupol"" on the battlefield and now wears a patch that bears the symbol of the port city, a yellow anchor, on his camouflage uniform. In fact, he could see no other way of making sense of the horrors he witnessed in a place that became a worldwide symbol of Ukrainian resistance to Russia's invasion. Residents suffered relentless bombardment, many trapped without food, water, heat or electricity. ""It was like going back to the Stone Age,"" Chornobryvets said. ""There was looting, constant shelling, planes, aerial bombardment. People around us were losing their minds, but we got on with our work.""

(AP Photo/Evgeniy Maloletka) While many hid in basements or bomb shelters, Chornobryvets said he never did. He stayed above ground to tend to the wounded - all while risking his own life. He finally fled on March 18 - his birthday - still in his red paramedic's overalls. His tireless efforts were publicly praised by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, when the leader accepted an award in May from the Atlantic Council, the Washington-based think tank, on behalf of the Ukrainian people. Chornobryvets said that his new work on the front and what he did in Mariupol were almost indistinguishable: ""Same wounds, only I´m wearing a different uniform."" In footage from July, he and his fellow medics can be seen rushing toward a soldier hit by Russian fire. They tightened a tourniquet around the man´s right thigh, and then carefully tended to a gaping wounds in an arm and a leg, where the bone was exposed. He has a year left of college to finish - but resists making plans for the future. Until the war is won, he has vowed to stay on the battlefield. ""Medicine is my life, and my duty is to save people,"" said Chornobryvets. He dreams of one day returning to Mariupol, which fell to the Russians in May, but tries not to think about it too much because it's too painful. ""My soul will calm down when I enter Mariupol - and the Ukrainian flag is flying over it,"" he said. ___ Follow AP coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine ___ Associated Press journalists Vasilisa Stepnenko and Evgeniy Maloletka in Kharkiv contributed.

The comments by Josep Borell come after a flurry of international diplomatic efforts to defuse concerns that the problems could escalate further amid the war in Ukraine and Serbia's close ties with Russia. Kosovo declared independence from Serbia in 2008, which Belgrade does not recognize. Tensions soared late last month when Kosovo´s government declared that Serb-issued identity documents and vehicle license plates would no longer be valid in Kosovo´s territory, just as Kosovo-issued ones are not valid in Serbia. Serbia in the past years required Kosovo ID holders to acquire special passes when traveling through Serbia to show it does not recognize Kosovo's independence. Kosovo said it was responding with reciprocity to Serbia. But Kosovo Serbs reacted furiously, blocking roads in the Serb-dominated north. Belgrade accused Kosovo of pressuring minority Serbs in the north, who largely reject Kosovo-issued documents in defiance of Kosovo's statehood and hold Serbian ones. In the past two weeks, EU officials mediated a meeting between Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic and Kosovo Prime Minister Albin Kurti in Brussels, and U.S. and EU envoys traveled to the region to try to resolve the issue. In this photo provided by the Serbian Presidential Press Service, Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic, right, speaks with European Union envoy Miroslav Lajcak in Belgrade, Serbia, Thursday, Aug. 25, 2022. Tensions between Serbia and Kosovo soared anew late last month when Kosovo's government declared that Serb-issued identity documents and vehicle license plates would no longer be valid in Kosovo's territory, as Kosovo-issued ones are not valid in Serbia. (Serbian Presidential Press Service via AP) ""We have a deal,"" Borrell said on Twitter. ""Serbia agreed to abolish entry/exit documents for Kosovo ID holders and Kosovo agreed to not introduce them for Serbian ID holders."" ""Kosovo Serbs, as well as all other citizens, will be able to travel freely between Kosovo & Serbia using their ID cards,"" he added. Kosovo President Vlosa Osmani said on Facebook that the deal meant ""reciprocity and equality."" ""Freedom of movement is the foundation of democratic societies and European values,"" she said, adding that Kosovo will continue to strive for ""mutual recognition."" Earlier Saturday, Vucic told reporters that if the ID deal is reached, Serbia will issue a ""general disclaimer"" on the boundary, saying the use of Kosovo ID cards is enabled for ""practical reasons and freedom of movement,"" and does not mean Serbia's recognition of Kosovo or its future status. However, he said the Serbian car registration plates that many Kosovo Serbs still use remains an unresolved issue. Kosovo´s independence has been recognized by Washington and most EU countries, while Serbia has relied on support from Moscow and China for its bid to retain the former province. Belgrade lost control over Kosovo in 1999 after NATO bombed the country to stop its brutal crackdown against ethnic Albanian separatist rebels. For several years, the EU has mediated negotiations between Kosovo and Serbia, seeking to normalize their relations and move forward their efforts to join the European Union. NATO peacekeepers have stepped up their presence in northern Kosovo in response to the increased tensions."

(""God is great!""), holding their rifles in the air before being handed military ID cards that are issued to volunteers. Ukrainian officials say the Chechen battalion currently numbers several hundred who fight alongside the country´s military but are not formally under the national command.

Trainers include veterans of wars in Chechnya that ended in 2009, some joining up in Ukraine after the fighting against Russia-backed separatists started in Ukraine in 2014. Tor, a volunteer who asked only to be identified by his battlefield nickname, said he sees no difference between the two conflicts. ""People have to understand we don´t have a choice,"" he said speaking in English and with his face covered. ""If they (Russian forces) win this war, they will continue. They never stop. I don´t know. The Baltic countries will be next, or Georgia or Kazakhstan. Putin openly, absolutely, says he wants to rebuild the Soviet empire."" Russia launched two wars to prevent Chechnya, a mostly Muslim province, from gaining independence after the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union. The first conflict erupted in 1994. The second Chechen war began in 1999 and culminated in a siege by Russian troops of Grozny, the Chechen capital, which was devastated by heavy Russian bombardment. After years of battling an insurgency, Russian officials declared the conflict in Chechnya over in 2017. Muslim Madiev, a veteran fighter of the Chechen conflicts, identified himself as an adviser to the volunteer battalion in Ukraine. He joined the soldiers Saturday in shooting practice, taking aim at a plastic bottle held up on a stick. Bullet casings flew from his automatic rifle onto a field already littered with bullets, shotgun cartridges and cardboard target sheets. ""We´re going to win this war. The whole world is already standing up for us,"" he says, speaking in Russian. ""We were the only ones who fought for ourselves (in Chechnya). No one stood with us. But now the whole world is behind Ukraine. We must win, we must win,"" he declared. ___ Follow AP´s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine Volunteer soldiers attend a training outside Kyiv, Ukraine, Saturday, Aug. 27, 2022.

The vow of protection by NATO allies comes as Russia's war against Ukraine enters its seventh month. It is to last until Slovakia receives new F-16s from the United States, something expected to happen in 2024. Under the agreement, Poland and Czechia are providing the necessary forces to quickly react in case of violations of Slovakia´s airspace. Slovakia has a border with Ukraine, which Russia invaded in February. The agreement was signed at a Slovak airbase by defense ministers Jana Cernochova of Czechia, Mariusz Blaszczak of Poland and Jaroslav Nad of Slovakia. ""In the immediate proximity of our region where we live came a war, and all of us who are standing here today either have experience with fascism or communism, and we really value the freedom that we gained after 1989,"" Cernochova said at a news conference alongside her Slovak and Polish counterparts. Blaszczak said under the agreement, a pair of Polish F-16 fighter jets would begin patrolling Slovakia's air space starting Sept. 1. He called the effort a way for the neighbors to ""deter a possible aggressor."" Slovak Air Force MiG-29s fly over an airport during an airshow in Malacky, Slovakia, Saturday, Aug. 27, 2022.

(AP Photo/Petr David Josek) Slovakia has a fleet of 11 MiG-29 jets, and last month Nad said Slovakia may consider donating them to Ukraine under certain conditions. Asked by a reporter Saturday about whether the jets might go to Ukraine, Nad said Slovakia was in talks with Ukraine and its European Union allies about how best to help. But he said he could not say what that help might look like yet. Since the start of the Russian invasion on Feb. 24, Ukraine has urged Western allies to provide it with warplanes to challenge Russia´s air superiority. Poland, Czechia and Slovakia belong to a region that was under Moscow's control during the decades of the Cold War. Many people here worry that if Russia isn't stopped in Ukraine, Moscow's renewed imperial ambitions could target them too.

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-11151931/Ukraine-Russia-fires-cities-not-far-nuclear-plant.html,2022-08-27,"Ukraine, Russia trade more blame on threats to nuclear plant","Fears about the potential for a radiation leak at Europe's largest nuclear power plant persisted Saturday as both sides traded blame for nearby shelling. Ukraine said Russian forces fired on areas just across the river from the plant and Russia claimed Ukrainian shells hit a building where nuclear fuel is stored. Authorities were distributing iodine tablets to residents who live near the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant in case of radiation exposure, which can cause health problems. Much of the concern centers on the cooling systems for the plant's nuclear reactors. The systems require power to run, and the plant was temporarily knocked offline Thursday because of what officials said was fire damage to a transmission line. A cooling system failure could cause a nuclear meltdown. Russian forces occupied the nuclear plant complex early in the 6-month-old war, but local Ukrainian workers have kept it running. The Ukrainian and Russian governments have repeatedly accused the other of shelling the complex and nearby areas, raising fears of a possible catastrophe. Periodic shelling has damaged the power station's infrastructure, Ukraine´s nuclear power operator, Energoatom, said Saturday. ""There are risks of hydrogen leakage and sputtering of radioactive substances, and the fire hazard is high,"" it said. The governor of Ukraine´s Dnipropetrovsk region, Valentyn Reznichenko, said Saturday that Russian Grad missiles and artillery shells hit the cities of Nikopol and Marhanets, each located 10 kilometers (6 miles) across the Dnieper River from the plant. A view of a crater from a night Russian rocket attack, near to damaged buildings in downtown Kharkiv, Ukraine, Saturday, Aug. 27, 2022. (AP Photo/Andrii Marienko) But Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov said Ukrainian forces had fired on the plant from Marhanets. Over the past day, 17 Ukrainian shells hit the plant, with four striking the roof of a building that stores nuclear fuel, he said. It was not immediately possible to verify either account. The U.N.`s atomic energy agency has tried to work out an agreement to send a team in to inspect and help secure the plant. Officials said preparations for the visit were underway, but it remained unclear when it might take place. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said it was essential for International Atomic Energy Agency representatives to get to the plant as soon as possible and to help keep it ""under permanent Ukrainian control."" ""The situation remains precarious and dangerous,"" Zelenskyy said Friday in his nightly address. ""Any repetition of (Thursday's) events, i.e., any disconnection of the station from the grid or any actions by Russia that could trigger the shut down of the reactors, will once again put the station one step away from disaster."" Ukraine has claimed Russia is using the power plant as a shield by storing weapons there and launching attacks from around it. Moscow, for its part, accuses Ukraine of firing on the nuclear complex. The dispute over the plant led Russia late Friday to block agreement on the final document of the four-week-long review of the U.N. treaty that is considered the cornerstone of nuclear disarmament. The draft document of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty review conference criticized Russia's takeover of the Zaporizhzhia plant. The deputy head of Russia's delegation said the conference became ""a political hostage"" to countries that were trying ""to settle scores with Russia by raising issues that are not directly related to the treaty."" Elsewhere in Ukraine, one person was killed and another wounded in Russian firing in the Mykolaiv region, local government officials said. Mykolaiv city is an important Black Sea port and shipbuilding center. The governor of the eastern Donetsk region, Pavlo Kyrylenko, said Saturday that two people were killed in Russian firing on the city of Bakhmut, a significant target for Russian and separatist forces seeking to take control of the parts of the region they do not already hold. The British government said Saturday that it was giving Ukraine underwater drones and training sailors to use them to clear mines from the ravaged country's coastline. Mines laid in the Black Sea during the war have hampered seaborne exports of Ukrainian grain to world markets, although an agreement reached in July has allowed shipments to resume along a single corridor. More than 1 million metric tons of Ukrainian foodstuffs have been shipped since the start of August under the Black Sea grain deal, the United Nations said Saturday. The flow of grain under deal has driven down prices, reduced the risk of food insecurity and allowed the World Food Program to restart wheat purchases from Ukraine for drought-hit countries such as Ethiopia and Yemen. ___ Follow AP's coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine A man removes broken glass from a window's frame after the night Russian rocket attack in downtown Kharkiv, Ukraine, Saturday, Aug. 27, 2022.

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-11151697/Conference-Japanese-African-economic-cooperation-begin.html,2022-08-27,Tunisia hosts Japanese-African economic cooperation meeting,"African heads of state, representatives of international organizations and private business leaders gathered in Tunisia on Saturday for the Tokyo International Conference on African Development, a triennial event launched by Japan to promote growth and security in Africa. Economic fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic, a food crisis worsened by Russia's war in Ukraine, and climate change are among the challenges facing many African countries expected to define the two-day conference. Tensions among African countries also weighed on the meeting: On Friday, Morocco announced a boycott of the event and recalled its ambassador to Tunisia to protest the inclusion of a representative of the Polisario Front movement fighting for independence for Western Sahara. The conference comes as Russia and China have sought to increase their economic and other influence in Africa. While 30 African heads of state and government attended the event in Tunis, Tunisia's capital, many key talks are being held remotely, including those involving Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, who tested positive for COVID-19 ahead of the summit. The Japanese government created and hosted the first TICAD summit in 1993. The conferences now are co-organized with the United Nations, the African Union and the World Bank. The summits have generated 26 development projects in 20 African countries.

(Fethi Belaid/Pool Photo via AP) This year, discussion around an increase of Japanese investments in Africa is anticipated, with particular focus on supporting start-ups and food security initiatives. Japan has said it plans to provide assistance for the production of rice, alongside a promised $130 million in food aid. Africa Center for Strategic Studies, an academic institution of the U.S. Defense Department, compared the conference's format to the annual World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, ""where government, business, and civil society leaders participate on an equal basis."" However, this weekend's summit has sparked controversy in Tunis, which faces its own acute economic crisis, including a recent spike in food and gasoline shortages. Critics have spoken out about organizers´ alleged ""white-washing"" of the city, which has seen cleaner streets and infrastructure improvements in preparation for the conference summit. One local commentator said the North African capital looked like it had applied makeup to impress participants. Meanwhile, the journalists' union in Tunisia issued a statement Friday condemning restrictions on reporting and information around the summit. Morocco's complaint stemmed from Tunisia inviting the Polisario Front leader to attend. Morocco annexed Western Sahara from Spain in 1975, and the Polisario Front fought to make it an independent state until a 1991 cease-fire. It's a highly sensitive issue in Morocco, which seeks international recognition for its authority over Western Sahara. ""The welcome given by the Tunisian head of state to the leader of the separatist militia is a serious and unprecedented act, which deeply hurts the feelings of the Moroccan people,"" Morocco's Foreign Ministry said in a statement. Morocco announced its withdrawal from the conference and the recall of its ambassador for consultations. But the ministry said the decision does not ""call into question the commitment of the Kingdom of Morocco to the interests of Africa."" ___ Tarik El-Barakah in Rabat, Morocco contributed. ___ Follow all of AP's coverage of Africa: https://apnews.com/hub/africa Tunisia's President Kais Saied, right, and Japan's Foreign Minister Yoshimasa Hayashi pose for a photo during the eighth Tokyo International Conference on African Development (TICAD) in Tunisia's capital Tunis on Saturday, Aug. 27, 2022.

During a visit to Canada's north, Stoltenberg said the shortest path to North America for Russian missiles and bombers is over the North Pole. He said Russia has set up a new Arctic Command and has opened hundreds of new and former Soviet-era Arctic military sites, including airfields and deep-water ports. ""We see a significant Russian military build-up with new bases, new weapons systems, and also using the High North as a test bed for their most advanced weapons, including hypersonic missiles,"" Stoltenberg said at a Canadian military base in Cold Lake, Alberta. Stoltenberg also noted China has declared itself a ""near Arctic"" state. He said Beijing plans to build the world´s largest icebreaker and is spending tens of billions of dollars on energy, infrastructure, and research projects in the north. ""Beijing and Moscow have also pledged to intensify practical cooperation in the Arctic. This forms part of a deepening strategic partnership that challenges our values and interests,"" Stoltenberg said. He also noted climate change is making the Arctic more accessible for militaries and welcomed Canada's recent announcement that it will bolster its spending on defense.

Those include promises to allocate billions of dollars for new military equipment and capabilities, including plans to purchase new fighter jets and modernize North America´s aging NORAD early-warning system with Washington. ""The ill-fated, unjustifiable decision of Russia to upend nearly 70 years of peace and stability of a rules-based order by invading a peaceful neighbor, has changed the way we need to look at the Arctic,"" Trudeau said, alluding to the Russian attack on Ukraine.

The Adriatic Sea state, once considered a strong Russian ally, in 2017 joined NATO despite strong opposition from Moscow.

Russian bombs fall on Ukraine. China is flexing its military muscle in the Taiwan Strait. Migrants die repeatedly at sea as smugglers' boats sink. The Earth warms, creating drought, collapsing glaciers and triggering violent storms. The pandemic lingers. ""We are talking about many, many things. We are talking about immigrants, about deaths, about the war, about many, many issues,´´ Ai told The Associated Press in Venice on Friday. He stands by his 9-meter (29.5-foot), nearly 3-ton black glass sculpture, which is suspended over the central nave of the deconsecrated church of San Giorgio Maggiore, located opposite Venice's St. Mark´s Square. Titled ""The Human Comedy: Memento Mori,"" the sculpture is the centerpiece of an Ai exhibit at the church that opens Sunday. The huge hanging artwork is part chandelier, part ossuary, with intricately hung molded glass skeletons and skulls, both human and animal, balanced with glass-blown human organs and scattered likenesses of the Twitter bird logo and surveillance cameras, hinting at the darker side of technology. ""We see the environment completely disappearing, being destroyed by humans´ effort ... and that will create a much bigger disaster or famine. Or war, there´s a possible political struggle between China and the West´´ as China asserts greater control over Hong Kong and threatens control over Taiwan, Ai said.

(AP Photo/Luca Bruno) ""We have to rethink about humans and legitimacy in the environment. Do we really deserve this planet, or are we just being so short-sighted and racist? And very, very just self-demanding, selfishness,´´ the artist added. The exhibit also features smaller glass sculptures. One depicts Ai himself as a prisoner, a reference to his months in a Chinese prison in 2011. Another imposes his distorted face on a replica of an 18th-century statue titled ""Allegory of Envy.´´ A wooden sculpture of a tree trunk fills a sacristy. Colored glass hard hats save places in the choir. Lego-brick portrait replicas of famous paintings and the Chinese zodiac line the walls of adjacent rooms. Ai said he thinks Russia´s invasion of Ukraine gave Chinese authorities a ""potential model"" to understand how such an operation might play out in Taiwan, without serving either as encouragement or warning. ""I think China is part of the global power struggle that reflects our modern understanding and the classic notion about territory and who has the right to do what,'' he said. ""What what happens in the Russian and Ukraine conflict gives China a clear maybe mental exercise about what they want to do in Taiwan, if it is needed.'' But the artist says any Chinese invasion of Taiwan would be a mistake and a misunderstanding of Taiwan´s history. ""The Chinese think that Taiwan belongs to China, but in reality China and Taiwan have been apart for over 70 years. They have their own social structure, which is more democratic and more peaceful than in China,´´ he said. Any moves by China to claim Taiwan by force will result ""in the ultimate struggle.´´ He sees the struggle in China as one for legitimacy of authorities' control, while the challenge in the West is the continual need to defend democracy and with it freedom of speech. The West´s Achille´s heel is its economic dependency on China´s cheap manufacturing, he said. ""That is why China is so confident,´´ Ai said. ""They know the West cannot live without China."" He cited instances of Western hypocrisy, including the rejection by festivals in Europe and the United States of films he made during the pandemic depicting Wuhan´s first lockdown and the struggles in Hong Kong. After praising the films, festivals ultimately give ""the last words, we cannot show it,´´ out of fear of losing access to the Chinese market, Ai said. His artworks travel more smoothly, he said, because his artistic language is harder to interpret. ""My work is about a new vocabulary, so it is difficult for somebody who has completely no knowledge. It requires study,'' Ai said. ""I don't make some piece to please the audience. But I always want to say something that is necessary."" Tourists wandering in from the water bus were delighted that they had stumbled into an exhibit by the renowned dissident artist. ""It is metal? When I first saw this I thought it represented hell,´´ Kenneth Cheung, a Hong Kong native now living in Toronto, Canada, said as he checked out the imposing glass sculpture. ""Being in a church, it is even stronger, more powerful."" The main sculpture took three years to realize with assistance from artists at a glass studio on Murano employing three techniques: traditional Murano blown glass, wax molds and injection molds. Studio owner Adriano Berengo said he pursued Ai for years to secure a collaboration with an artist he admires for his strong political beliefs. ""He shows his face. He doesn´t hide. He is ready to risk his life, and he did in China,´´ Berengo said. The exhibit runs through Nov. 27 in Venice. From there, the hanging sculpture will go to the Design Museum in London and then, hopefully a buyer, Berengo said. ""It has to be a big museum. Otherwise, how can you keep an artwork like that?"" he said.

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-11150287/Ukraine-train-station-attack-war-crime-experts-say.html,2022-08-26,"Ukraine train system attacks may be war crimes, experts say","Russia´s attack on a Ukrainian train station that killed more than 20 people this week is the latest in a series of strikes on the country´s railway system that some international legal scholars say may be war crimes. While Russia claimed that it had targeted the train because it was carrying Ukrainian troops and equipment on Wednesday, an Associated Press reporter on the ground said there was no visible indication that Ukrainian troops were among the dead, who included children. If civilians were the target, experts said Thursday, the attack could be considered a war crime. ""A train station is generally a civilian object and should not be a target of attack,"" said Jennifer Trahan, a clinical professor at New York University's Center for Global Affairs. Wednesday´s attack in Chaplyne, a small village in southeastern Ukraine, was one of the deadliest in months on the country´s extensive railway system. In the more than six months since Russia invaded Ukraine, the AP and the PBS series ""Frontline"" have independently verified more than 40 attacks on civilian infrastructure that could be considered war crimes. Three of those hit the country´s railway infrastructure and seven have involved local bus stops, killing more than 100 civilians. In these attacks, there has been little evidence to back up Moscow´s claims that Ukrainian troops were the target. The deadly strike Wednesday came as Ukrainians were defiantly celebrating their Independence Day while remaining on high alert because of threats that Russia would use the occasion to mount attacks. ___ A railway worker looks at a heavily damaged train after a Russian attack on a train station Wednesday during Ukraine's Independence Day in the village Chaplyne, Ukraine, Thursday, Aug. 25, 2022. (AP Photo/Leo Correa) This story is part of an ongoing investigation from The Associated Press and the PBS series ""Frontline"" that includes the War Crimes Watch Ukraine interactive experience and an upcoming documentary. ___ More than 50 people, including children, were on their way to flee Donbas when they were killed in a Russian attack on a train station in Kramatorsk in April. Photos from the aftermath showed dead bodies and abandoned luggage strewn around the station. Rail cars were crushed and hollowed out by fire. Mykola Lukashuk, chair of the Dnipropetrovsk Regional Council, said during a press briefing Friday that the shelling in Chaplyne led to a fire in five carriages of the train. A family, including a 17-year-old daughter, was killed when its car was struck as it was traveling from Donetsk. ""People were being evacuated from Pokrovsk, Donetsk region, and a train was leaving from there to Lviv,"" Lukashuk said. The deputy head of the Ukrainian presidential office, Kyrylo Tymoshenko, said Thursday that an 11-year-old boy died under the rubble of a nearby house and a 6-year-old died in a car fire by the station. Tetyana Kvitnytska, deputy head of the Dnipropetrovsk regional health department, told the AP that those in Wednesday´s attack had suffered head injuries, broken limbs, burns and shrapnel wounds. ""There is no such war crime that the Russian occupiers have not yet committed on the territory of Ukraine,"" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said to the U.N. Security Council on Wednesday. Russia´s Defense Ministry said that an Iskander missile was used to carry out the attack and that 200 reservists ""were destroyed on their way to the combat zone."" An AP reporter who went to the scene said no Ukrainian troops were visible among the dead. Even if some members of the military were among the dead, the attack could still violate the laws of war if it disproportionately harmed civilians. ""If you´re going to kill a small number of troops as opposed to a large number of civilians, that´s a war crime,"" said Michael Newton, a professor at Vanderbilt University's law school and director of the international legal studies program. Iskander missiles are expensive precision guided missiles and are not used for trivial missions, said Frank Ledwidge, visiting fellow at the Transatlantic Dialogue Center in Kyiv and a former British military intelligence officer. ""The takeaway is a deliberate strike on a civilian target to cause civilian casualties for the purpose of disrupting rail traffic of civilians throughout Ukraine,"" he said. In May, Russia used sea- and air-launched precision missiles to strike power facilities at five railway stations mostly in Lviv after claiming that the West was using the rail lines to deliver weapons to Ukraine. It´s not only the train stations that have become targets. Dozens of civilians waiting for buses have been killed in similar attacks. The AP has counted seven incidents where civilians waiting for a bus were killed. Photos of their bodies lying in pools of blood were shared across Telegram after the fact. In Mykolaiv, five people were killed and a dozen were injured at a bus stop during a Russian attack on July 29. Mykolaiv Mayor Oleksandr Senkevych said on Telegram at the time that Russian forces had fired cluster munitions at a crowded intersection around 10 a.m. ___ Editor´s Note: The AP and ""Frontline"" are gathering information from organizations including the Centre for Information Resilience, Bellingcat, the International Partnership on Human Rights, the Ukrainian Healthcare Center and Physicians for Human Rights to inform the War Crimes Watch Ukraine interactive experience. ___ Follow AP's coverage of Russia's war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine.

President Alexander Lukashenko said the upgrade followed his June meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin, who offered to make Belarusian combat aircraft nuclear-capable at Russian factories and to help train pilots. ""Do you think it was all blather?"" Lukashenko said to reporters Friday. ""All of it has been done."" Russia used the territory of Belarus as a staging ground to send troops into Ukraine, and Moscow and Minsk have maintained close military ties. Lukashenko, who has been president since 1994, warned the United States and its allies against carrying out a ""provocation"" against Belarus. He said ""the targets have been selected"" for retaliation, if his warning is not heeded. He didn't specify how many Belarusian warplanes received the upgrade to make them capable to carry nuclear warheads. The Kremlin had no immediate comment on Lukashenko's statement. Earlier this year, Lukashenko said his country could host Russian nuclear weapons if the U.S. and its allies deployed nuclear weapons to NATO members Poland and Lithuania, which border Belarus. Lukashenko has ruled Belarus with an iron hand for 28 years while relying on Russia's political and economic support. In 2020, Moscow helped him survive the largest and the most sustained wave of mass protests in the country´s history, which followed a presidential election that the opposition and the West denounced as rigged."

Speaking through an interpreter, the Korean minister stressed the good relations and trust that the two countries have developed in their business, social and cultural ties. Also attending the ceremony were the heads of the Korean plants involved in the contracts as well as Polish tank crews who will go to Korea for training in October. Poland´s conservative government has worked to strengthen the country's armed forces in response to neighboring Russia´s aggression.

The Turkish Industry and Business Association confirmed this week that it received a letter from U.S. Treasury Deputy Secretary Wally Adeyemo cautioning that Turkish companies risked consequences if they did business with Russians or Russian institutions that were under U.S. sanctions. Since the start of the war in Ukraine six months ago, Turkey has tried to balance its close relations with both Russia and Ukraine, positioning itself as a mediator between the two. The Turkish government criticized Russia´s actions in Ukraine and sold drones to Ukraine that played a significant role in deterring a Russian advance during the early stage of the conflict. But it has not joined the international sanctions against Russia. Turkey has said, however, that it would not allow international sanctions to be breached. In a series of tweets, Turkish Treasury and Finance Minister Nureddin Nebati said it was ""meaningless"" for Turkish businesses to worry about the letter from Washington. ""Turkey is one of the most important political and economic power centers of the world. Our business world should feel the power of the state alongside it at all times,"" the minister tweeted. Earlier this month, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan met with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Sochi, Russia, where the two leaders vowed to further develop bilateral ties. Putin noted at the time that Russian-Turkish trade doubled in the first five months of the year compared to the same period last year, a surge reflecting Moscow´s growing focus on ties with Ankara amid the bruising Western sanctions. Faced with an economic crisis, Turkey is relying on Russia for trade and tourism. Russian gas covers 45% of Turkish energy needs, and Russia´s atomic agency is building Turkey´s first nuclear power plant. Nebati, the finance minister, said Friday that Turkey is confident it can balance its ties with Russia and its international relations. ""We are determined to develop our commercial and economic relations with our neighbors in various sectors, especially in tourism, within a framework that is not subject to sanctions,"" he tweeted. ___ Follow AP's coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine"

In a video message ahead of a meeting in Denmark's capital, Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said Germany wants to hasten the expansion of wind power produced in the Baltic Sea. The countries around the Baltic Sea ""need to set the sails, work together and set course towards making our region more sustainable, more resilient and more secure,"" Baerbock said. German Chancellor Olaf Scholtz has said Germany remains committed to ending its greenhouse gas emissions by 2045, the earliest of any major industrialized nation. To meet the goal, his government has said it would close coal-fired power plants that were reactivated during the war in Ukraine, end imports of Russian oil and coal this year and aim to stop using Russian gas within the next two years. The potential for the Baltic Sea ""is enormous,"" Baerbock said. ""The European Commission estimates that the Baltic Sea could potentially produce more than 90 gigawatts in wind energy. That is more than twice the installed capacity of all German coal-fired power stations."" ""Wind energy from the Baltic Sea will help us fight the climate crisis. And it is an investment in our security: it will help make us less dependent on gas from Russia,"" Baerbock said.

The forum for regional cooperation consists of the European Union and 10 member nations: Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Iceland, Latvia, Lithuania, Norway, Poland and Sweden. Following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the council suspended Russia from its activities. Moscow later said it had decided to withdraw from the council, saying the organization was turning into ""an anti-Russian tool."" In Copenhagen, Baerbock and Danish Foreign Minister Jeppe Kofod signed a plan for closer cooperation between their countries, which includes a plan ""to dramatically scale up offshore wind capacity in the North Sea and the Baltic Sea."" Denmark is holding a meeting next week on the Baltic Sea island of Bornholm to discuss ways ""to make the Baltic Sea region free of Russian energy and at the same time pave the way for a significant green transition."" Those expected to attend include the EU commission president, Lithuania's president, the prime ministers of Poland, Latvia, Estonia, Finland and Denmark and several energy ministers. Speaking alongside Kofod after their meeting, Baerbock said it was important for European countries to show solidarity in the coming months, given Russia's attempts to use energy supplies ""as a weapon of war"" and divide the 27-nation bloc. Germany is studying what impact low water levels on its rivers after months of drought and high electricity demand from neighboring France due to the shutdown of nuclear plants there will have on energy markets over the coming months. Baerbock, a member of the Greens party, said she was skeptical of the idea that extending the operating life of Germany's three remaining atomic power plants would help tackle an expected gas shortage, but acknowledged that this might ease electricity bottlenecks. ""One needs to look at everything in the European context,"" she said. ___ Frank Jordans in Berlin contributed to this report. ___ Follow AP's coverage of the climate and environment at https://apnews.com/hub/climate-and-environment and of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine Denmarks Foreign Minister Jeppe Kofod, left, receives German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock in Eigtveds Pakhus in Copenhagen, Friday Aug. 26, 2022.

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-11148637/IAEA-mission-seeks-visit-Zaporizhzhia-plant-amid-concerns.html,2022-08-26,Fears of a radiation leak mount near Ukrainian nuclear plant,"Authorities began distributing iodine tablets to residents near Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant Friday in case of a radiation leak, amid mounting fears that the fighting around the complex could trigger a catastrophe. The move came a day after the plant was temporarily knocked offline because of what officials said was fire damage to a transmission line. The incident heightened dread of a nuclear disaster in a country still haunted by the 1986 explosion at Chernobyl. Continued shelling was reported in the area overnight, and satellite images from Planet Labs showed fires burning around the complex - Europe's biggest nuclear plant - over the last several days. Iodine tablets, which help block the absorption of radioactive iodine by the thyroid gland in a nuclear accident, were issued in the Ukrainian-controlled city of Zaporizhzhia, about 45 kilometers (27 miles) from the plant. A woman and her small daughter were among those receiving the pills. The U.N.'s atomic energy agency has been trying to send a team in to inspect and help secure the plant. Officials said preparations for the trip were underway, but it remained unclear when it might take place. The Zaporizhzhia plant has been occupied by Russian forces and run by Ukrainian workers since the early days of the 6-month-old war. The two sides have repeatedly accused each other of shelling the site. People receive iodine-containing tablets at a distribution point in Zaporizhzhia, Ukraine, Friday, Aug. 26, 2022.

(AP Photo/Andriy Andriyenko) In Thursday's incident, Ukraine and Russia blamed one another for the transmission-line damage that knocked the plant off the power grid. Exactly what went wrong was not clear, but Ukrainian President Volodymr Zelenskyy said the plant's emergency backup diesel generators had to be activated to supply electricity to operate the complex. The plant requires power to run the reactors' vital cooling systems. A loss of cooling could lead to a nuclear meltdown. Ukrenergo, Ukraine´s transmission system operator, reported Friday that two damaged main lines supplying the plant with electricity had resumed operation, ensuring a stable power supply. The country's nuclear power agency, Energoatom, said the plant had been reconnected to the grid and was producing electricity ""for Ukraine´s needs."" ""The nuclear workers of Zaporizhzhia power plant are real heroes! They tirelessly and firmly uphold the nuclear and radiation safety of Ukraine and the whole of Europe on their shoulders,"" the agency said in a statement. Russia-installed officials in the Zaporizhzhia region, however, said that the plant was supplying electricity only to Russia-controlled areas of the country and not the rest of Ukraine. Concerns about the site have reverberated across Europe. French President Emmanuel Macron said a visit by the U.N.'s International Atomic Energy Agency should be allowed to take place ""very quickly,"" warning: ""Civilian nuclear power must not be an instrument of war."" Lana Zerkal, an adviser to Ukraine's energy minister, told Ukrainian media that the logistics for an IAEA visit were still being worked out. Zerkal accused Russia of trying to sabotage the visit. Ukraine has claimed Russia is using the plant as a shield by storing weapons there and launching attacks from around it. Moscow, for its part, accuses Ukraine of recklessly firing on the place. Zaporizhzhia´s reactors are protected by thick, reinforced concrete containment domes that experts say can withstand an errant artillery shell. Many of the fears center instead on a possible loss of the cooling system, and also the risk that an attack on the cooling ponds where spent fuel rods are kept could scatter radioactive material. Continued Russian shelling of Nikopol, a city across the Dnieper River from the Zaporizhzhia plant, damaged 10 houses, a school and a health care facility but caused no injuries, Dnipropetrovsk Gov. Valentyn Reznichenko said. ___ Follow AP coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine People receive iodine-containing tablets at a distribution point in Zaporizhzhia, Ukraine, Friday, Aug. 26, 2022.

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-11148587/Russia-divestment-promises-US-states-largely-unfulfilled.html,2022-08-26,Russia divestment promises by US states largely unfulfilled,"Driven by moral outrage over Russia´s invasion of Ukraine earlier this year, U.S. governors and other top state officials made it clear: They wanted to cut their financial ties with Russia. A few states quickly followed through. Idaho sold $300,000 of bonds in a Russian oil company in early March. A day before the invasion, the Kentucky Teachers Retirement System sold its shares in the Russian bank Sberbank. But those examples are outliers. Six months into a war that has killed thousands of Ukrainians and displaced over 12 million more, most of the pledges to drop Russian investments - some made with great fanfare during news conferences - have gone unfulfilled, according to an Associated Press review, state retirement administrators and firms that invest state funds. Swift global reaction has cut off much of Russia's economy from the rest of the world. That has made it nearly impossible for divestment by state pension funds, university endowments and other public-sector holdings - as well as private investments such as those in 401(k) accounts. ""These pension funds want to get out, but it´s just not realistic to sell everything in the current environment,"" said Keith Brainard, research director at the National Association of State Retirement Administrators. Benjamin Smith, a spokesperson for the Rhode Island treasury, said the factors that make it hard to divest also show that a worldwide effort to isolate Russian President Vladimir Putin is working.

Driven by moral outrage over Russia's invasion of Ukraine, U.S. governors and other top state officials made it clear: They wanted to cut any financial ties with Russia (AP Photo/Seth Wenig, File) ""This is good news because it means that pressure from investors across the world, including Rhode Island, is succeeding in exacting a toll on the Russian economy, making it more difficult for Putin to fund his military operation, state-owned companies, and corrupt network of oligarchs,"" he said in an email, noting that Rhode Island's pension plan exposure in Russia never exceeded 0.3% of its assets. Any pre-war investments in Russia are now worthless, or nearly so. That's raising questions from some officials and fund managers about whether divesting is even necessary. In Hawaii, one of a handful of states where top administration officials did not pledge to divest, Gov. David Ige said at a May 5 news conference that the state's employee pension system had ""very little to almost nothing"" invested in Russia. ""The few remaining investments are quite small, and so I didn´t feel compelled to just make a statement for political reasons that we would be divesting,"" he said. Before Russia's invasion in late February, many government-controlled investments had only small holdings - a fraction of 1% in every reported case - in Russian investments. But even that could amount to millions of dollars. The largest U.S. public-sector retirement fund, California´s CalPERS, said just 17 cents of every $100 of its portfolio was in Russian investments as the war broke out. Even so, that translated into $765 million worth of stocks, real estate and private equity. By the end of June, the value had shrunk to $194 million. The entire loss was because the holdings dropped in value; none had been sold. There is no way to know how much state government entities in the U.S. have invested in Russia or companies based there, but collectively they were worth billions of dollars before the war. Much of the money was invested in Russian government bonds, oil and coal companies as part of emerging-markets index funds. Quick to condemn the invasion, state officials said they could put pressure on Putin by dumping their Russian investments. ""Our moral imperative before these atrocities demand that you act to address Russia´s aggressions and immediately restrict Russian access to California´s capital and investments,"" California Gov. Gavin Newsom wrote in a letter Feb. 28 to the boards overseeing the massive pension funds that serve teachers, state and local government workers and university employees. Across the country, governors and other top officials made similar statements. Just after the invasion began, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul signed an executive order calling for divestment ""to the extent possible,"" while Arizona's Board of Regents voted to exit any Russian investments. The treasurers for 36 states plus the District of Columbia and U.S. Virgin Islands signed a joint letter in March advocating divestment of publicly controlled funds from Russia. They noted a financial reason for doing so: ""The current crisis also constitutes a substantial risk for states´ investments and our economic security."" A major chunk of the government holdings in Russia are in the form of index funds that investors use to mimic overall stock market performance. Russian stocks were commonly part of funds specializing in emerging markets. MCSI and other firms that decide which stocks should be in the funds quickly dropped Russian securities. But the companies that sell investment products based on those indexes were left in the lurch, still leaving pieces of Russian stocks in their investors' portfolios. As part of the sanctions, stock markets in the U.S. and elsewhere stopped the trading of Russian stocks. And the Moscow Stock Exchange was closed for nearly a month, reopening with tight controls that keep U.S. investors from selling. The assets sank in value amid the invasion, though the precise value isn't always clear. Maryland said that as of the beginning of February, $197 million of its state retirement and pension system funds were invested in Russian assets. A month later, the state estimated the value had plunged and amounted to just $32 million. The state has been unable to unload its investments. For the handful of states in which top officials have not endorsed divestment, eroding values like that are a main reason. Shortly after the invasion, South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster said the amount of state investments in Russia was ""miniscule"" and noted that the value was about to ""shrink to almost nothing as the Russian economy is being virtually shut off from the world."" In Florida, Lamar Taylor, the interim executive director of the agency that oversees investments of pension funds, said during a cabinet meeting that some investment managers might seek to unload Russian assets as soon as they´re able, while others could hold on in case they´re worth more later. At the meeting, Gov. Ron DeSantis said the State Board of Administration has a legal responsibility to try to make money for the retirement system. ""That would violate your fiduciary duty, if you liquidated at massive losses for political reasons rather than for the best interests of the beneficiaries,"" he said. But DeSantis said there was a way to make it easier: Lawmakers passing a bill banning investment in Russia. ""If the Legislature could speak clearly, that would be something we´d welcome here, just to make sure we´re not furthering investments in parts of the world that are not reflective of our interests or values,"" he said. Hank Kim, executive director of the National Conference on Public Employee Retirement Systems, said he has told member pension funds that taking steps to divest is important even if it can´t be completed right away. ""The public has a right to know that it was debated in a serious manner,"" he said. ___ Mulvihill reported from Cherry Hill, New Jersey.

And when she can´t pay, she feels the impact immediately. The power in her London home has gone off suddenly three times recently, once when her partner was cooking an egg. Like millions of people, Jones, 54, is struggling to cope as energy and food prices skyrocket during Britain's worst cost-of-living crisis in a generation. The former school supervisor has health problems and relies on government benefits to get by, but her welfare payments are nowhere near enough to cover her sharply rising bills. ""I´ve always struggled, but not as much,"" she said. ""Everything is going up. I can´t even pay my rent, my council tax, I can´t afford to do anything. ... I keep asking myself, what am I supposed to do?"" And things are getting worse. U.K. residents will see an 80% increase in their annual household energy bills, the country´s energy regulator announced Friday, following a record 54% spike in April. That will bring costs for the average customer from 1,971 pounds ($2,332) a year to 3,549 pounds. The latest price cap - the maximum amount that gas suppliers can charge customers per unit of energy - will take effect Oct. 1, just as the cold months set in. And bills are expected to rise again in January to 4,000 pounds. Jennifer Jones sorts her bills at her small flat in London, Thursday, Aug. 25, 2022.

The former school supervisor has health problems and relies on government benefits to get by, but her welfare payments are nowhere near enough to cover her sharply rising bills. (AP Photo/Frank Augstein) To blame for the increase is the soaring price of wholesale natural gas triggered by Russia´s war in Ukraine, which is driving up consumer prices and roiling economies across Europe that rely on the fuel for heating homes and generating electricity. That includes the United Kingdom, which has the highest inflation rate among the Group of Seven wealthiest democracies and seen disruptive strikes for months as workers push for pay to keep pace with the increasingly expensive cost of living. The energy increases, together with rapidly rising food costs, are expected to push inflation above the 40-year high of 10.1% recorded in July and trigger a recession later this year, the Bank of England has predicted. Charities, public health leaders and even energy firms warn of catastrophic effects on poorer people already struggling to afford essentials as wages lag behind. Jon Taylor, who helps Jones and others at debt counseling charity Christians Against Poverty, said growing numbers of people who have never had debt problems are turning to the group's helpline. ""What I´m seeing a lot of at the moment is personal tragedies, losing loved ones, emotional health problems,"" he said. ""The pressure of not knowing how to pay the next bill or having enough food to survive just accentuates whatever they´re already going through."" About 1 million low-income households have had to take on new or extra debt to cover an essential bill, according to a May study by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, a nonprofit focusing on U.K. poverty. The drop in living standards is ""of a scale we haven´t seen for many decades,"" said Rebecca McDonald, the charity's chief economist. ""It really warrants big and creative national policy interventions in order to prevent what is a difficult year becoming essentially a catastrophe for many low-income families."" Britain´s Conservative government is under heavy pressure to do more to help people and businesses - and fast. Authorities have said they´re sending around 1,200 pounds to low-income people. Every household, no matter their financial situation, will get 400 pounds off their energy bills this winter. Many say that financial support needs to be doubled - at least -and some have called for an immediate freeze on the amount that suppliers can charge for energy. The opposition Labour Party has called for an extension of the government´s temporary tax on the windfall profits of oil and gas companies to help pay for relief. But the government has said no further measures will be announced until the Conservative Party announces a new leader to replace Boris Johnson on Sept. 5. Neither Liz Truss nor Rishi Sunak, the two politicians vying to become the next prime minister, appear to support taxing energy giants. Treasury chief Nadhim Zahawi acknowledged that the increase in the energy price cap would cause ""stress and anxiety."" But he insisted the government was ready to develop more options to support households. ""While (Russian President Vladimir) Putin is driving up energy prices in revenge for our support of Ukraine´s brave struggle for freedom, I am working flat out to develop options for further support,'' he said. ""This will mean the incoming prime minister can hit the ground running and deliver support to those who need it most, as soon as possible."" Unions across multiple key sectors have reacted by going on strike to demand pay raises that keep pace with inflation. A series of national rail strikes brought the U.K. train network to a standstill during peak travel days this summer, and postal and port workers, garbage collectors and lawyers have all staged walkouts over pay disputes. Meanwhile, a grassroots movement called ""Don´t Pay"" is campaigning to gather 1 million people who will commit to not paying their energy bills on Oct. 1 if the price hike goes ahead. The group is hoping that mass nonpayment will force energy firms to end the crisis. ""Everyone we speak to thinks that the price increases we´ve seen and are going to be seeing on Oct. 1 are beyond a joke and will push people to the edge,"" said Jeffrey James, one of the campaign´s organizers. ""We are being forced into poverty, whilst others who are already in poverty will be forced into a life-or-death situation this winter,"" he added. ""That is the level of discontent and despair we are talking about."" ___ AP reporter Danica Kirka contributed from London.

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-11148415/Gritty-cult-director-Ferrara-gets-religion-Padre-Pio.html,2022-08-26,Gritty cult director Ferrara gets religion in 'Padre Pio',"Abel Ferrara, whose gritty New York exploitation films of the 1980s and 1990s delved into the soulless evils of drug addiction, corruption and sexual violence, pays homage to one of Italy´s best-known and most revered saints in his newest film, ""Padre Pio."" That the film, which stars Shia LaBeouf and premieres at the Venice Film Festival next week, confirms a change of pace for the cult director is an understatement, one that Ferrara, 71, chalks up to a decade of sobriety and a new life in Italy. ""Once we kicked the drugs and the alcohol, we started to see a different way of life, of living in a different life,"" the ""Bad Lieutenant"" director said in an interview in his new hometown of Rome. ""I think it´s more just trying to get our game right."" The film chronicles a particular moment in the 20th century history of Italy and Padre Pio, the mystic Capuchin monk best known for having displayed the ""stigmata"" wounds of Christ: He bled from his hands, feet and sides. Padre Pio died in 1968 and was canonized in 2002 by St. John Paul II, going on to become one of the most popular saints in Italy, the U.S. and beyond. Ferrara´s treatment is no biopic, and frankly ignores some of the juiciest bits of the Padre Pio saga, which involved a dozen Vatican investigations into purported dalliances with women, alleged financial improprieties and doubts about the stigmatas. In their place, Ferrara weaves a parallel tale about the beginnings of fascism in Italy that is, unexpectedly, utterly relevant today. The film takes as its starting point Padre Pio´s arrival at a Capuchin monastery in San Giovanni Rotondo, a poverty-wracked town in southern Italy, at the time its soldiers were returning home from World War I. The town was almost feudal-like, with the Catholic Church and wealthy large landowners trying to hold onto power amid the first inklings of Italy´s post-war socialist movement that saw factory unrest and peasant strikes. Director Abel Ferrara gestures during an interview with the Associated Press on his latest movie ""Padre Pio"" in Rome, Tuesday, Aug. 23, 2022. Abel Ferrara, whose gritty New York exploitation films of the 1980s and 1990s delved into the soulless evils of drug addiction, corruption and sexual violence, pays homage to one of Italy's best-known and most revered saints in his newest film, ""Padre Pio."" (AP Photo/Gregorio Borgia) That social unrest erupted into a little-known police massacre of peasants in San Giovanni after the socialists won a 1920 local election, the results of which the entrenched, church-backed ruling class refused to respect. When the winning socialists tried to hang their red flag on the municipal building and install their mayor on Oct. 14, 1920, police were on hand, shots rang out and 14 people were killed and 80 injured. For Ferrara, the ""Massacre of San Giovanni Rotondo"" helped foretell the spread of fascism in Italy. Ferrara, who has lived in Italy for some two decades, began making the film five years ago, long before the Jan. 6 insurrection in his native U.S., in which supporters of President Donald Trump stormed the U.S. Capitol after refusing to respect the results of the 2020 election, or the rise of the far-right Brothers of Italy party in his adopted country. The Brothers of Italy, which has neo-fascist roots, leads the polls ahead of Italian parliamentary elections next month. Add to the mix Russia´s invasion of Ukraine, and Ferrara sees history repeating itself. ""When Jan. 6 happens after you´ve been working on this film for five years, it´s like: Right, elections are great until you lose,"" he said. The film is dedicated to the victims of the 1920 massacre as well as the people of Ukraine. Why? ""What I´m looking at is a rerun of World War II. Seventy-five million people died 70 years ago. That´s like, yesterday. It´s happening right in front of our eyes,"" he said. The context of the film, he said solemnly, is: ""You´re looking at the end of the world."" Ferrara´s concern with Italian history, Catholicism and his fascination with Padre Pio are not new: The Bronx-born Ferrara was raised Catholic and introduced to both Italy and the saint by his grandfather, who was born in a town not far from Padre Pio´s hometown of Pietrelcina. Those interests have emerged in Ferrara´s more recent films, including ""Pasolini"" which paid tribute to the scandalous life and violent death of Italian director Pier Paolo Pasolini and premiered at Venice in 2014; and ""Mary,"" about an actor (Juliette Binoche) playing Mary Magdalene in a film, which won the Grand Jury prize at Venice in 2005. Both ""Pasolini"" and ""Padre Pio"" relied heavily on the diaries, writings and documentation of their subjects, and Ferrara first made a documentary about the saint´s life before deciding to zero in on the particular period of his arrival in San Giovanni Rotondo, his doubts about his faith and the events surrounding the 1920 massacre. ""I thought the confluence between the massacre and his stigmata both happening in the same place at the same time ... I mean how could you not make a movie about that?"" Ferrara said. But Ferrara is well aware that his early genre work - he has done pornography, rape-revenge, the 1993 cult classic about a corrupt, drug-addicted cop ""Bad Lieutenant,"" and his earlier ""The Driller Killer,"" about a New York artist who randomly kills people with a power drill - gave him something of a reputation. ""Given the list of films I´d made you´d be wondering,"" Ferrara admits. But he said church officials and the Capuchin friars who advised on set were entirely supportive of the project and its star, LaBeouf, who has admitted to alcoholism and has been accused by a former girlfriend of abuse.

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-11148343/Taiwan-China-Russia-disrupting-threatening-world-order.html,2022-08-26,"Taiwan: China, Russia disrupting, threatening world order","Taiwan´s leader on Friday said China and Russia are ""disrupting and threatening the world order"" with Beijing´s recent large-scale military exercises near the island and Moscow´s invasion of Ukraine. President Tsai Ing-wen was speaking during a meeting in Taipei with U.S. Sen. Marsha Blackburn, who is on the second visit by members of Congress since House Speaker Nancy Pelosi´s trip earlier this month. That visit prompted China to launch military exercises in which it fired numerous missiles and sent dozens of warplanes and naval ships to virtually surround the island. Some ships crossed the center line in the Taiwan Strait that has long been a buffer between the sides. China claims Taiwan as its own territory, to be brought under its control by force if necessary. Beijing has also boosted its relations with Russia and is seen as tacitly supporting Moscow's attack on Ukraine. ""These developments demonstrate how authoritarian countries are disrupting and threatening the world order,"" Tsai said. Blackburn, a Republican from Tennessee, reaffirmed shared values between the two governments and said she ""looked forward to continuing to support Taiwan as they push forward as an independent nation."" In later remarks at the Foreign Ministry´s Institute of Diplomacy and International Affairs, Blackburn criticized leaders she did not identify for failing to take the threat from authoritarian regimes seriously enough. In this photo released by the Taiwan Presidential Office, U.S. Sen. Marsha Blackburn meets with Taiwan's President Tsai Ing-wen in Taipei, Taiwan on Friday, Aug. 26, 2022. Blackburn met with Tsai on Friday, in the second visit by members of Congress since House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's trip earlier this month sharply raised tensions with China. (Taiwan Presidential Office via AP) Xi Jinping, China's president and leader of the ruling Communist Party, ""will not stop threatening the safety and security of Taiwan simply because it would be in everyone´s best interest to do so,"" she said. ""He is not a normal leader. And he has no interest in normal reactions or normal relations with the rest of the world."" In Beijing, China´s Foreign Ministry said in a statement it deplores Blackburn´s visit and urges her to cease all forms of official communication with Taiwan, saying it sends the wrong signal to Taiwan independence forces. China sees high-level foreign visits to Taiwan as interference in its affairs and a de facto recognition of Taiwanese sovereignty. China´s recent military drills were seen by some as a rehearsal of future military action against the island, which U.S. military leaders say could come within the next few years. Along with staging the exercises, China cut off contacts with the United States on vital issues, including military matters and crucial climate cooperation, raising concerns over a more aggressive approach by Beijing. It also called in U.S. Ambassador to China Nicholas Burns to formally complain. He later said China was overreacting in order to manufacture a crisis. Due to the separation of powers in the U.S. government, the executive branch has no authority to prevent legislators from making such foreign visits and Taiwan benefits from strong bipartisan support in Washington. China, where the Communist Party wields total control over the country's politics, refuses to acknowledge that fundamental principle. U.S. State Department spokesperson Vedant Patel said members of Congress and elected officials ""have gone to Taiwan for decades and will continue to do so,"" and that it was in line with U.S. policy to only maintain formal diplomatic ties with Beijing. ""We´re going to continue to take calm and resolute steps to uphold peace and stability in the region and to support Taiwan in line with our longstanding policy,"" Patel said at a briefing Thursday. Meanwhile, Taiwanese Foreign Minister Joseph Wu told reporters Friday that ""China´s motivation is to destroy the Taiwan Straits' status quo, and after this they want to cut down on Taiwan´s defensive space."" Taiwan is seeking stepped-up defense cooperation and additional weaponry from the U.S., along with closer economic ties. In their meeting, Tsai and Blackburn underscored the importance of economic links, especially in the semiconductor sector, where Taiwan is a world leader and the U.S. is seeking greater investment at home. Blackburn arrived in Taipei late Thursday after visiting Fiji, the Solomon Islands and Papua New Guinea as part of a U.S. push to ""expand our diplomatic footprint in the area,"" her office said in a statement. ""The Indo-Pacific region is the next frontier for the new axis of evil,"" Blackburn, a supporter of former President Donald Trump, was quoted as saying. ""We must stand against the Chinese Communist Party."" China has been making inroads in the western Pacific, signing a broad security agreement with the Solomon Islands that the U.S. and allies such as Australia see as an attempt to overthrow the traditional security order in the region. Pelosi was the highest-level member of the U.S. government to visit Taiwan in 25 years. China´s response was to announce six zones surrounding the island for military exercises that included firing missiles over the island, some of which landed in Japan´s exclusive economic zone. Following Pelosi´s trip, a delegation of House and Senate members visited. This week, Indiana´s governor made a visit focused on business and academic cooperation. U.S politicians have called their visits a show of support for the island. Blackburn, whose visit is to last three days, also met with Foreign Minister Wu and Secretary General of the National Security Council Wellington Koo, along with members of the American business community. Washington has no official diplomatic ties with Taipei in deference to China, but remains the island´s biggest security guarantor, with U.S. law requiring it ensure Taiwan has the means to defend itself and to regard threats to the island as matters of ""grave concern."" Taiwan and China split in 1949 after a civil war and have no official relations but are bound by billions of dollars of trade and investment. China has increased its pressure on Taiwan since it elected independence-leaning Tsai as its president. When Tsai refused to endorse the concept of a single Chinese nation, China cut off contact with the Taiwanese government. U.S. congressional visits to the island have stepped up in frequency in the past year. In this photo released by the Taiwan Presidential Office, Taiwan's President Tsai Ing-wen meets with U.S. Sen.

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-11148233/Nuclear-treaty-conference-near-end-Ukraine-spotlight.html,2022-08-26,Russia blocks final document at nuclear treaty conference,"Russia late Friday blocked agreement on the final document of a four-week review of the U.N. treaty considered the cornerstone of nuclear disarmament which criticized its military takeover of Europe´s largest nuclear plant soon after Russian troops invaded Ukraine, an act that has raised fears of a nuclear disaster. Igor Vishnevetsky, deputy director of the Russian Foreign Ministry´s Non-Proliferation and Arms Control Department, told the delayed final meeting of the conference reviewing the 50-year-old Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty that ""unfortunately there is no consensus on this document."" He insisted that many countries - not just Russia - didn´t agree with ""a whole host of issues"" in the 36-page last draft. The final document needed approval of all countries at the conference that are parties to the treaty aimed at curbing the spread of nuclear weapons and ultimately achieving a world without them. Argentine Ambassador Gustavo Zlauvinen, president of the conference, said the final draft represented his best efforts to address divergent views and the expectations of the parties ""for a progressive outcome"" at a moment in history when ""our world is increasingly wracked by conflicts, and, most alarmingly, the ever growing prospect of the unthinkable nuclear war."" But after Vishnevetsky spoke, Zlauvinen told delegates, ""I see that at this point, the conference is not in a position to achieve agreement on its substantive work."" The NPT review conference is supposed to be held every five years but was delayed because of the COVID-19 pandemic. This marked the second failure of its 191 state parties to produce an outcome document. The last review conference in 2015 ended without an agreement because of serious differences over establishing a Middle East zone free of weapons of mass destruction. FILE - The symbol of the United Nations is displayed outside the Secretariat Building during an emergency meeting of the UN General Assembly, Monday, Feb. 28, 2022, at the United Nations Headquarters, in New York. As 191 countries approach the end to a four-week conference to review the landmark U.N. treaty aimed at curbing the spread of nuclear weapons, Russia's invasion of Ukraine and takeover of Europe's largest nuclear power plant and rivalries between the West and China were posing key obstacles to agreement on a final document. (AP Photo/John Minchillo, File) Those differences haven´t gone away but are being discussed, and the draft outcome documents obtained by The Associated Press would have reaffirmed the importance of establishing a nuclear-free Mideast zone. So, this was not viewed as a major stumbling block this year. The issue that changed the dynamics of the conference was Russia´s invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, which brought Russian President Vladimir Putin´s warning that Russia is a ""potent"" nuclear power and that any attempt to interfere would lead to ""consequences you have never seen."" He also put Russia´s nuclear forces on high alert. Putin has since rolled back, saying that ""a nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought,"" a message reiterated by a senior Russian official on the opening day of the NPT conference on Aug. 2. But the Russian leader´s initial threat and the occupation of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in southeastern Ukraine as well as the takeover of the Chernobyl nuclear plant, scene of the world´s worst nuclear disaster in 1986, renewed global fears of another nuclear emergency. The four references in the draft final document to the Zaporizhzhia plant, where Russia and Ukraine accuse each other of shelling, would have had the parties to the NPT express ""grave concern for the military activities"" at or near the facility and other nuclear plants. It also would have recognized Ukraine´s loss of control and the International Atomic Energy Agency´s inability to ensure the plant´s nuclear material is safeguarded. It supported IAEA efforts to visit Zaporizhzhia to ensure there is no diversion of its nuclear materials, a trip the agency´s director is hoping to organize in the coming days. The draft also expressed ""grave concern"" at the safety of Ukraine´s nuclear facilities, in particular Zaporizhzia, and stressed ""the paramount importance of ensuring control by Ukraine´s competent authorities."" After the conference´s failure to adopt the document, dozens of countries took the floor to express their views. Indonesia, speaking on behalf of the Nonaligned Movement comprising 120 developing countries, expressed disappointment at the failure, calling the final document ""of utmost importance."" Yann Hwang, France´s ambassador to the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva, read a statement on behalf of 56 countries and the European Union reaffirming unwavering support to Ukraine and deploring Russia´s ""dangerous nuclear rhetoric, actions and provocative statements about raising its nuclear alert level."" The countries expressed deep concern that Russia is undermining international peace and the objectives of the NPT ""by waging its illegal war of aggression against Ukraine."" Russia´s deputy delegation head, Andrei Belousov, said the conference had become ""a political hostage"" to countries that were ""poisoning discussions"" with political language on Ukraine and were determined ""to settle scores with Russia by raising issues that are not directly related to the treaty."" ""These states, namely Ukraine and the backers of the Kyiv regime, bear full responsibility for the absence of a final positive result,"" he said. Adam Scheinman, the U.S. special representative for nuclear nonproliferation, noted the final draft never named Russia, and he said it understated the situation at the Zaporizhzhia plant ""and failed to acknowledge what we all know to be true - that the risk of radiological disaster only exists because of Russia´s war of choice."" ""Russia is the reason we do not have consensus today,"" he said. ""The last-minute changes that Russia sought were not of a minor character. They were intended to shield Russia´s obvious intent to wipe Ukraine off the map."" Under the NPT´s provisions, the five original nuclear powers - the United States, China, Russia (then the Soviet Union), Britain and France - agreed to negotiate toward eliminating their arsenals someday and nations without nuclear weapons promised not to acquire them in exchange for a guarantee to be able to develop nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. The draft final document would have expressed deep concern ""that the threat of nuclear weapons use today is higher than at any time since the heights of the Cold War and at the deteriorated international security environment."" It would also have committed parties to the treaty ""to making every effort to ensure that nuclear weapons are never used again."" Rebecca Johnson, a British nuclear analyst and co-founder of the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons, which won the 2017 Nobel Peace Prize, said that ""after weeks of negotiations at a time of war, unprecedented global risks and heightened nuclear threats, it is clearer than ever now that nuclear abolition is urgent and necessary."" Daryl Kimball, executive director of the Washington-based Arms Control Association, said: ""This NPT conference represents a missed opportunity to strengthen the treaty and global security by agreeing to a specific action plan with benchmarks and timeframes that is essential to effectively address the growing dangers of nuclear arms racing and nuclear weapons use."""

The U.S. Open, the year's last Grand Slam tennis tournament, starts Monday. (AP Photo/Seth Wenig) Play in the two-week tournament begins Monday with the top half of the men's bracket and bottom half of the women's bracket, which includes Serena Williams playing the opening match of what is expected to be her final U.S. Open - and could be her last tournament appearance anywhere. The top half of the women's field and bottom half of the men's will play Tuesday. The women´s singles final is Saturday, Sept. 10; the men´s singles final is Sunday, Sept. 11. SEEDINGS Iga Swiatek is seeded No. 1 in the women´s draw; Anett Kontaveit is No. 2 and would be Williams' opponent in the second round if both win their opening matches. Defending champion Daniil Medvedev is No. 1 in the men´s draw. Rafael Nadal is No. 2 after winning the Australian Open and French Open this year to give him a men's-record 22 Grand Slam singles titles. He hasn't played in New York since winning the last of his four U.S. Open titles in 2019. The men's field is missing two top-10 players, with Novak Djokovic unable to travel to the United States because he is not vaccinated against COVID-19 and Alexander Zverev recovering from ankle surgery. 2021 WOMEN´S SINGLES CHAMPION Emma Raducanu, Britain 2021 MEN´S SINGLES CHAMPION Daniil Medvedev, Russia LAST YEAR Ranked just 150th, and appearing in her second major tournament, Raducanu became the first qualifier to win a Grand Slam title. She didn't drop a set in the tournament, capping it with a 6-4, 6-3 victory over another unseeded teenager, Leylah Fernandez of Canada. At 18, Raducanu became the youngest female major champion since Maria Sharapova was 17 in 2004. Medvedev stopped Djokovic's bid to become the first men's player to win a calendar-year Grand Slam since 1969 with a 6-4, 6-4, 6-4 victory in the final for his first major title. KEY STATISTICS 23 - Grand Slam singles titles for Williams, more than any other woman or man in the professional era of tennis, which began in 1968. 2004 - The last time a man other than Djokovic, Nadal, Roger Federer or Andy Murray was the No. 1 seed in a Grand Slam tournament. PRIZE MONEY Total player compensation reached $60 million for the first time, but the women´s and men´s singles champions each will receive $2.6 million - a 33% decrease from the $3.9 million the winners received in 2019, the last pre-pandemic edition of the tournament. At the other end of the scale, players losing in the first round of singles will earn $80,000, a jump of 38% from $58,000 three years ago. ___ More AP coverage of U.S. Open tennis: https://apnews.com/hub/us-open-tennis-championships and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports Arthur Ashe Stadium is seen before the start of the U.S. Open tennis tournament in New York, Thursday, Aug. 25, 2022.

It's unclear whether Russia has begun flying the drones against Ukrainian targets, but the drones appear to be operational and ready to use, said the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive intelligence. The reported shipment marks the latest sign of what appears to be closer military cooperation between the longtime allies. It also underscores warnings from critics of the ongoing negotiations for Iran to resume its compliance with the 2015 nuclear deal that the United States left in 2018. An agreement for Iran and the U.S. to return to the deal, which would grant Iran billions of dollars in sanctions relief in return for curbs on its nuclear program, is inching forward. Opponents of a deal say lifting sanctions on Tehran could enable Russia to strengthen its war effort in Ukraine and circumvent penalties imposed after the February invasion by funneling oil and other products through Iran. The arrival of the drones in the Ukraine war was first reported by The Washington Post. Destroyed houses after a Russian attack are seen in the village Chaplyne, Ukraine, Thursday, Aug. 25, 2022. The death toll from a Russian rocket attack on a train station and the surrounding area as Ukraine celebrated its Independence Day climbed to 25, including at least two children, Ukrainian authorities said Thursday. Russia said it targeted a military train and claimed to have killed more than 200 Ukrainian reservists. (AP Photo/Inna Varenytsia) Ukraine has made great use of drones for surveilling and attacking Russian targets in the six-month war, relying on technology supplied by the U.S. and other partners, including Turkey. An explosive device carried by a drone last month struck the headquarters of Russia´s Black Sea Fleet on the Crimean Peninsula, injuring several people. Supporters of Ukraine have also raised money to buy drones for the war effort. Facing economic sanctions and limits on its supply chains due to its invasion of Ukraine, Russia has increasingly turned to Iran as a key partner and supplier of weapons. The White House first publicly warned last month that Iran was planning to supply Moscow with ""hundreds"" of armed drones. Days later, it alleged Russian officials had visited Iran twice to arrange a transfer. Speaking last month, Iran's foreign minister, Hossein-Amir Abdollahian, said Tehran had ""various types of collaboration with Russia, including in the defense sector."" ""But we won´t help either of the sides involved in this war because we believe that it (the war) needs to be stopped,"" he said. Iran's mission to the United Nations did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The signs of increased cooperation between Moscow and Tehran have added to concerns about the nuclear talks. President Joe Biden's administration this week responded to Iran's latest offer to resume compliance with the previous agreement. There is now expected to be another exchange of technical details followed by a meeting of the joint commission that oversees the deal. The developments, including stepped-up public messaging campaigns by both Tehran and Washington, as well as Israel, which is opposed to a deal, suggest that an agreement could be near. The Israelis continue to have broad concerns about reviving a deal they had vehemently opposed in 2015, but are also wary of language included in the proposed European text that covers additional items, according to diplomats familiar with Israel´s position. Israel has made its stance clear in public statements this week by Prime Minister Yair Lapid and in private conversations in Washington involving Israel's national security adviser and its defense minister, Benny Gantz, who will meet Biden's national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, on Friday. Israeli officials worry a return to the deal will boost Iran´s cooperation with Russia, including potentially allowing Moscow to evade Ukraine-related sanctions by exporting energy through Iran if the sanctions are eased, said the diplomats, who were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. They said Israel is concerned about provisions related to the expiration of restrictions on Iran´s atomic program that will remain the same as in the initial agreement. That means what had been a 10-year or 15-year ban on certain activities would now be only a 3-year or 8-year ban. Among other concerns: -Iran's ""breakout time"" - the period it would need to produce a nuclear weapon - has been reduced from one year to six months. -an Iranian demand that the International Atomic Energy Agency close its investigation of alleged safeguard violations. Israel and other skeptics of the deal worry the IAEA may be pressured to drop the inquiry even if Iran continues to stonewall its inspectors. Europe is eager for a deal, given it would mean renewed access to Iranian oil that could replace the loss of Russian energy imports severely curtailed by war-related sanctions. American officials have assured Israel that the U.S. will not pressure the agency´s chief, Rafael Grossi, to end the matter before Iran has answered the outstanding questions. The U.S. and others pressed Grossi´s predecessor to drop an investigation into Iran´s previous nuclear work after the original deal was agreed to in 2015. -Iran´s demand for guarantees that the U.S. would not reimpose sanctions for at least five years if a future administration pulled out of the deal, provided Iran remained in compliance. Diplomats say Iran has signaled a willingness to reduce that period to 2 1/2 years, but there are questions whether the Biden administration could make a promise that would bind a future president or Congress. -the potential for Iran´s Revolutionary Guards to earn money from international contracts even if that group isn´t removed from the U.S. list of ""foreign terrorist organizations."" It operates a massive number of companies under U.S. sanctions that can also also penalize foreign businesses from entering contracts with them. Iran is seeking a removal of a requirement that forces companies to ensure any investments they make in Iran are not with entities controlled by the Revolutionary Guards. ___ Associated Press writer Josef Federman in Tel Aviv, Israel, contributed to this report. ___ Follow all AP stories on the Russian invasion of Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine and on the Iranian nuclear deal at https://apnews.com/hub/iran-nuclear In this frame grab provided from AP TV, a site of destroyed houses seen after a Russian attack in the village Chaplyne, Ukraine, Thursday, Aug. 25, 2022.

Heavy machinery was spotted behind a green privacy fence at the foot of the nearly 80-meter (260-foot) obelisk shortly before it was felled. The column, which had stood like a high-rise in downtown Riga, crashed into a nearby pond, causing a huge splash at Victory Park. A Latvian media outlet broadcast the event live as onlookers, some with Latvian flags wrapped around their shoulders, cheered and applauded. The obelisk, made up of five spires with three Soviet stars at the top, stood between two groups of statues - a band of three Red Army soldiers and on the other side a woman representing the ""Motherland"" with her arms held high. The monument was built in 1985 while Latvia was still part of the Soviet Union. It has stirred controversy since Latvia regained independence in 1991 and eventually became a NATO and European Union member. On Twitter, Latvia's foreign minister said by taking down the monument, Latvia was ""closing another painful page of the history and looking for better future.""

(Kaspars Krafts/F64 via AP) The country shares a 214-kilometer (133-mile) border with Russia and has a large ethnic Russian population. On Russia´s annual Victory Day, which commemorates the Soviet victory over Germany in World War II, people gathered in front of the Riga monument to lay flowers. Latvia´s parliament voted to approve the demolition of the Victory Park monument in May, and the Riga City Council followed suit. Work to clear away the monument started three days ago with the removal of statues. The area was then cordoned off and authorities issued a flight ban for drones. Police temporarily closed traffic near the park on Thursday, citing security reasons. Russia's invasion of Ukraine in late February has prompted authorities in several eastern European countries to remove symbols from their communist eras. The government in Poland -- another country once was part of the Soviet sphere -- said Thursday that a memorial site in neighboring Belarus containing the graves of Polish soldiers who died during World War II is being leveled to the ground by the Belarusian authorities. Lukasz Jasina, a Foreign Ministry spokesman, said on Twitter that the cemetery in Surkonty, where Poland´s resistance battled Soviet forces, is being ""devastated by the services of the Minsk regime."" The development comes a day after Poland said it was demolishing a monument to Soviet Red Army soldiers in Poland, one of dozens that have been marked for destruction. Belarus has been a key ally to Moscow while Poland, which lies on Ukraine´s western border, has been supportive of Ukraine. Last week , Estonia removed a Soviet World War II monument from near a city on the Russian border as part of a wider effort to dismantle Soviet-era symbols. The tank replica was sent to a war museum north of Tallinn. In 2007, the relocation of a World War II monument of a Red Army soldier in Estonia´s capital, Tallinn, sparked days of rioting. ___ Follow the AP´s coverage of the war at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine ___ Vanessa Gera in Warsaw, Poland, contributed to this report.

Yevgeny Roizman, 59, who served as the mayor of Yekaterinburg from 2013 to 2018, was allowed to walk free, but was barred from attending public events, using the internet, telephone or mail and communicating with anyone other than his lawyers and close family. Police arrested Roizman on Wednesday. He told reporters the case against him was launched under a new law adopted after Russia sent troops into Ukraine on Feb. 24. He faces up to three years in prison if convicted. Russian courts fined Roizman three times earlier this year on similar charges, paving the way for a criminal case the law authorizes for repeat offenders. Roizman, a sharp critic of the Kremlin, is one of the most visible and charismatic opposition figures in Russia. During his tenure as mayor, he enjoyed broad popularity in Yekaterinburg, a city of 1.5 million in the Ural Mountains. His arrest triggered protests in his support, and one demonstrator was detained and ordered to serve 15 days in jail. Roizman said the criminal charges against him were triggered by him calling the Kremlin´s actions in Ukraine an ""invasion."" The Kremlin describes it as a ""special military operation."" Days after Russian President Vladimir Putin sent troops into Ukraine on Feb. 24, Russia´s Kremlin-controlled parliament approved legislation that outlawed alleged disparaging of the Russian military or the spread of ""false information"" about the country's military operation in Ukraine. Russian courts have increasingly handed out fines and, occasionally, prison terms to critics of Moscow´s action in Ukraine. OVD-Info, a legal aid group that tracks political arrests in Russia, has counted 90 criminal cases on charges of spreading false information about the Russian military since Feb. 24. According to Net Freedoms, another legal aid group focused on free speech cases, as of mid-August there were up to 4,000 administrative cases on charges of disparaging the armed forces. Roizman remains one of the few visible opposition figures in Russia who had not yet been been jailed or fled the country under pressure from authorities. Two other prominent opposition politicians, Ilya Yashin and Vladimir Kara-Murza, were arrested under the same law as Roizman and face up to 10 years in prison, if convicted. Similar charges were recently brought against eight close associates of imprisoned opposition leader Alexei Navalny, Putin's most well-known critic. All of them have left Russia after they became the subjects of multiple criminal investigations."

It´s a welcome signal for consumers dealing with high grocery bills and investors hoping to see inflation loosen its grip on the broader economy. Wheat prices are down roughly 40% and corn prices have slipped about 25% since the spring. ""It should help, it´s just a question of how long that is sustainable,"" said Tom Martin, senior portfolio manager with Globalt Investments. ""As we slow down, and the economy seems generally to be slower, you get less inflationary pressures."" Surging food and energy prices have fueled the hottest inflation in four decades this year. Steady demand combined with constricted supplies started inflation on its upward path. Russia´s invasion of Ukraine in February worsened things by choking off production and exports of wheat and other crops, along with oil and natural gas. Now prices are falling as supply and demand start to balance out amid the global economic slowdown. Ukraine and Russia have reached a deal on grain exports, helping to further ease global supply shortages. Ukraine exports roughly 10% of the world´s wheat and corn. The U.S. Department of Agriculture forecasts higher wheat production this year and the potential for a record soybean harvest.

Both Conagra and Mondelez have seen profit margins fall over the last several quarters. Conagra CEO Sean Connolly said another cycle of extreme inflation would likely push down margins, but slowing inflation or deflation could lift profits to the higher end of the company's target. ""These are volatile times,"" he told investors in a conference call, following the company's most recent financial results. ""So we can´t tell you exactly where we will land."" Investors are closely watching falling commodity prices as they try and gauge inflation´s path forward and whether the Federal Reserve will ease up on its aggressive interest rate hikes. The U.S. economy shrank during the first half of 2022, but consumer spending remains solid and unemployment is at a record low. The Fed has signaled that it intends to continue raising interest rates until it is sure that inflation is starting to cool off. Wall Street is hoping that a sustained drop in commodity prices, from energy to food, will result in inflation peaking and starting to cool."

Putin´s decree, which takes effect on Jan. 1, didn´t specify whether the military will beef up its ranks by drafting a bigger number of conscripts, increasing the number of volunteer soldiers or using a combination of both. But some Russian military analysts predicted it would rely heavily on volunteers, a cautious stand reflecting the Kremlin's concerns about a possible fallout from an attempt to increase the draft. The presidential decree will boost the overall number of Russian military personnel to 2,039,758, including 1,150,628 troops. A previous order put the military's numbers at 1,902,758 and 1,013,628 respectively at the start of 2018. The Kremlin has said that only volunteer contract soldiers take part in what it calls the ""special military operation"" in Ukraine, rejecting claims that it was pondering a mobilization. Russian media and non-governmental organizations say Russian authorities have sought to bolster the number of troops involved in the military action in Ukraine by attracting more volunteers, engaging private military contractors and even offering amnesty to some prisoners in exchange for a tour of military duty. Regional authorities have also tried to help beef up the ranks, forming volunteer battalions to be deployed to Ukraine.

(AP Photo/Alexandr Kulikov, file) All Russian men aged 18-27 must serve one year in the military, but a large share avoid the draft for health reasons or deferments granted to university students. The share of men who avoid the draft is particularly big in Moscow and other major cities. The Russian military rounds up draftees twice a year, starting April 1 and Oct. 1. Putin ordered the drafting of 134,500 conscripts during the latest spring draft earlier this year and 127,500 last fall. In recent years, the Kremlin has emphasized increasing the share of volunteer contract soldiers as it sought to modernize the army and improve its capability. Before the Kremlin sent troops into Ukraine on Feb. 24, the Russian military had over 400,000 contract soldiers, including about 147,000 in the ground forces. The number of conscripts has been estimated at around 270,000, and officers and non-commissioned officers have accounted for the rest. Military analysts say if the campaign in Ukraine drags on, those numbers could be clearly insufficient to sustain the operations in Ukraine, which has declared a goal of forming a 1-million-strong military. But many observers have warned that a broad mobilization or a sweeping increase in the number of draftees could fuel public discontent and destabilize the political situation in Russia. That happened during the separatist wars in Chechnya in the 1990s and the early 2000s, when poorly trained Russian conscripts were sent into combat and suffered heavy losses. Col. Retired Viktor Murakhovsky noted that Putin's decree on Thursday reflected the pressure of filling the ranks amid the military action in Ukraine. In comments carried by the RBC online news outlet, he charged that the Kremlin would likely try to keep relying on volunteers and predicted that they would account for the bulk of the increase ordered by the Kremlin. Another Russian military expert, Alexei Leonkov, also said the authorities wouldn't expand the draft and would increase the number of troops by hiring more contract soldiers. ""The new military equipment has become more complex, and people operating it need training for at least three years,"" Leonkov was quoted as saying by the state RIA Novosti news agency. ""A draft won't help that, so there will be no increase in the number of draftees."" Russian President Vladimir Putin attends a meeting in Moscow, Russia, Thursday, Aug. 25, 2022.

The South Koreans hailed the deal as a triumph for their nuclear power industry, although it made for awkward optics as their American allies push an economic pressure campaign to isolate Russia over its war on Ukraine. South Korean officials said the United States was consulted in advance about the deal and that the technologies being supplied by Seoul for the project would not clash with international sanctions against Russia. According to South Korea´s presidential office and trade ministry, the state-run Korea Hydro and Nuclear Power was subcontracted by Russia's Atomstroyexport to provide certain materials and equipment and construct turbine buildings and other structures at the plant being built in Dabaa. The Mediterranean coastal town is about 130 kilometers (80 miles) northwest of Cairo. Atomstroyexport, also called ASE, is a subsidiary of Rosatom, a state-owned Russian nuclear conglomerate. The company has a contract with Egypt to deliver four 1,200 megawatt reactors through 2030. Korea Hydro and Nuclear Power's part of project is from 2023 to 2029. A senior aide of South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol said the negotiations were slowed by ""unexpected variables,"" mainly Russia´s war on Ukraine and the U.S.-led sanctions campaign against Moscow over its aggression.

(AP Photo/Ahn Young-joon, File) Choi Sang-mok, Yoon´s senior secretary for economic affairs, said South Korea provided an explanation to the United States in advance about its plans to participate in the Dabaa project and that the allies will maintain close consultation as the work proceeds. As part of U.S.-led sanctions against Moscow, South Korea has ended transactions with Russia´s central bank and sovereign wealth funds and banned exports of strategic materials to Russia. Neither Choi nor officials from South Korea´s trade ministry elaborated on how the crisis in Ukraine and the sanctions on Moscow affected the negotiations between Korea Hydro and Nuclear Power and ASE. Choi stressed that South Korea´s involvement in the project would not clash with international sanctions against Russia. ""Any kind of issue can be met by various uncertainties, but those have all been resolved as of now, and that´s why we were able to finalize the agreement,"" he said. Yoon's office expressed hope that South Korea´s participation in the Dabaa project would help the country gain a foothold in future nuclear projects across Africa and also improve its chances to export to countries such as the Czech Republic, Poland and Saudi Arabia. Korea Hydro and Nuclear Power had been engaging in negotiations with ASE as the preferred bidder for the turbine-related project since December, before Russia´s invasion of Ukraine in late February. Go Myong-hyun, a senior analyst at Seoul´s Asan Institute for Policy Studies, said the deal wouldn´t have been possible without an export approval by the United States as the components provided by Korea Hydro and Nuclear Power likely include U.S.-originated technology. Current sanctions against Moscow also do not include specific restrictions related to nuclear energy and the Biden administration would have no interest in disrupting a crucial project for Egypt, which it sees as a key partner in the region, Go said. While South Korea´s involvement in the Dabaa project wouldn´t immediately be a problem between the allies if the Americans signed off on it, things could change depending on how Russia´s war on Ukraine goes and whether Washington expands its export controls against Moscow, Go said. Yoon´s office said the Dabaa project is South Korea's biggest export of nuclear power technology since 2009, when a South Korean-led consortium won a $20 billion contract to build nuclear power reactors in the United Arab Emirates. Yoon, a conservative who took office in May, has pledged to boost South Korean exports of nuclear power technology, which he says were dented under the policies of his liberal predecessor, Moon Jae-in, who sought to reduce the country´s domestic dependence on nuclear energy. Yoon in a statement on Facebook said the deal reaffirms South Korea´s ""advanced technology and safeness and strong supply chains"" in the nuclear power industry. His government has set a goal of exporting 10 nuclear power reactors by 2030."

The move to increase the number of troops by 137,000, or 13%, to 1.15 million by the end of the year came amid chilling developments on the ground in Ukraine: - Fueling fears of a nuclear catastrophe, the Zaporizhzhia power plant in the middle of the fighting in southern Ukraine was briefly knocked out of commission by fire damage to a transmission line, authorities said. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the plant's emergency backup diesel generators had to be activated to provide power needed to operate the plant. ""Russia has put Ukraine and all Europeans one step away from a radiation disaster,"" Zelenskyy said in his nightly video address. - The death toll from a Russian rocket attack on a train station and the surrounding area climbed to 25, Ukrainian authorities said. Russia said it targeted a military train and claimed to have killed more than 200 Ukrainian reservists in the attack, which took place Wednesday on Ukraine's Independence Day. Putin´s decree did not specify whether the expansion would be accomplished by widening the draft, recruiting more volunteers, or both. But some Russian military analysts predicted heavier reliance on volunteers because of the Kremlin´s concerns about a potential domestic backlash from an expanded draft.

(AP Photo/Evgeniy Maloletka) The move will boost Russia's armed forces overall to 2.04 million, including the 1.15 million troops. Western estimates of Russian dead in the Ukraine war have ranged from more than 15,000 to over 20,000 - more than the Soviet Union lost during its 10-year war in Afghanistan. The Pentagon said last week that as many as 80,000 Russian troops have been killed or wounded, eroding Moscow´s ability to conduct big offensives. The Kremlin has said that only volunteer contract soldiers take part in the Ukraine war. But it may be difficult to find more willing soldiers, and military analysts said the planned troop levels may still be insufficient to sustain operations. Retired Russian Col. Retired Viktor Murakhovsky said in comments carried by the Moscow-based RBC online news outlet that the Kremlin will probably try to keep relying on volunteers, and he predicted that will account for the bulk of the increase. Another Russian military expert, Alexei Leonkov, noted that training on complex modern weapons normally takes three years. And draftees serve only one year. ""A draft won´t help that, so there will be no increase in the number of draftees,"" the state RIA Novosti news agency quoted Leonkov as saying. Fears of a Chernobyl-like disaster have been mounting in Ukraine because of fighting around the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia plant. Ukraine and Russia have accused each other of shelling the site. In the incident on Thursday, the plant was cut off from the electrical grid, causing a blackout across the region, according to authorities. The complex was later reconnected to the grid, a local Russian-installed official said. It was not immediately clear from Ukrainian energy authorities whether the damaged line carried outgoing electricity or incoming power to operate the plant. But Zelenskyy's mention of the emergency generators implied that incoming power was affected. Incoming electricity is needed to run the reactors' vital cooling systems. Zelenskyy said Ukraine would have faced a radiation accident if the diesel generators had failed to turn on. He blamed the fire that damaged the transmission line on Russian shelling. But Zaporizhzhia's Russian-installed regional governor, Yevgeny Balitsky, blamed a Ukrainian attack. While the incident apparently didn't affect the reactors' cooling systems - whose loss could lead to a meltdown - it stoked fears of disaster. ""The situation is extremely dangerous,"" Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said. ""I´m receiving reports that there are fires in the forest near the power plant. We still have to examine this issue more."" Elsewhere on the battle front, the deadly strike on the train station in Chaplyne, a town of about 3,500 in the central Dnipropetrovsk region, came as Ukraine was bracing for attacks tied to the national holiday and the war's six-month mark, both of which fell on Wednesday. The deputy head of the Ukrainian presidential office, Kyrylo Tymoshenko, did not say whether all of the 25 people killed were civilians. If they were, it would amount to one of the deadliest attacks on civilians in weeks. Thirty-one people were reported wounded. Witnesses said some of the victims, including at least one child, burned to death in train cars or passing automobiles. ""Everything sank into dust,"" said Olena Budnyk, a 65-year-old Chaplyne resident. ""There was a dust storm. We couldn´t see anything. We didn´t know where to run."" The dead included an 11-year-old boy found under the rubble of a house and a 6-year-old killed in a car fire near the train station, authorities said. Russia's Defense Ministry said its forces used an Iskander missile to strike a military train carrying Ukrainian troops and equipment to the front line in eastern Ukraine. The ministry claimed more than 200 reservists ""were destroyed on their way to the combat zone."" The attack served as a painful reminder of Russia´s continued ability to inflict large-scale suffering. Wednesday´s national holiday celebrated Ukraine´s 1991 declaration of independence from the Soviet Union. Tetyana Kvitnytska, deputy head of the Dnipropetrovsk regional health department, said those hurt in the train station attack suffered head injuries, broken limbs, burns and shrapnel wounds. Following attacks in which civilians have died, the Russian government has repeatedly claimed that its forces aim only at legitimate military targets. Hours before the bloodshed at the train station, Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu insisted the military was doing its best to spare civilians, even at the cost of slowing down its offensive in Ukraine. In April, a Russian missile attack on a train station in the eastern Ukrainian city of Kramatorsk killed more than 50 people as crowds of mostly women and children sought to flee the fighting. The attack was denounced as a war crime. In Moscow on Thursday, Dmitry Medvedev, the secretary of Russia´s Security Council, said Western hopes for a Ukrainian victory are futile and emphasized that the Kremlin will press home what it calls the ""special military operation,"" leaving just two possible outcomes. ""One is reaching all goals of the special military operation and Kyiv´s recognition of this outcome,"" Medvedev said on his messaging app channel. ""The second is a military coup in Ukraine followed by the recognition of results of the special operation."" ___ Follow all of AP's coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine A woman made up with wounds and with Ukrainian colors attends a so called Freedom March demonstration, marking the Ukrainian Independence Day in Berlin, Germany, Wednesday, Aug. 24, 2022.

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-11144871/UK-energy-bills-skyrocketing-Why-happening.html,2022-08-25,UK energy bills are skyrocketing. Why is it happening?,"A cost-of-living crisis in Britain is about to get worse, with millions of people paying about 80% more a year on their household energy bills starting in October. The U.K. energy regulator on Friday announced the latest price cap, which is the maximum amount that gas suppliers can charge customers per unit of energy. It means people will pay 3,549 pounds ($4,188) a year for heating and electricity. Scores are already struggling to make ends meet as inflation soared to 10.1% last month - the highest in 40 years - and the rapidly spiraling costs of energy and food are certain to hit the poorest the hardest. The government is facing widespread calls to do more to offer relief, but no new measures are expected before the Conservative Party chooses a new prime minister to replace Boris Johnson. Here's a look at the rising energy costs in the United Kingdom: HOW STEEP IS THE RISE? FILE - An electricity pylon is seen in Lydd, southern England, Monday, Aug. 15, 2022. A deepening cost-of-living crisis in Britain is about to worsen, with millions of people expected to pay more a year on their household energy bills starting in October. The U.K. energy regulator on Friday, Aug. 26 is set to announce the latest price cap, which is the maximum amount that gas suppliers can charge customers per unit of energy. It could mean people pay up to 3,600 pounds ($4,240) a year for heating and electricity. (AP Photo/Frank Augstein, file) Annual energy bills for the average household paying by direct debit have already risen by a record 54% so far this year. Bills had been capped at 1,971 pounds ($2,320) a year, compared with about 1,200 pounds last winter. Under the revised price cap announced Friday, average household energy bills will jump to 3,549 pounds a year starting Oct. 1. They will go still higher when the price cap is updated again in January, expected to exceed 4,000 pounds. U.S. bank Citi forecast that the huge energy cost increases could drive U.K. inflation to 18% next year. The Bank of England predicts a recession starting later this year. Charities and public health leaders warn that the rocketing bills will be a ""catastrophe"" for poorer people heading into winter, as growing numbers are forced to make impossible choices between heating their homes and putting food on the table. The energy regulator, the Office of Gas and Electricity Markets, said the quarterly update is meant to mitigate volatility in the energy market, allowing energy suppliers to better manage their risks so there´s no sudden cost hikes for consumers. WHY ARE ENERGY PRICES RISING? Global oil and gas prices have been rising sharply since last year as economies worldwide recovered from the coronavirus pandemic and demand for energy surged. Russia´s war in Ukraine created a full-on energy crisis as Moscow reduced or cut off natural gas flows to European countries that rely on the fuel to power industry, generate electricity and heat and cool homes. Shrinking supplies, higher demand and fears of a complete Russian cutoff have driven natural gas prices to record highs, further fueling inflation that has squeezed people's ability to spend and raised the risk of a recession in Europe and the U.K. ""The market shows no sign of finding a new equilibrium,"" Rystad Energy analyst Lu Ming Pang said. ""Market sentiment is a mixture of price record fatigue with quiet acceptance that this new normal is here to stay."" Although Britain only imports a small percentage of its gas from Russia, the U.K. relies more on gas than its European neighbors because it has less nuclear and renewable energy. It also does not have as much capacity to store gas, forcing it to buy on the short-term spot market that sees greater volatility in prices. WHAT IS THE GOVERNMENT DOING ABOUT RISING ENERGY PRICES? Officials say they have set aside a package of support worth 37 billion pounds to help with the cost of living. All households will receive 400 pounds off their energy bills this winter, and millions of low-income people will get a further 650 pounds. The measures have been widely criticized as inadequate, but no new policy is expected until after Sept. 5, when the Conservatives announce who they have chosen for a new leader. Some, including the opposition Labour Party, have called for officials to significantly increase financial support for people and to freeze the energy price cap. Labour proposed to pay for it by extending the government´s temporary tax on the windfall profits of oil and gas companies. Neither Liz Truss nor Rishi Sunak, the two politicians vying to become the next prime minister, appear to back such a plan. Some critics say the U.K.´s fully privatized energy market - which can be traced back to Margaret Thatcher´s liberalization drive in the 1980s - is partly to blame for the crisis. Giovanna Speciale, chief executive of the Southeast London Community Energy group, which helps people in need with their household bills, said the energy market is ""fundamentally broken."" Receiving ""400 pounds, or 1,200 pounds in government support is not going to help very much - these are just sticking plasters,"" Speciale said. ""What we need to address is systemic problems. Because the system is entirely private, there´s very little that the government can do to intervene in this."" HOW DOES THE UK COMPARE WITH EU NEIGHBORS? Energy prices are rising in other European countries, too, but people in some countries have not seen the same level of rocketing bills as the U.K. In France, gas prices are frozen at October 2021 levels, and the freeze has been extended until the end of the year following a government decree announced in June. Low- and middle-income households also receive 100 euros ($99.60) to buy gas and electricity. In Germany, average electricity prices for households rose up to 38% over the past year. A new levy to prop up energy companies buying more expensive natural gas would add several hundred euros for an average household per year. But the government is temporarily lowering taxes on natural gas from 19% to 7% to offset those costs and has approved one-off cash subsidies. Italy also has seen increasing calls for an energy price cap amid parliamentary election campaigns. This month, the government earmarked 8.4 billion euros to help low-income households and businesses offset the increase in energy costs, following relief it previously approved. ___ AP reporters Jade Le Deley in Paris, Geir Moulson in Berlin and Colleen Barry in Milan contributed."
https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-11144529/Frances-Macron-heads-Algeria-bid-heal-wounds.html,2022-08-25,France's Macron visits Algeria in bid to heal wounds,"French President Emmanuel Macron arrived in Algeria on Thursday for a three-day visit aimed at addressing two major challenges: boosting future economic relations and healing colonial-era wounds. The visit comes less than a year after a monthlong diplomatic crisis between the two countries stirred up tensions 60 years after the North African country won its independence from France. The war in Ukraine has reinforced Algeria´s status as a key partner in providing gas to the European continent. In recent years, Macron has made unprecedented steps to acknowledge torture and killings by French troops during Algeria´s 1954-62 war of independence, in a bid to improve the two countries' still rancorous relations. Yet the series of symbolic gestures has fallen short of an apology from France for its actions during the war - a longstanding demand from Algeria. ""We have a common past, we have a painful past, (...) but we want to build a future together,"" Macron said in a joint statement with Algerian President Abdelmajid Tebboune in the capital, Algiers. The two leaders agreed to form a joint commission of historians who will examine the past from the beginning of the French colonization in 1830 to Algeria's liberation in 1962. ""We will not take the easy way,"" Macron said and vowed that France will open up archives in the ""quest for truth."" He added: ""We did not choose and plan the past. We inherited it and we have to face it with humility.""

French President Emmanuel Macron is in Algeria for a three-day official visit aimed at addressing two major challenges: boosting future economic relations while seeking to heal wounds inherited from the colonial era, 60 years after the North African country won its independence from France. (AP Photo/Anis Belghoul) Earlier on Thursday, the two leaders attended a ceremony at the Martyrs' Memorial, which pays tribute to those who died during Algeria's struggle for independence, before heading to the presidential El Mouradia palace for a meeting and dinner. Tebboune said Macron's visit will ""energize"" the relationship between Algeria and France. Their ties are ""deep and diverse,"" but the two countries need more trade agreements nd an improved business climate in Algeria to build a stronger economy for his country's youth, Tebboune said in the joint statement after their first meeting. This is the second time Macron has been to Algeria as president. During a brief stop in December 2017, he called for a ""partnership between equals."" Months before that, during a trip to Algiers as a presidential candidate, he called colonization a ""crime against humanity."" Macron, the first French president born after the end of Algeria´s brutal seven-year war of independence in 1962, has promised a reckoning of colonial-era wrongs. The country was occupied by France for 132 years. In 2018, Macron recognized the responsibility of the French state in the 1957 death of a dissident in Algeria, Maurice Audin, admitting for the first time the military´s use of systematic torture during the war. He later made a key decision to speed up the declassification of secret documents related to the war, amid other gestures. Macron will have a second meeting with Tebboune on Friday in the presence of the French army chief and defense and foreign ministers to discuss peace and stability in the region, after France completed the withdrawal of its troops from Mali earlier this month. Paris still maintains troops in the broader Sahel region, with the heart of the operation moved to Niger. Coordination with Algerian authorities is crucial, as the country shares long borders in the Sahara with Mali, Libya and Niger, paths used by smugglers and Islamic extremists, the Elysee stressed. No energy supply or other big trade contract is expected during Macron´s trip, but the focus will be on future economic relations. Algeria´s status as a key gas supplier for Europe has been enhanced amid fears that Russia could cut off supplies. The North African country is the EU´s third-largest gas supplier, representing 8.2% of the 27-nation bloc's imports in 2021. Algiers has already started increasing its gas supplies to the continent, mostly via two pipelines that connect the country to Italy and Spain. It signed a $4 billion gas deal with U.S. group Occidental Petroleum, Italian company Eni and French giant Total. Tensions between the two countries escalated following a French decision to slash the number of visas issued to people in North Africa, including Algeria, because governments there were refusing to take back migrants expelled from France. Relations further worsened after Algeria recalled its ambassador to France citing alleged ""irresponsible comments"" attributed to Macron about Algeria´s pre-colonial history and post-colonial system of government. In retaliation, Algeria accused Paris of ""genocide"" during the colonial era. Both countries agreed to resume cooperation in December. The leaders discussed the visa situation during Thursday's meeting. There are several million Algerian citizens or people of Algerian descent in France. Before the trip, the Elysee said Macron will raise human rights issues, in a country where activists criticize an unjust system of governance that views dissidents as criminals and doesn't allow freedom of speech. On Friday, Macron will go to the Christian and Jewish cemetery of Saint-Eugene in Algiers. He will also visit the Great Mosque. He will then head to Oran, the country´s second-largest city, where he will attend Saturday a show of breakdancing, which will become an Olympic sport in 2024 in Paris. ___ Associated Press journalist Barbara Surk in Nice, France, contributed to this report.

The debate over what mark he left on his party, his country and the world will linger long after he departs in September - if, indeed, he really is gone for good. Johnson led Britain out of the European Union and won a landslide election victory before his government collapsed in a heap of ethics scandals. During his final appearance in Parliament as prime minister in July, he summed up his three years in office as: ""Mission largely accomplished."" Many political historians take a harsher view. ""Winston Churchill said that `History will be kind to me for I intend to write it,´"" said Tim Bale, professor of politics at Queen Mary University of London. ""I´m pretty sure Johnson does too, but I doubt he´ll find it´s as kind to him as it was to his hero."" Johnson cultivated a buffoonish public image, but he has had a serious impact on his country. He bears much of the credit, or blame, for Britain´s departure from the EU, a momentous decision whose consequences will play out for years. FILE - Britain's Prime Minister Boris Johnson addresses his supporters prior to boarding his General Election campaign trail bus in Manchester, England, Friday, Nov. 15, 2019.

Debate about what mark he will leave on his party, his country and the world will linger long after he departs in September. (AP Photo/Frank Augstein, Pool, File) ""The one certain thing you can say is that his legacy is Brexit,"" said Steven Fielding, professor of political history at the University of Nottingham. ""You can´t take that away from him - it´s just a question of whether it´s a good thing or a bad thing."" Johnson´s backing for the ""leave"" campaign in Britain's 2016 referendum on EU membership was vital to its victory. He had a popular appeal that no other campaigner could match. When wrangling in Parliament over the departure terms brought down Prime Minister Theresa May three years later, Johnson succeeded her with a vow to ""get Brexit done."" He led the Conservatives to a huge election victory in 2019 and took Britain out of the EU the following year. But the long divorce feels far from ""done."" Relations with the EU have soured amid unresolved disputes over trade rules for Northern Ireland. New customs and regulatory barriers are also hindering trade between Britain and the 27 EU nations. The benefits of Brexit touted by Johnson and other supporters - a chance to rip up onerous EU rules and create a more dynamic economy - have not yet materialized. Johnson´s promises to redistribute investment and opportunity to neglected regions of Britain also remain unfulfilled. His successor - either Foreign Secretary Liz Truss or former Treasury chief Rishi Sunak, who are competing in a Conservative Party leadership contest whose outcome will be announced Sept. 5 - inherits a deflating economy and a cost-of-living crisis sparked by such factors as Brexit and Russia´s invasion of Ukraine. Margaret MacMillan, emeritus professor of international history at Oxford University, said Johnson has left the United Kingdom weakened both economically and constitutionally. ""The Union is weaker, the status and future of Northern Ireland in question, and relations with the EU, which is still Britain´s major trading partner, (are) no better, if not worse, than when he became prime minister,"" she said. The other defining event of his premiership was COVID-19, which landed Johnson in intensive care in April 2020 and has left more than 180,000 people in Britain dead. Johnson hesitated before imposing a nationwide lockdown in March 2020; experts later said acting a week earlier would have saved thousands of lives. Britain went on to have three long lockdowns, a deep economic slump and one of the highest death tolls in Europe. But the U.K.´s vaccine program, led by a task force of scientists and businesspeople, is widely regarded as a major success. Victoria Honeyman, associate professor of British politics at the University of Leeds, said the verdict on Johnson´s pandemic record is in the eye of the beholder. ""His supporters would argue that his actions were beneficial and justified,"" she said, ""while his critics would argue that the actions were the bare minimum."" Apart from Brexit, Johnson´s main international cause has been Ukraine. He has been one of the most prominent allies of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, and Britain has backed up the rhetoric with billions in military and humanitarian aid to help the country resist Russia´s invasion. The support has made Johnson a popular figure in Ukraine, though critics say any other British leader would have followed the same policy. Johnson´s domestic policy achievements were few. His administration was chaotic, wracked by factionalism and constantly in crisis mode, as a lifelong record of bending and breaking rules finally caught up with him. He brazened out public anger at lockdown-breaching parties in Downing Street during the pandemic, for which he was fined by police. But his appointment to a key job of a politician who had been accused of sexual misconduct proved a scandal too far for Conservative lawmakers, who forced him out. Critics said it was a long-overdue comeuppance for a politician who debased British politics with his populist disregard for ethics and the truth. ""The tragedy is that whoever replaces Johnson will inevitably be someone who tolerated his mendacity, corruption and incompetence for years,"" Cambridge University history professor Richard Evans wrote in the New Statesman. ""The mess Boris Johnson has left behind will take a long time to clear up."" But another Cambridge historian, Robert Tombs, said Johnson might one day be seen as ""a much underrated politician"" -- especially if he publishes his own account of his time in office. ""The overriding theme will be that, though afflicted with human frailties, he was right when it mattered,"" Tombs wrote on the Spiked website. Johnson, 58, has tried to sound philosophical about his exit. ""Them´s the breaks,"" he said with a shrug as he announced his resignation on July 7. But he has made clear that he does not want to leave, blaming a ""herd"" mentality among Conservative colleagues for the ""eccentric"" decision to oust him. He remains a member of Parliament, and some Conservatives believe he could try to return as leader if his successor falters. Fielding said such a comeback would be almost unprecedented in British history. ""You´d think in a sane and rational political culture that would be impossible,"" he said. ""But that´s not what Britain is at the moment.""

The complex, Europe's largest nuclear plant, has been occupied by Russian forces and run by Ukrainian worker s since the early days of the 6-month-old war. Ukraine alleges Russia is essentially holding the plant hostage, storing weapons there and launching attacks from around it, while Moscow accuses Ukraine of recklessly firing on the facility. On Thursday, the plant was cut off from the electrical grid after fires damaged the last operating regular transmission line, according to Ukraine´s nuclear power agency, Energoatom. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy blamed Russian shelling and said the plant´s emergency backup diesel generators had to be activated to supply power needed to run the plant. ""Russia has put Ukraine and all Europeans one step away from a radiation disaster,"" Zelenskyy said in his nightly video address. Zaporizhzhia's Russian-installed regional governor, Yevgeny Balitsky, blamed the transmission-line damage on a Ukrainian attack. It was not immediately clear whether the damaged line carried outgoing electricity or incoming power, needed for the reactors' vital cooling systems. A backup line supplying electricity from another plant remained in place, Energoatom said. FILE - A man walks on a pedestrian crossing point near the Dnipro river and Zaporizhzhya nuclear plant on the other side in Nikopol, Ukraine, Aug, 22, 2022. Ukrainians are once again anxious and alarmed about the fate of a nuclear power plant in a land that was home to the world's worst atomic accident in 1986 at Chernobyl. The Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, Europe's largest, has been occupied by Russian forces since early in the war, and continued fighting nearby has heightened fears of a catastrophe that could affect nearby towns in southern Ukraine or beyond. (AP Photo/Evgeniy Maloletka, File) But Zelenskyy´s mention of the emergency generators being activated raised questions of whether the cooling systems were endangered. A loss of cooling could cause a nuclear meltdown. As a result of the transmission-line damage, the two reactors still in use out of the plant's six went offline, Balitsky said, but one was quickly restored, as was electricity to the region. Many nuclear plants are designed to automatically shut down or at least reduce reactor output in the event of a loss of outgoing transmission lines. The U.N.'s International Atomic Agency said Ukraine informed it that the reactors' emergency protection systems were triggered, and all safety systems remained operational. The three regular transmission lines at the plant are out of service because of previous war damage. ""Anybody who understands nuclear safety issues has been trembling for the last six months,"" Mycle Schneider, a consultant and coordinator of the World Nuclear Industry Status Report, said before the latest incident. Ukraine cannot simply shut down its nuclear plants during the war because it is heavily reliant on them. Its 15 reactors at four stations provide about half of its electricity. Still, an armed conflict near a working atomic plant is troubling for many experts and people living nearby. That fear is palpable just across the Dnieper River in Nikopol, where residents have been under nearly constant Russian shelling since July 12, with eight people killed, 850 buildings damaged and over half the population of 100,000 fleeing the city. Liudmyla Shyshkina, a 74-year-old widow who lived within sight of the Zaporizhzhia plant before her apartment was bombarded and her husband killed, said she believes the Russians are capable of intentionally causing a nuclear disaster. Zelenskyy has accused Russia of ""nuclear blackmail"" at Zaporizhzhia. F ighting in early March caused a brief fire at the plant´s training complex that officials said did not result in the release of any radiation. While no civilian nuclear plant is designed for a wartime situation, Zaporizhzhia´s reactors are protected by reinforced concrete containment domes that could withstand an errant shell, experts say. The more immediate concern is that a disruption in the electrical supply could knock out cooling systems essential for the reactors' safe operation. Emergency diesel generators can be unreliable. The pools where spent fuel rods are kept while they cool are also vulnerable to shelling, which could scatter radioactive material. Kyiv told the IAEA that shelling earlier this week damaged transformers at a nearby conventional power plant, disrupting the supplies of electricity to the Zaporizhzhia plant for several hours. The atomic agency's head, Rafael Mariano Grossi, said Thursday he hopes to send a team to the plant within days. Negotiations over how the team would access the plant are complicated but advancing, he said on France-24 television. ""Kyiv accepts it. Moscow accepts it. So we need to go there,"" Grossi said. At a U.N. Security Council meeting Tuesday, U.N. political chief Rosemary DiCarlo urged the withdrawal of all troops and military equipment from the plant and an agreement on a demilitarized zone around it. Speaking before Thursday's incident, one expert explained that power is essential to cool not just the reactors but also the spent radioactive fuel. ""If we lose the last one, we are at the total mercy of emergency power generators,"" said Najmedin Meshkati, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at the University of Southern California. He and Schneider expressed concern that the occupation of the plant by Russian forces is also hampering safety inspections and the replacement of critical parts, and is putting severe strain on hundreds of Ukrainian staff who operate the facility. ""Human error probability will be increased manifold by fatigue,"" said Meshkati, part of a committee appointed by the U.S. National Academy of Sciences to identify lessons from the 2011 nuclear disaster at Japan's Fukushima plant. ""Fatigue and stress are unfortunately two big safety factors."" If an incident at the Zaporizhzhia plant were to release radiation, the scale of the crisis would be determined largely by the winds and other weather conditions. The massive earthquake and tsunami that hit the Fukushima plant destroyed cooling systems, triggering meltdowns in three of its reactors. Much of the contaminated material was blown out to sea, limiting the damage. The April 26, 1986, explosion and fire at one of four reactors at the Chernobyl plant north of Kyiv sent a cloud of radioactive material across a wide swath of Europe and beyond. Zaporizhzhia's reactors are of a different model from those at Chernobyl, but unfavorable winds could still spread radioactive contamination in any direction, said Paul Dorfman, a nuclear safety expert at the University of Sussex who has advised the British and Irish governments. ""If something really went wrong, then we have a full-scale radiological catastrophe that could reach Europe, go as far as the Middle East, and certainly could reach Russia, but the most significant contamination would be in the immediate area,"" he said. That's why Nikopol's emergency services department has been taking radiation measurements every hour since the Russian invasion. Before that, it was every four hours. ___ Jordans reported from Berlin. Associated Press writer Edith M.

They come - tired, hungry, stressed out - for a respite and a cup of karak. Laborers stop on the way to work. Cab drivers linger after long shifts. Emiratis cruise by on midnight joyrides. A cup of milky sweet tea to ease the burden of the day, customers say, long priced at just 1 dirham, a bit less than 30 U.S. cents. But now, as supply chain shortages and Russia´s war on Ukraine lead to price spikes on everything from breakfast sandwiches in Manhattan to chicken tinga in Mexico, Dubai tea sellers are bumping up prices of what's informally considered the national drink of the United Arab Emirates. Moeen says he had no choice but to raise the price to 1.50 dirhams, or just over 40 cents. ""Everything got more expensive for us - milk, sugar, tea bags. Even the price of cups doubled,"" Moeen said from the one-room storefront in Satwa, a neighborhood bustling with South Asian workers on rickety bicycles that can feel a world away from Dubai's flashy skyscrapers. ""We also have to survive."" For nearly two decades, karak - an elixir of sugar, dehydrated milk and cardamom-infused tea - has largely been the same price, just one nickel-plated steel dirham coin. A dirham is worth 100 fils. ""It´s not about the 50 fils. They are making small, small changes,"" said Zeeshan Razak, an accountant from Kerala, India, sipping tea with his colleague. ""We are concerned about what it means."" An Indian tea seller who gave his name as Rafik pours karak in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, Wednesday, Aug. 24, 2022. Karak is the informal national drink of the United Arab Emirates, long priced at just 1 dirham, a bit less than 30 U.S. cents. But now, as supply chain shortages and Russia's war on Ukraine lead to price spikes across the world, Dubai's tea sellers are bumping up prices to 1.50 dirhams, or just over 40 cents. That's a blow to migrant workers who depend on the drink as a daily ritual offering respite and fuel. (AP Photo/Jon Gambrell) It was one of the rare treats that a dirham could buy in Dubai, which draws both the world's richest people and legions of low-paid migrant workers. ""It's part of its brand that it costs 1 dirham,"" said Abdulla Moaswes, a Palestinian karak aficionado raised in the UAE who's known for his scholarship on the tea. ""People stockpile the coins so they always have one on hand."" Oil-rich Gulf Arab governments have reaped a windfall since the world´s economic recovery from COVID-19 and Moscow´s invasion of Ukraine boosted global energy prices. But rising inflation has taken a toll. The price of another sweet staple in Dubai long worth 1 dirham, the McDonald´s soft-serve ice cream cone, recently spiked to 2 dirhams. McDonald´s UAE franchisee said it made the ""difficult decision"" due to a spike in ""operating, equipment, manpower and the raw material costs."" Residents are feeling the pinch. ""In the five years I´ve been here this is the worst time. Rent, food, petrol - I can´t catch up,"" said Arslan, an app-hired chauffeur from Pakistan´s Punjab province who drinks four cups of caffeinated karak daily to fuel his 12-hour night shift. ""There´s no way to cut back."" He gave only his first name for fear of reprisals, saying his landlord is threatening to call the police because he can´t make rent. Annual inflation in Dubai accelerated to a record 7.1% last month, with consumer prices growing fastest in food, transportation and entertainment, according to the emirate's statistics authority. Gas prices shot up nearly 80% from January to July - a shock for a wealthy petrostate that has long considered cheap fuel a birthright. To protect its citizens from cost pressures, the UAE announced it would nearly double the welfare budget for low-income Emiratis. But many of the country´s poorest people aren't citizens eligible for stipends, but migrant laborers from India, Pakistan and elsewhere toiling long hours for slim salaries. ""Inflation is an issue in the country, and it´s hitting segments of the expatriate population already operating on a shoestring budget,"" said Robert Mogielnicki, a senior scholar at the Arab Gulf States Institute in Washington. ""Small changes in prices ... can have a big impact."" Many are reminded of the impact each day - when they go for karak. At night, the empty lots and street corners of old Dubai fill with workers gossiping and scrolling through their phones over steaming cups. ""I´ll pay 1.50, fine, but it all adds up,"" said Anayeg Ula, a 29-year-old food delivery rider from Bangladesh, taking a karak break beside his bike. ""I came here to make money, not spend it."" Though modest in size, a cup of karak contains volumes in terms of the UAE's history. The oil boom of the 1970s brought millions of migrants to the Gulf Arab states, along with their tea preferences. Indians and Pakistanis building up the coastal emirates craved masala chai, but lacked the money to buy fresh milk and the time to slow-cook tea over a coal fire. They needed quick chai at the cheap that could be stored and served in vast quantities at construction sites. ""Karak was born from necessity,"" said Moaswes, the karak scholar. ""It´s what the economic situation allowed for decades ago."" The tea exploded in popularity over the years, becoming a social ritual - as well as an indispensable routine. The trend spread to Emiratis, who traditionally brew their Arabic tea ink-black but now claim the milky chai as part of their heritage. Dubai´s tourism authority promotes top karak spots to visitors. ""It´s nostalgic for me. That was breakfast on a daily basis, roaming around in our cars,"" recalls Ahmed Kazim, an Emirati who helped found a popular upscale karak shop, Project Chaiwala. ""It's the UAE culture. You'll see a guy with a bicycle pull up next to a Lamborghini."" The price of karak was 50 fils for a quarter-century, rising to 1 dirham in 2004 as Dubai rushed to build its booming desert skyline. Some fear that if prices continue to climb, the staple may be lost to the working class who created it. Shashank Upadhyay, a bakery owner in Dubai's old Karama neighborhood, tried to sell karak for 2 dirhams earlier this year. But he swiftly backpedaled after seeing his customers ""disturbed."" ""In this area, chai is too important,"" Upadhyay said. ""If we keep raising it, it will become something for people who go to high-end restaurants. But it's for local working people, like us."" ___ Follow Isabel DeBre on Twitter at www.twitter.com/isabeldebre.

""The Ukrainian heart is torn apart by the pope´s words,"" Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba told reporters in Kyiv after the Vatican nuncio was summoned. ""It was unfair."" He was responding to Francis' comments about the weekend car bomb slaying in Moscow of Darya Dugina, a nationalist Russian TV commentator and daughter of the right-wing Russian political theorist, Alexander Dugin, who ardently supports the war. Francis listed the ""poor girl"" killed by a car bomb in Moscow, as well as orphans in Ukraine and Russia, among the ""innocents"" who have been victimized by the ""insanity of war."" Russia has accused Ukrainian intelligence in the bombing, which Ukraine denies. Francis has denounced the war in Ukraine but has tried to keep a door open to dialogue with Moscow, refraining from condemning Russia, President Vladimir Putin or the head of the Russian Orthodox Church by name. His balanced approach has angered Kyiv, but it follows the Vatican's tradition of quiet diplomacy and refusal to take sides in a conflict.

Kirill has justified Russia's invasion of Ukraine on spiritual and ideological grounds, calling it a ""metaphysical"" battle with the West. He has blessed Russian soldiers going into battle and invoked the idea that Russians and Ukrainians are one people. Francis had confirmed as recently as last month that he would meet with Kirill at the Kazakh meeting, in what would have been the second-ever encounter between a pope and a Russian patriarch. The first was in 2016 and their second had been planned for June but was postponed over the diplomatic fallout of the war."
https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-11144207/Six-months-war-Russian-goods-flowing-US.html,2022-08-25,"Six months into war, Russian goods still flowing to US","On a hot, humid East Coast day this summer, a massive container ship pulled into the Port of Baltimore loaded with sheets of plywood, aluminum rods and radioactive material - all sourced from the fields, forests and factories of Russia. President Joe Biden promised to ""inflict pain"" and deal ""a crushing blow"" on Vladimir Putin through trade restrictions on commodities like vodka, diamonds and gasoline in the wake of Russia´s invasion of Ukraine six months ago. But hundreds of other types of unsanctioned goods worth billions of dollars, including those found on the ship bound for Baltimore from St. Petersburg, Russia, continue to flow into U.S. ports. The Associated Press found more than 3,600 shipments of wood, metals, rubber and other goods have arrived at U.S. ports from Russia since it began launching missiles and airstrikes into its neighbor in February. That´s a significant drop from the same period in 2021 when about 6,000 shipments arrived, but it still adds up to more than $1 billion worth of commerce a month. In reality, no one involved actually expected trade to drag to a halt after the invasion. Banning imports of certain items would likely do more harm to those sectors in the U.S. than in Russia. ""When we impose sanctions, it could disrupt global trade. So our job is to think about which sanctions deliver the most impact while also allowing global trade to work,"" Ambassador Jim O´Brien, who heads the State Department´s Office of Sanctions Coordination, told the AP. Experts say the global economy is so intertwined that sanctions must be limited in scope to avoid driving up prices in an already unstable market. Shipping containers are stacked together at the Port of Baltimore, Friday, Aug. 12, 2022, in Baltimore. Six months into the war in Ukraine, American companies - including federal contractors - continue to buy everything from birch wood flooring to weapons-grade titanium from major Russian corporations. (AP Photo/Julio Cortez) Also, U.S. sanctions don´t exist in a vacuum; layers of European Union and U.K bans result in convoluted trade rules that can be confusing to buyers, sellers and policymakers. For example, the Biden administration and the EU released separate lists of Russian companies that cannot receive exports, but at least one of those companies - which supplies the Russian military with metal to make fighter jets currently dropping bombs in Ukraine -- is still selling millions of dollars of metal to American and European firms, AP found. While some U.S. importers are sourcing alternative materials elsewhere, others say they have no choice. In the case of wood imports, Russia´s dense birch forests create such hard, strong timber that most American wooden classroom furniture, and much home flooring, is made from it. Shipping containers of Russian items - groats, weightlifting shoes, crypto mining gear, even pillows - arrive at U.S. ports almost every day. A breakdown of imported goods from Russia shows some items are clearly legal and even encouraged by the Biden administration, like the more than 100 shipments of fertilizer that have arrived since the invasion. Now-banned products like Russian oil and gas continued to arrive in U.S. ports long after the announcement of sanctions due to ""wind down"" periods, allowing companies to complete existing contracts. In some cases, the origin of products shipped out of Russian ports can be difficult to discern. U.S. energy companies are continuing to import oil from Kazakhstan through Russian ports, even though that oil is sometimes mixed with Russian fuel. Trade experts warn that Russian suppliers are unreliable, and opaque corporate structures of most major Russian companies make it difficult to determine whether they have ties to the government. ""It is a general rule: when you have sanctions, you´ll have all kinds of murky schemes and illicit trade,"" said Russian economist Konstantin Sonin, who teaches at the University of Chicago. ""Still, sanctions make sense because even though you cannot kill 100% of revenues, you can reduce them."" Many American companies are choosing to cut off Russian trade. Coors beer, for example, returned a shipment of hops to a state-owned Russian company in May as part of a commitment to suspend all business in the country, said Molson Coors Beverage Co. spokeswoman Jennifer Martinez. Russia and the U.S. were never major trading partners, and so sanctioning imports is only a very small slice of the retaliatory strategy. Restrictions on exports from the U.S. -- of technology in particular -- cause more damage to the Russian economy, and sanctioning the Russian Central Bank has frozen Russia´s access to roughly $600 billion in currency reserves held across the U.S. and Europe. Nonetheless, sanctions carry a symbolic weight beyond the financial harm they might inflict, particularly for American consumers horrified by the war. ___ AP Data journalist Larry Fenn in New York contributed to this report. ___ Contact AP´s global investigative team at Investigative@ap.org.

Bodø/Glimt, which spent much of the past two decades in the Norwegian second division, had been hoping to cap its recent rise by joining Europe's elite competition but lost in extra time to Dinamo Zagreb in the playoffs Wednesday. Dinamo joined Rangers and Copenhagen, which also advanced through their playoffs to complete a group-stage lineup stacked with 14 former former champions who have won 56 of the 67 European Cup or Champions League titles.

""It will be difficult to be equal to (Manchester) City, or Bayern or Liverpool. Maybe we will be lucky,"" Shakhtar captain Taras Stepanenko said this week. Shakhtar hosted eventual winner Madrid in Kyiv last October, and the record 14-time European champion is playing a record-extending 26th straight season in the group stage. Madrid has advanced every time. Here´s a look at the Champions League ahead of the group-stage draw starting 1600 GMT in Istanbul, Turkey. DRAW FORMAT The 32 teams from 15 different countries go into groups of four playing home-and-away round-robin games. Teams from the same country cannot be in the same group. The top two in each group advance to the knockout stage next year. Top seeds are the winners of last season´s Champions League and Europa League, Real Madrid and Eintracht Frankfurt, plus six winners of the highest-ranked domestic leagues. The other 24 teams are seeded according to UEFA ranking based on European results in the past five seasons. Liverpool is ranked highest of the 24 and Maccabi Haifa is lowest. WORLD CUP SCHEDULE Because the World Cup in Qatar starts Nov. 20, these Champions League groups start early on Sept. 6 and end five weeks sooner than usual on Nov. 2. Six rounds will be played in just nine weeks before a three-month pause until the round of 16 starts Feb. 14. That draw is on Nov. 7. Fixture congestion caused by the first World Cup played outside the European summer means the Champions League final in Istanbul´s Atatürk Olympic Stadium is on June 10. That´s the latest scheduled final - not including the August title game in the pandemic-hit 2019-20 season -- since the inaugural European Cup final on June 13, 1956. GO WEST The Champions League is even more concentrated in western Europe - and not just because of the Russia ban. Teams from Greece and Turkey in south-eastern Europe all lost in the qualifying rounds. Only Shakhtar, Viktoria Plzen and Dinamo Zagreb qualified from the old eastern Europe with Maccabi Haifa in Israel facing a 2,000-kilometer (1,250-mile) flight to its nearest potential opponent Napoli. Recent Champions League teams Dynamo Kyiv, Red Star Belgrade, Sheriff, Ferencváros and Qarabag all lost in the qualifying rounds. It means hundreds of millions in prize money flows to clubs in the already wealthier leagues of western Europe. PRIZE MONEY The 32 teams share about 2 billion euros ($1.99 billion) in UEFA prize money. Each team gets a basic fee of 15.6 million euros ($15.5 million), plus 2.8 million euros ($2.78 million) per win and 930,000 euros ($924,000) for each draw in the group stage. The extra 930,000 euros ($924,000) left over from each drawn game is pooled and shared among teams who won games. Payments increase through each knockout round. A fund of 600 million euros ($596 million) gets divided between clubs according to their place in a league table based on historical European titles and results in the past 10 years. The top-ranked ""coefficient"" team, Real Madrid, gets 36.4 million euros ($36.1 million) and lowest-ranked Maccabi Haifa gets just 1.14 million euros ($1.13 million). Teams also get a share of their domestic broadcast rights deal. UEFA deducts some cash to help repay broadcasters for games lost in the 2019-20 edition. It all adds up to the eventual champion getting around 125 million euros ($124 million) in UEFA prize money. SEEDINGS Pot 1: Real Madrid (Spain), Eintracht Frankfurt (Germany), Manchester City (England), AC Milan (Italy), Bayern Munich (Germany), Paris Saint-Germain (France), Porto (Portugal), Ajax (Netherlands). Pot 1: Liverpool (England), Chelsea (England), Barcelona (Spain), Juventus (Italy), Atlético Madrid (Spain), Sevilla (Spain), Leipzig (Germany), Tottenham (England). Pot 3: Borussia Dortmund (Germany), Salzburg (Austria), Shakhtar Donetsk (Ukraine), Inter Milan (Italy), Napoli (Italy), Benfica (Portugal), Sporting Lisbon (Portugal), Bayer Leverkusen (Germany) Pot 4: Rangers (Scotland), Dinamo Zagreb (Croatia), Marseille (France), Copenhagen (Denmark), Club Brugge (Belgium), Celtic (Scotland), Viktoria Plzen (Czech Republic), Maccabi Haifa (Israel). ___ More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports Dinamo's Bruno Petkovic celebrates with his teammates after scoring his side's second goal during the Champions League play-off soccer match, second leg, between Dinamo Zagreb and FK Bodo/Glimt at the Maksimir stadium in Zagreb, Croatia, Wednesday, Aug. 24, 2022.

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-11143145/Ukraine-leader-The-worlds-future-decided-Ukraine.html,2022-08-24,Ukraine leader: The world's future being decided in Ukraine,"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Wednesday that ""the world´s future"" is being decided in its war against Russia´s ""insane aggression"" and that maintaining his country´s independence is ""the security of the entire world."" He warned the U.N. Security Council on the six-month anniversary of the invasion that if Russia isn´t stopped, ""then all these Russian murderers will inevitably end up in other countries - Europe, Asia, Africa, Latin America."" ""There are traces of Russian war criminals everywhere and we must all get united and act decisively as soon as possible so there are no more traces of Russian missiles, and no more cities burned by Russian military - so that there would be no threat of the radiation catastrophe ever, ever again,"" he said. Zelenskyy addressed the U.N.´s most powerful body not only on the anniversary of the invasion but on Ukraine´s independence day, stressing the crucial link between what happens in the war to the future security and geopolitical architecture of the world. As his country celebrates its 1991 independence from the former Soviet Union, ""everyone can see how much the world is dependent on our independence,"" Zelenskyy said. He stressed the sovereignty and territorial of all countries and demanded that Russia withdraw from all Ukrainian territory it has captured and end its territorial ambitions. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy addresses the Security Council via video link during a meeting on threats to international peace and security, Wednesday, Aug. 24, 2022, at United Nations headquarters. (AP Photo/Mary Altaffer) Zelenskyy claimed Russia ""rewards murderers and encourages executioners"" and told council members that his government will introduce a U.N. General Assembly resolution to hold Russia accountable for the crime of aggression against Ukraine. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has called for a ""Summit of the Future"" next year and Zelenskyy said it would be symbolic to hold it in Ukraine, because ""it is on the territory of Ukraine that the world´s future is decided, whether we will have a future at all."" Zelenskyy spoke by video over objections from Russia´s U.N. ambassador, Vassily Nebenzia, who said council rules require leaders to be present in the council chamber at U.N. headquarters in New York to deliver a speech. He said the Ukrainian leader already had been allowed to give video addresses on two previous occasions because of special circumstances and should not be allowed a third time. The overwhelming majority of the 15-member council disagreed - 13 countries voted in favor of another video speech by Zelenskyy, Russia voted against it and China abstained. Guterres called the six-month anniversary of the Russian invasion ""a sad and tragic milestone,"" with no end in sight to the war. He pointed to thousands of civilian casualties, grave violations of international human rights and humanitarian law, millions of Ukrainians who have lost their homes and are displaced or refugees, and rapidly rising humanitarian needs as winter approaches. ""The consequences of this senseless war are being felt far beyond Ukraine,"" Guterres said. ""We are seeing new vulnerabilities emerge in a global environment already worn out by conflicts, inequality, pandemic-induced economic and health crises, and climate change - with a disproportionate impact on developing countries."" Guterres warned that the acceleration of already high food, fertilizer and energy prices ""has triggered a global crisis that could drive millions more into extreme poverty."" U.S. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield addressed Zelenskyy, saying the United States stands with Ukraine ""today and every day, and every Russian bomb that falls only strengthens our resolve to support your sovereignty and your independence."" Six months after the invasion, she said, ""Russia's goal is as clear as ever: to dismantle Ukraine as a geopolitical entity and erase it from the world map."" Nebenzia again blamed ""the Kyiv regime"" that came to power in 2014 - the year Russia invaded and annexed Crimea - for what many council members called ""the catastrophic consequences"" of six months of hostilities. To Western nations claiming Russia is threatening Ukrainian independence, Nebenzia said, ""the only threat to the independence of Ukraine is the current government of Kyiv,"" which he claimed makes no major decision without consulting Western advisers. He also accused Ukraine's government of suppressing the opposition, persecuting people for reading Russian language news, and imprisoning them for accepting humanitarian aid from Russia. After the meeting, Ukrainian Ambassador Sergiy Kyslytsya read a statement on behalf of 55 countries and the European Union denouncing Russia for its ""unprovoked full-scale and illegal invasion"" and deploring its failure to comply with U.N. General Assembly resolutions calling for an immediate halt to its use of force against Ukraine. With diplomats from many of the countries standing alongside, the statement read by Kyslytsa reaffirmed their solidarity with Ukraine, condemned Russian missile strikes that have killed civilians and destroyed civilian buildings, and reiterated their demand for an immediate cease-fire and withdrawal of Russian forces. Nebenzia was asked by a reporter if the media would be back for a one-year anniversary. ""I´m no fortuneteller,"" he replied.

Tensions between Serbia and Kosovo soared anew late last month when Kosovo's government declared that Serb-issued identity documents and vehicle license plates would no longer be valid in Kosovo´s territory, as Kosovo-issued ones are not valid in Serbia. Serbia does not recognize Kosovo's 2008 declaration of independence, and still considers the territory as its own. Kosovo Prime Minister Albin Kurti has said he was acting with reciprocity to the measures from Serbia. But Kosovo Serbs responded furiously, blocking roads in the Serb-dominated north of Kosovo. The incident has fueled fears of more unrest in the Balkans amid the uncertainties caused by the war in Ukraine. Kosovo has postponed the decision implementation until Sept. 1 as Washington and Brussels step up diplomatic efforts to resolve the crisis. U.S. envoy Gabriel Escobar and the EU's Miroslav Lajcak traveled to Kosovo on Wednesday and will move on to the Serbian capital, Belgrade, on Thursday. It was not immediately clear how close the two sides were to an agreement after the EU-mediated meeting last week produced no breakthrough. Kurti told reporters that the postponement by one month of the decision on license plates and identification documents was a ""good will gesture."" He added that the decision won't be changed and that either both sides will issue special travel documents for people going in and out, or neither will. There was no immediate response from Serbia, which has accused Kurti of pressuring the minority Serbs in the north, who mainly refuse to obtain Kosovo documents or license plates, defying Kosovo's statehood. Kosovo's independence has been recognized by Washington and most EU countries, while Serbia has relied on support from Russia and China for its bid to retain the former province. Belgrade lost control over Kosovo in 1999 after NATO bombed the country to stop its brutal crackdown against ethnic Albanian separatist rebels. For the past several years, the EU has mediated negotiations between Kosovo and Serbia to normalize relations, and move forward in efforts to join the European Union. NATO peacekeepers have stepped up their presence in the north of Kosovo in response to the increased tensions."

The removal of the memorial in Brzeg, in southwestern Poland, fell on Ukraine's Independence Day and on the sixth-month anniversary of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24. It is part of a longer effort to remove hated communist symbols from the public space in Poland and across the region. Poland, like some of its neighbors, was invaded and occupied by Germany and the Soviet Union at the start of World War II and then endured decades of Moscow-backed rule until 1989. The Polish state historical institute, the Institute of National Remembrance, has been working with local communities to remove dozens of similar Soviet-era memorials. Rafal Leskiewicz, the institute's spokesman, said that in March, when a decision was announced to remove them, there were still 60 standing. The monument in Brzeg mark's the 24th to be demolished. He said it was important to remove such memorials because of Russia's war in Ukraine, but also because a Polish law in 2015 calls for them to removed.

The work to dismantle the Brzeg monument is expected to last several days, he said. Poland, which lies on Ukraine's western border, has been a key ally to Kyiv, sending military and humanitarian aid into the war-torn country. It has also become a place of exile for more Ukrainian refugees than any other single country. The development in Poland comes after Estonia´s government last week started removing a Soviet World War II monument from near a city on the Russian border as part of a wider effort, prompted by Russia´s invasion of Ukraine, to dismantle remaining Soviet-era symbols.

The two Russian suspects are 25-year-old Mikhail Zorin, and 33-year-old Svetlana Timofoeva, while the Ukrainian was identified as Fedir Alpatov, authorities said. Alpatov's age wasn't provided. They were arrested on Saturday inside or near the former military plant in Gramsh, 80 kilometers (50 miles) south of the capital Tirana. The suspects had taken photos of the plant.

Timofoeva and Alpatov were arrested outside the complex. Police said they seized their Chevrolet vehicle, two drones, a laptop, cash and other evidence. The three suspects denied the charge of espionage. It wasn't immediately clear when a trial would be held. If they are eventually convicted, they face up to 10 years in prison. The Gramsh military plant opened in 1962 to produce AK-47, or Kalashnikov, rifles and other weapons. It stopped production after the fall of communism in 1990, and began to dismantle the weapons. The plant is still used to repair other military weapons, but there is no longer any production there. Local media reported that the three suspects entered Albania from different border entrances and then stayed near the plant. An Ukrainian Embassy official, who was present at the hearing, said the Ukrainian suspect was innocent, claiming that Alpatov only served as the Russians' driver.

About 1,000 workers marched to the Union Buildings, the seat of government in the capital Pretoria, calling for President Cyril Ramaphosa's government to contain rising prices. South Africa's economy is still reeling from the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in which an estimated 2 million jobs were lost, exacerbating the country´s 35% unemployment rate. Russia´s invasion of Ukraine has also hit South Africa's economy, with the gas price reaching record highs despite the government´s suspension of an increase in the fuel levy earlier this year. With South Africa's inflation now at 7.4%, the rising cost of living has been compounded by rolling power blackouts due to inability of the state-owned power company, Eskom, to generate adequate electricity. Eskom has applied for an increase in electricity prices despite it failing to provide an uninterrupted power supply for industry and households.

The fuel is used to heat and cool homes, generate electricity and run factories. Italy could be completely independent of Russia by fall 2024 if it installs two new regasification plants, he added. ""Our goal of diversifying from Russian gas was fundamental to giving citizens and businesses greater certainly about the stability of supplies,"" said Draghi, who resigned last month after key right-wing parties yanked support for his unity government. He remains in office until a new government can be formed following Sept. 25 parliamentary elections. Public resistance is growing to one of the planned offshore regasification plants near the industrial port city of Piombino, in Tuscany, and how plans proceed will be a key indicator of whether parties that win the Sept. 25 vote intend to continue Draghi´s path of reducing reliance on Russian energy.

Italy's push to rapidly reduce its dependence on Russian natural gas has made the country less vulnerable to an interruption of supplies, Draghi said Wednesday Aug. 24, 2022, noting that the country has stockpiled 80% of its capacity of gas reserves ahead of winter and is on track to hit 90% by October. (AP Photo/Andrew Medichini, File) Taking a swipe at right-wing parties that advocate sovereignty, Draghi said energy reliance on ""a country that never stopped pursuing its imperial past is the exact opposite of sovereignty."" His comments come as Russia´s war in Ukraine has driven natural gas prices to record highs, fueling inflation worldwide. Moscow has reduced gas flows to European countries as they try to bolster their reserves for the winter heating season, and fears are rising that deliveries could be cut off completely. That could lead to rationing by companies and push countries into recession. Germany said Tuesday that its gas storage is 80% full but warned that Russia's plan to halt flows through the Nord Stream 1 pipeline for three days next week ""could temporarily dampen"" the effort. Patrick Graichen, Germany´s deputy economy and energy minister, said Wednesday that he believes gas markets are already pricing in the possibility that Nord Stream 1 won´t reopen. Russia's state-controlled energy giant Gazprom said the scheduled downtime from Aug. 31 to Sept. 2 was for ""routine maintenance."" If gas doesn't flow again through the pipeline, then current prices ""are presumably the ones that market participants are already looking toward,"" he said. ""And that probably reflects the shortage we are in,"" Graichen added. ""We´ll need to see how we respond to that appropriately."" In Italy, Draghi again urged an European cap on natural gas prices, which has faced resistance among other EU member states. He told the audience in Rimini that fears Russia would cut off supplies in reprisal for any price cap were realized nonetheless this summer in periodic shutoffs to countries like Germany, which at the same time continued to pay ""exorbitant prices."" The prime minister also repeated his calls that the price of electricity generated by renewable energy no longer be tied to the higher price of natural gas. ""This relationship doesn´t make sense anymore,´´ he said. ___ AP reporter Frank Jordans in Berlin contributed."

""We mourn with those who have lost friends or family members, who have had to flee, have been taken from their beloved homeland or by Russian occupiers, who have lost their belongings to Russian bombs, rockets and artillery shells,"" the chancellor said. Scholz had harsh words for Russia, rebuking the Kremlin for its ""backward imperialism,"" and stressed that Ukraine ""will drive away the dark shadow of war because it is strong and brave, because it has friends in Europe and all over the world."" French President Emmanuel Macron, in a video message bookended with phrases he spoke in Ukrainian, said the defense of Ukraine meant ""refusing to allow international relations to be ruled by violence and chaos."" He said Ukraine's Independence Day ""is a day of pride. But in the place of legitimate festivities, we are thinking of the dead and the fighters today, of the courage and resilience of your people."" Finnish Prime Minister Sanna Marin adopted a similar tone, calling Ukrainians ""brave and unyielding."" She added: ""We stand with you. We won´t look away."" Ukraine offers a lesson that ""freedom and democracy will always win out over coercion and violence,"" Spain's prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, said. Pope Francis marked the half-year anniversary of the invasion by decrying the ""insanity"" of war and lamenting that innocents on both sides were paying the price. The pontiff warned about the risk of nuclear disaster in Ukraine, a reference to the shelling of the Russian-occupied Zaporizhhia nuclear power plant. He also lashed out at those who were profiting from the war, especially weapons manufacturers. Francis has stepped up his denunciations of the war, though he rarely blames Russia or President Vladimir Putin by name, evidence that the Vatican is trying to keep dialogue open with Moscow. In Poland´s capital, Warsaw, a few dozen Ukrainians, mostly women and children, gathered before a Ukraine community center and sang the national anthem. Many were dressed in embroidered folk shirts. Scores of people, including Portuguese politicians, attended a gathering in Lisbon, Portugal, by the city´s statue of Taras Shevchenko, Ukraine´s preeminent poet of the 19th century and a symbol of national renaissance.

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-11141213/Japan-considering-development-new-nuclear-reactors.html,2022-08-24,Japan considering development of new nuclear reactors,"Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida on Wednesday instructed his government to consider developing safer, smaller nuclear reactors, signaling a renewed emphasis on nuclear energy years after many of the country's plants were shut down. Kishida made the comment at a ""green transformation"" conference on bolstering the country´s efforts to curb emissions of greenhouse gases. Japan has pledged to reach carbon neutrality by 2050. Anti-nuclear sentiment and safety concerns rose sharply in Japan after the 2011 Fukushima nuclear plant disaster, but the government has been pushing for a return to nuclear energy amid worries of power shortages following Russia´s invasion of Ukraine and a global push to reduce greenhouse gases. The government, however, previously insisted it was not considering building new plants or replacing aged reactors, apparently to avoid stoking criticism from a wary public. Kishida's comment on Wednesday represents a sharp change from that stance. He said the panel presented proposals for the development and construction of ""new innovative reactors designed with new safety mechanisms."" He called on the government to speed up its examination of ""every possible measure"" and reach a decision by the end of the year. ""In order to overcome our imminent crisis of a power supply crunch, we must take our utmost steps to mobilize all possible policies in the coming years and prepare for any emergency,"" Kishida said. FILE - Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida speaks during a press conference at the prime minister's official residence in Tokyo on Aug. 10, 2022.

(Rodrigo Reyes Marin/Pool Photo via AP, File) ""It is extremely important to secure all options to redesign a stable energy supply for our country,"" Economy and Industry Minister Yasutoshi Nishimura told reporters. ""From that perspective, we will also consider all options regarding nuclear power."" Most of Japan's nuclear power plants were taken off line following the Fukushima accident for safety checks under tightened standards. A magnitude 9.0 earthquake and tsunami destroyed key cooling functions at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant in March 2011, causing three reactors to melt and contaminating the region with massive radiation that still keeps some areas uninhabitable. Japanese utilities have since set more than 20 reactors for decommissioning, largely because of the high cost of safety measures. Of the 33 workable reactors, 25 have been screened for safety checks by the Nuclear Safety Authority. Seventeen have been approved so far, but only 10 have restarted after gaining consent from local communities, including three currently off line for regular safety inspections. The government has already announced plans to speed up restarts and have up to nine reactors restarted by winter to cope with the energy crunch. It aims to restart seven other reactors after next summer and to further prolong the operational life of aging reactors to beyond 60 years from the initial 40 years. Some energy experts say so-called next-generation reactors, such as small modular reactors, could be costly and add a financial burden to plant operators. Toyoshi Fuketa, commissioner of Japan's nuclear watchdog, the Nuclear Safety Authority, told reporters on Wednesday that his agency's safety standards are not affected by the government's nuclear energy policy. Japan does not yet have safety standards for next-generation reactors and it would take more than a year to set such guidelines, while the safety of aging reactors needs to be carefully examined individually, he said. Critics say the true cost of nuclear energy would be much higher if the expense of radioactive waste management and final storage facilities are included, and that there are long-term environmental hazards of another Fukushima-like accident. They also say Russia's attacks on a nuclear plant in Ukraine show they are a potential security risk and need to be better protected. Tokyo Electric Power Company Holdings, the operator of the Fukushima Daiichi plant, has come under fire over lax safeguards at another plant, Kashiwazaki-Kariwa, where it is seeking to restart two reactors. The reactors are among the seven that the government wants to quickly restart. ___ Follow Mari Yamaguchi on Twitter at twitter.com/mariyamaguchi"

Police arrested Yevgeny Roizman, 59 who served as the mayor of Yekaterinburg in 2013-2018, following searches at his apartment and office. Roizman told reporters the case against him has been launched under a new law adopted after Russia sent troops into Ukraine on Feb. 24. He faces up to three years in prison if convicted. Russian courts fined Roizman three times earlier this year on similar charges, paving the way for a criminal case the law authorizes for repeat offenses. Roizman, a sharp critic of the Kremlin, is one of the most visible and charismatic opposition figures in Russia. During his tenure as mayor, he enjoyed broad popularity in Yekaterinburg, a city of 1.5 million in the Ural Mountains. Shortly after his arrest, a few local residents picketed in his support.

(AP Photo/Nataliya Vasilyeva, File) Cautious words of support also came from Roizman's longtime political rival, the governor of Russia's Sverdlovsk region. ""We used to be and continue to be political opponents. The law is the law. But, like any person, he deserves fairness and respect, and I hope he gets them,"" Gov. Yevgeny Kuyvashev said in a video statement posted on Telegram. While police escorted him from his apartment, Roizman told reporters that he would likely be brought to Moscow for investigation. Later in the day, his lawyer said that the politician was officially detained for 48 hours. Roizman said that the criminal charges against him were triggered by him calling the Kremlin's actions in Ukraine an ""invasion."" The Kremlin describes it as a ""special military operation."" ""I was saying that everywhere, and I will say it now,"" the politician added. Days after Russian President Vladimir Putin sent troops into Ukraine on Feb. 24, Russia's Kremlin-controlled parliament approved legislation that outlawed disparaging the military and the spread of ""false information"" about the military operations in Ukraine. Russian courts have increasingly handed out fines and, occasionally, prison terms to critics of Moscow's action in Ukraine. According to Net Freedoms, a legal aid group focusing on free speech cases, as of mid-August there were up to 4,000 administrative cases on charges of disparaging the armed forces. Another human rights group, OVD-Info, counted a total of 90 criminal cases on the charges of spreading false information about the military in the six months since Feb. 24. The group's report released Wednesday also pointed to 16,437 detentions for protesting against the military campaign over the past six months. Pavel Chikov, a leading Russian human rights advocate, said Wednesday that Russian courts have so far heard 3,500 administrative cases for discrediting the military and found most defendants guilty. All of them could face criminal charges like Roizman if they speak out again against Russia's operation in Ukraine, Chikov noted. Until his arrest, Roizman was one of the most visible opposition figures in Russia who had not been been jailed or fled the country under pressure from authorities. Two other prominent opposition politicians, Ilya Yashin and Vladimir Kara-Murza, were arrested under the same law as Roizman and face up to 10 years in prison, if convicted. Similar charges were recently brought against eight close associates of imprisoned opposition leader Alexei Navalny. All of them have left Russia after they became the subjects of multiple criminal investigations.

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-11140775/EXPLAINER-Where-Ukraine-war-stands-6-months.html,2022-08-24,EXPLAINER: Where Ukraine war stands after 6 months,"When Russian President Vladimir Putin invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24 in an unprovoked act of aggression, many expected a quick victory. Six months later, the largest military conflict in Europe since World War II has turned into a grinding war of attrition. The Russian offensive has largely bogged down as Ukrainian forces increasingly target key facilities far behind the front lines, including in Russia-occupied Crimea. A look at where things stand: A BOTCHED BLITZ When Putin declared the start of the ""special military operation,"" he urged Ukraine's military to turn against the government in Kyiv, reflecting the Kremlin's belief that the population would broadly welcome the invaders. Some of the Russian troops coming in from Moscow's ally of Belarus, just 200 kilometers (about 125 miles) north of the capital, reportedly brought their parade uniforms with them in preparation for a quick triumph. Those hopes were quickly shattered by fierce Ukrainian resistance, backed by Western-supplied weapons systems to the government of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

Russian offensive are largely stuck as Ukrainian forces increasingly target key facilities far behind the front lines. (AP Photo/Emilio Morenatti, File) Airborne troops sent to seize airfields around Kyiv suffered heavy losses and armored convoys stretching along the main highway leading to the capital were pummeled by Ukrainian artillery and scouts. Despite numerous attacks on Ukrainian air bases and air defense assets, the Russian air force has failed to win full control of the skies and suffered heavy losses, limiting its ability to support ground forces. One month into the war, Moscow pulled its troops back from areas near Kyiv, Kharkiv, Chernihiv and other major cities in a tacit acknowledgment of the blitz´s failure. SHIFTING BATTLEGROUNDS The Kremlin then shifted its focus to the Donbas, Ukraine's eastern industrial heartland, where Moscow-backed separatists had been fighting government troops since 2014 following Russia's annexation of the Crimean Peninsula. Relying on their massive edge in artillery, Russian forces inched forward in ferocious battles that devastated the region. The strategic port of Mariupol on the Sea of Azov that became a symbol of Ukrainian resistance fell in May after a nearly three-month siege that reduced the city to ruins. More than 2,400 Mariupol defenders who holed up at the giant Azovstal steel mill later surrendered and were taken prisoner. At least 53 of them died last month in an explosion at a prison in eastern Ukraine that Moscow and Kyiv blamed on each other. The Russians have taken control of the entire Luhansk region, one of two provinces that make up the Donbas, and also seized just over half of the second, Donetsk. Russia currently occupies about 20% of Ukraine´s territory. ""Putin will try to bite one piece of Ukrainian territory after another to strengthen his negotiating stand,"" said Mykola Sunhurovskyi, a military analyst with the Kyiv-based Razumkov Center think-tank. ""His message to Ukraine is: If you don't sit down for talks now, things will get worse and we will take even more of your territory and kill even more of your people. He's trying to raise not only external but also internal pressure on the Ukrainian government."" The Donbas offensive has slowed as Moscow was forced to relocate some of its troops to Russia-occupied areas in the south to fend off a potential Ukrainian counteroffensive. Russian troops seized the Kherson region, north of Crimea, and part of the neighboring Zaporizhzhia region early in the conflict. It has installed pro-Moscow administrations there, introduced its currency, handed out Russian passports and launched preparations for referendums to pave the way for their annexation. But Ukrainian forces recently reclaimed some ground, striking bridges and targeting munitions depots. Meanwhile, both sides have traded accusations of shelling the Russia-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Europe's largest, raising fears of an atomic disaster. ""Ukraine has forced Russia to conduct a massive redeployment of forces and spread them all along the front line, from Kharkiv to Kherson,"" said Ukrainian military expert Oleh Zhdanov. ""It's very hard to stretch them along such a big distance."" Although Kyiv doesn't have enough weapons to launch a big counteroffensive, ""time plays in Ukraine's favor,"" he said. ""The longer the pause lasts, the more weapons Ukraine will receive from its allies."" UKRAINIAN SUCCESSES Western weapons, including U.S. HIMARS multiple rocket launchers, have boosted Ukraine's military´s capability, allowing it to target Russian munitions depots, bridges and other key facilities with precision and impunity. In a major symbolic victory in April, the flagship of Russia's Black Sea Fleet, the Moskva missile cruiser, exploded and sank while on patrol after reportedly being hit by a Ukrainian missile. That dealt a heavy blow to Russia's pride and forced it to limit naval operations. Another big win for Ukraine came when Russian troops pulled back from strategic Snake Island, located on shipping lanes near Odesa, following relentless Ukrainian attacks. The retreat reduced the threat of a seaborne Russian attack on Odesa, helping pave the way for a deal to resume Ukrainian grain exports. Russia suffered a new blow this month when a series of explosions hit an airbase and munitions depot in Crimea. While Kyiv stopped short of taking credit for the blasts, there was no doubt about Ukrainian involvement. The Russians acknowledged that sabotage was behind one blast and alleged unsafe handling of munitions caused another - an explanation ridiculed by Ukraine. The explosions, which were followed by drone attacks, underlined the vulnerability of Crimea, which holds symbolic value for Russia and is key to sustaining its operations in the south. They demonstrated that Ukrainian forces are capable of striking far behind the front line, and Ukrainian officials warn that the 19-kilometer (12-mile) Crimean bridge, the longest in Europe, could be the next target. LIVES LOST AND DISRUPTED Both Russia and Ukraine mostly focus on the casualties they inflict on each other, avoiding mention of their own losses. But Ukraine's military chief, Gen. Valerii Zaluzhnyi, said Monday that nearly 9,000 Ukrainian soldiers have been killed in action. The Russian Defense Ministry last reported its casualties on March 25, one month into the war, when it said 1,351 soldiers had been killed and 3,825 were wounded. Western estimates of Russian dead have ranged from more than 15,000 to over 20,000 - more than the Soviet Union lost during its 10-year war in Afghanistan. The Pentagon said last week that between 70,000 to 80,000 Russian troops have been killed or wounded in action - losses that have eroded Moscow's capability to conduct big offensives. The U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights has recorded over 5,500 civilian deaths in the war, but noted the actual numbers could be significantly higher. The invasion has created the largest postwar refugee crisis in Europe. The U.N. refugee agency says a third of Ukrainians have fled their homes, with more than 6.6 million displaced within the country and over 6.6 million more across the continent. WHAT'S NEXT? The war's outcome will depend on the ability of Russia and Ukraine to muster additional resources. While Ukraine has conducted a mobilization and declared a goal to form a 1 million-member military, Russia has continued to rely on a limited contingent of volunteers, an approach reflecting Kremlin fears that a mass mobilization could fuel discontent and destabilize the country. Moscow has opted for interim steps, trying to encourage people to sign contracts with the military, increasingly engaging private contractors such as the Wagner Group, and even rounding up some prisoners for service - half-measures unable to meet the needs for any big offensives. ""Unless Russia mobilizes its population and mobilizes its industry, it cannot bring to bear the weight of people and industry in order to create a much bigger, more effective force, and therefore, it will have to consider how it hangs on to what it has already taken,"" retired British Gen. Richard Barrons said. Ukraine also lacks resources for any quick reclamation of its territory, with Barrons estimating it could take well into next year to amass a force capable of driving the Russians out. ""It can only do it if the West provides political will, money at about $5 to 6 billion a month, weapons like long-range artillery, the ammunition that supports that artillery and then enables the logistics and medical support that allows Ukraine to build a million-strong army,"" said Barrons, co-chair of the consulting group Universal Defence & Security Solutions. He said the West should be prepared to continue supporting Ukraine for a long time, despite soaring energy prices and other economic challenges stemming from sanctions imposed on Russia. Abandoning Ukraine, he said, would send a message ""to Russia and China and everybody else that the West does not have the stomach to stand up for its friends or even its own interests."" ___ Associated Press writers Danica Kirka in London and Yuras Karmanau in Tallinn, Estonia, contributed. ___ Follow AP's coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine FILE - An explosion is seen in an apartment building after Russian's army tank fires in Mariupol, Ukraine, March 11, 2022.

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-11140761/Ukraine-marks-Independence-Day-six-months-start-war.html,2022-08-24,22 reported killed in Independence Day attack in Ukraine,"Russian forces Wednesday launched a rocket attack on a Ukrainian train station on the embattled country's Independence Day, killing 22 people, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said after warning for days that Moscow might attempt ""something particularly cruel"" this week. The lethal attack took place in Chaplyne, a town of about 3,500 people in the central Dnipropetrovsk region, Ukrainian news agencies quoted Zelenskyy as telling the U.N. Security Council via video. The president's office also reported that an 11-year-old child was killed by rocket fire earlier in the day in the settlement. ""Chaplyne is our pain today,"" Zelenskyy said in his nightly video address to the nation. At one point, Zelenskyy put the number of wounded at about 50. The deputy head of Zelenskyy's office later said 22 people were wounded in the attack, which hit five passenger rail cars. Ukraine had been bracing for especially heavy attacks around the national holiday that commemorates Ukraine's declaration of independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. Wednesday also marked the six-month point in the war. Days ahead of Independence Day, Kyiv authorities banned large gatherings in the capital through Thursday for fear of missile strikes. People walk around destroyed Russian military vehicles installed in downtown Kyiv, Ukraine, Wednesday, Aug. 24, 2022.

(AP Photo/Evgeniy Maloletka) Residents of Kyiv, which has been largely spared in recent months, woke up Wednesday to air raid sirens, but no immediate strikes followed. As the day wore on, Russian bombardments were reported in the country's east, west and center, with the most serious attack apparently at the train station. Outgoing British Prime Minister Boris Johnson marked the holiday with a visit to Kyiv - his third since the war broke out - and other European leaders used the occasion to pledge unwavering support for Ukraine, locked in a battle that was widely expected to be a lightning conquest by Moscow but has turned into a grinding war of attrition. U.S. President Joe Biden announced a new military aid package of nearly $3 billion to help Ukrainian forces fight for years to come. Over the weekend, Zelenskyy cautioned that Russia ""may try to do something particularly nasty, something particularly cruel"" this week. He repeated the warnings ahead of the train station attack, saying, ""Russian provocations and brutal strikes are a possibility."" Nevertheless, a festive atmosphere prevailed during the day at Kyiv's Maidan square as thousands of residents posed for pictures next to burned-out Russian tanks put on display. Folk singers set up, and many revelers - ignoring the sirens - were out and about in traditionally embroidered dresses and shirts. Others were fearful. ""I can´t sleep at night because of what I see and hear about what is being done in Ukraine,"" said a retiree who gave only her first name, Tetyana, her voice shaking with emotion. ""This is not a war. It is the destruction of the Ukrainian people."" In a holiday message to the country, Zelenskyy exulted over Ukraine's success in fending off Moscow's forces since the invasion, saying: ""On Feb. 24, we were told: You have no chance. On Aug. 24, we say: Happy Independence Day, Ukraine!"" Britain's Johnson urged Western allies to stand by Ukraine through the winter. ""This is not the time to put forward flimsy negotiating proposals,"" he said. ""You can´t negotiate with a bear when it´s eating your leg or with a street robber when he has you pinned to the floor."" A car bombing outside Moscow that killed the 29-year-old daughter of right-wing Russian political theorist Alexander Dugin on Saturday also heightened fears that Russia might intensify attacks on Ukraine this week. Russian officials have blamed Ukraine for the death of Darya Dugina, a pro-Kremlin TV commentator. Ukraine has denied any involvement. Russian President Vladimir Putin's forces have encountered unexpectedly stiff Ukrainian resistance in their invasion and abandoned their effort to storm the capital in the spring. The fighting has turned into a slog that has reduced neighborhoods to rubble and sent shock waves through the world economy. Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu, speaking Wednesday at a meeting of his counterparts from a security organization dominated by Russia and China, claimed the slow pace of Moscow´s military action was due to what he said was an effort to spare civilians. Russian forces have repeatedly targeted civilian areas in cities, including hospitals and a Mariupol theater where hundreds of people were taking shelter. But Shoigu said Russia is carrying out strikes with precision weapons against Ukrainian military targets, and ""everything is done to avoid civilian casualties."" ""Undoubtedly, it slows down the pace of the offensive, but we do it deliberately,"" he said. On the battlefield, Russian forces struck several towns and villages in Donetsk province in the east over 24 hours, killing one person, authorities said. A building materials superstore in the city of Donetsk was hit by a shell and erupted in flames, the mayor said. There were no immediate reports of any injuries. In the Dnipropetrovsk region, the Russians again shelled the cities of Nikopol and Marhanets, damaging several buildings and wounding people, authorities said. Russian troops also shelled the city of Zaporizhzhia, but no casualties were reported. In addition, Russian rockets struck unspecified targets in the Khmelnytskyi region, about 300 kilometers (180 miles) west of Kyiv, the regional governor said. Attacks there have been infrequent. ___ Varenytsia reported from Pokrovsk, Ukraine. Associated Press writers Hanna Arhirova in Kyiv and Lolita C.

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-11140471/US-giving-Ukraine-3-billion-military-aid-years-ahead.html,2022-08-24,Biden announces nearly $3B in new military aid for Ukraine,"Six months after Russia's invasion of Ukraine, President Joe Biden announced Wednesday that he is sending $2.98 billion in new military aid to Ukraine that will provide longer-term weapons and training to enable forces there to fight for years to come. In a statement, Biden said the aid will allow Ukraine to acquire air defense systems, artillery systems and munitions, drones and other equipment ""to ensure it can continue to defend itself over the long term."" The announcement comes as Ukraine is celebrating its 1991 declaration of independence from the Soviet Union. ""I know this independence day is bittersweet for many Ukrainians as thousands have been killed or wounded, millions have been displaced from their homes, and so many others have fallen victim to Russian atrocities and attacks,"" Biden said. ""But six months of relentless attacks have only strengthened Ukrainians´ pride in themselves, in their country, and in their thirty-one years of independence."" The aid package is being provided under the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative, which funds contracts to purchase weapons and equipment. It includes money for the small, hand-launched Puma drones, equipment for the longer-endurance Scan Eagle surveillance drones, which are launched by catapult, and, for the first time, the Vampire anti-drone system, which can be launched off ships. In addition there is money for six advanced surface-to-air missile systems, known as NASAMS, munitions for them, 24 counter-artillery radars, precision rocket systems, and more than 300,000 rounds of artillery and mortar ammunition.

(AP Photo/Alex Brandon, File) As Russia's war on Ukraine drags on, U.S. security assistance is shifting to a longer-term campaign that also will likely keep more American military troops in Europe into the future, U.S. officials said. Unlike most previous packages, the new funding is largely aimed at helping Ukraine secure its medium- to long-term defense posture, according to officials familiar with the matter. Earlier shipments, most of them done under presidential drawdown authority, have focused on Ukraine´s more immediate needs for weapons and ammunition and involved materiel that the Pentagon already has in stock that can be shipped in short order. Besides providing longer-term assistance that Ukraine can use for potential future defense needs, the new package is intended to reassure Ukrainian officials that the United States intends to keep up its support, regardless of the day-to-day back and forth of the conflict. ""The United States of America is committed to supporting the people of Ukraine as they continue the fight to defend their sovereignty,"" Biden said. Detailing the package, Colin Kahl, the U.S. undersecretary of defense for policy, said the long-term focus of the contracting - which could be one to three years down the road - is a direct message to Russian President Vladimir Putin. ""His theory of victory is that he can wait everybody out. He can wait the Ukrainians out because they will be exhausted and attritted. He can wait us out because we´ll turn our attention elsewhere. He can wait the Europeans out because of high energy prices or whatever,"" said Kahl. ""So packages like this are extraordinarily important, indirectly challenging Putin´s theory of the case, which is that we´re not in it for the long haul."" Asked why there are no manned aircraft in the long-term package, Kahl said new fighter jets are not currently a priority. He said the Pentagon is concentrating on improving the capabilties of the Russian-made aircraft Ukraine already uses, such as installing high-speed anti-radiation missiles on them to better target enemy air defense systems. He added that providing fighter aircraft to Ukraine remains ""on the table."" NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg noted the more extended focus Tuesday as he reaffirmed the alliance´s support for the conflict-torn country. ""Winter is coming, and it will be hard, and what we see now is a grinding war of attrition. This is a battle of wills, and a battle of logistics. Therefore we must sustain our support for Ukraine for the long term, so that Ukraine prevails as a sovereign, independent nation,"" Stoltenberg said, speaking at a virtual conference about Crimea, organized by Ukraine. Six months after Russia invaded, the war has slowed to a grind, as both sides trade combat strikes and small advances in the east and south. Both sides have seen thousands of troops killed and injured, as Russia´s bombardment of cities has killed countless innocent civilians. There have been fears that Russia will intensify attacks on civilian infrastructure and government facilities in the coming days because of the independence day holiday and the war hitting the six-month mark. On Monday, the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine and the State Department issued a new security alert for Ukraine that repeated a call for Americans in the country to leave due to the danger. Other NATO allies are also marking the independence day with new aid announcements. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said his country is providing more than 500 million euros (nearly $500 million) in aid, including powerful anti-aircraft systems. The aid will include rocket launchers, ammunition, anti-drone equipment, a dozen armored recovery vehicles and and three additional IRIS-T long-range air defense systems, the German news agency dpa reported. The funding must still be approved by parliament, and some of it won´t be delivered until next year. And Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced $3.85 million for two Ukraine projects through the Peace and Stabilization Operations Program. It includes about $2.9 million in funding for ongoing development of Ukraine's national police force and other emergency services, and about $950,000 to help advise Ukraine's defense ministry. Including this latest package, the U.S. has provided about $13.6 billion in military aid to Ukraine since the beginning of the Biden administration, including 19 packages of weapons taken directly from Defense Department stocks since August 2021. U.S. defense leaders are also eyeing plans that will expand training for Ukrainian troops outside their country, and for militaries on Europe´s eastern and southern flanks that feel most threatened by Russia´s aggression. ___ Associated Press writers Lorne Cook in Brussels and Frank Jordans in Berlin contributed to this report. ___ Follow AP's coverage of Russia's war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine.

Dynamo´s first league game is on Sunday. Ukraine will have representation in Thursday´s group-stage draw in Istanbul through Shakhtar, which earned its place by being top of the Ukrainian league when it was abandoned last season because of the war.

Chinese Ambassador to the United Nations Zhang Jun, left, listens as Under-Secretary-General and head of the Department of Political and Peacebuilding Affairs Rosemary DiCarlo speaks during a Security Council meeting on threats to international peace and security, Tuesday, Aug. 23, 2022, at United Nations headquarters. (AP Photo/Mary Altaffer) DiCarlo called the situation in and around the plant ""dangerous"" and warned that if the almost daily reports ""of alarming incidents involving the plant"" continue or escalate, ""we could face a disaster."" Russia´s U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia told the council that since its last meeting on the operation of Zaporizhzhia about two weeks ago, ""the nuclear safety situation has further deteriorated."" ""The armed forces of Ukraine continue basically every day to shell the territory of the nuclear power plant and the town of Enerhodar and this creates a real risk of a radiation accident,"" he said. ""We expect that the IAEA trip mission will take place in the very near future and the agency experts will confirm the real situation at the station,"" Nebenzia said. ""We stand ready to extend maximum support possible to resolve all organizational issues."" Ukraine´s U.N. Ambassador Sergiy Kyslytsya welcomed the readiness of the IAEA´s Grossi to send a mission to Zaporizhzhia. He said earlier Tuesday Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba responded to Grossi's letter with the proposed IAEA itinerary saying it is in compliance with Ukrainian legislation ""and in general might be accepted."" ""Further arrangements are to be made based on the security conditions and require communication of detailed route plans and other logistical aspects as soon as possible,"" Kyslytsya said. Kyslytsya stressed that Ukraine would like to see the IAEA mission bolstered by incorporating ""military and political components,"" and having IAEA experts remain at the plant until it is returned to Ukraine. He also reiterated Ukraine´s demand for Russian troops to withdraw from Zaporizhzhia and for a demilitarized zone around the plant. After last week´s high-level meeting in the western Ukrainian city of Lviv involving U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and the presidents of Ukraine and Turkey, it appeared progress had been made on an IAEA mission to the plant. But there had been no sign of progress until DiCarlo´s announcement. DiCarlo told the council that the U.N. chief had discussed the issue of the plant´s safety during a phone call with Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu on Aug. 15, and with Ukraine´s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy during the Aug. 18 Lviv meeting. The Russian and Ukrainian ambassadors accused each other´s country of responsibility for the attacks in an around Zaporizhzhia. Nebenzia accused Ukraine of ""using nuclear blackmail"" by shelling the plant and called Western proposals for Russian forces to withdraw and to create a demilitarized zone ""irresponsible."" He said they don't take into account the need for the safe functioning of the plant. Addressing Western members of the council, he said: ""Once again, we appeal to you to stop covering up what your Kyiv protegees are doing and compel them to stop attacking the Zaporizhzhia (plant) which is fraught with risk of accident and radioactive contamination of European countries."" Nebenzia cited Russian Defense Ministry reports alleging Ukrainian shelling and said ""a whole slew of such photographic evidence"" was sent to Security Council members on Tuesday. He insisted that Russia has no heavy weapons at the plant, and that a ""disaster"" has been avoided because of the ""smooth joint work"" between the Ukrainian workers, fire squads, emergency people and Russian military. Ukraine´s Kyslytsya said Russia needs Zaporizhzhia to ""wage war"" against his country and accused Moscow of ""turning the issue of nuclear safety at the facility into a farce, a circus."" ""Nobody who is at least conscious can imagine that Ukraine would target a nuclear power plant at tremendous risk of nuclear catastrophe and on its own territory,"" he said. ""Such a catastrophe would lead to many deaths and pollution for many years to come."" Kyslytsya said Russia also needs the plant ""for propaganda purposes because the de-occupation of the plant will mean a failure of Putin´s campaign in the south of Ukraine.""

The outgoing U.K. leader created an arch of sunflowers - Ukraine´s national flower - outside his Downing Street office to commemorate the eastern European nation´s independence day on Wednesday. The gesture also comes as Ukraine prepares to mark six months since the Russian invasion began on Feb. 24. ""We will never recognize Russia´s annexation of Crimea or any other Ukrainian territory,"" Johnson said in a video address to an international summit on the Crimean Peninsula, which Russia seized in 2014. ""In the face of (Russian President Vladimir) Putin´s assault we must continue to give our Ukrainian friends all the military, humanitarian, economic and diplomatic support that they need,"" Johnson said. Johnson has been steadfast in his support for Ukraine since the invasion began. The prime minister, who will step down early next month, sought to deflect from scandals and criticism at home by positioning himself as the leader of the international effort to help Ukraine combat Russian aggression. Since the Russian invasion began, Johnson has pledged 2.3 billion pounds ($2.8 billion) of military aid to Ukraine, including armored vehicles and anti-tank missiles. He has also dispatched economic support, guaranteeing millions in World Bank loans for the country.

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-11139275/Unexpected-war-warning-Chernobyl-tours-camera.html,2022-08-23,Unexpected war warning system: Chernobyl tour's camera,"Months before Russia invaded Ukraine, Yaroslav Yemelianenko decided to set up a battery-operated camera showing his company´s tourist information center at a checkpoint near the Chernobyl nuclear power plant. Imagine his surprise when sitting in his Kyiv apartment on Feb. 24, his livestream showed dozens of Russian tanks driving south from Chernobyl, the site of the world's worst nuclear power disaster, toward the Ukrainian capital. ""In two hours, we saw a huge amount of Russian equipment on the cameras,"" Yemelianenko, the founder of Chernobyl Tour, said Tuesday. Russian troops shut off all official government surveillance cameras, but didn't notice the small camera Yemelianenko had installed to monitor his booth where his employees sold souvenirs and postcards to tourists. Chernobyl Tour had been taking tourists through the ""exclusion zone,"" the radioactive area surrounding the plant, showing them the facility, a nearby city the Soviets built to house workers and radioactive forests. Yemelianenko immediately decided to provide his video to the Ukrainian government. For several days, while the battery power lasted, Yemelianenko and colleagues monitored and transmitted data to the Ukrainian army every 10 to 15 minutes. A frame grab taken by the battery-operated camera placed by Chernobyl Tour to show the company's tourist information center near the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, shows Russian military vehicles rolling into Chernobyl, the site of the world's worst nuclear disaster, on the second day of the war, in the village of Dytyatki, Ukraine, on Friday, Feb. 25, 2022. (Yaroslav Yemelianenko/Chernobyl Tour via AP) ""Psychologically, it was difficult. On the one hand, we read the news with reassurance that no one would enter Kyiv. At the same time, we kept counting the number of (pieces of) Russian military equipment,"" Yemelianenko said in an interview. The stream of Russian military equipment just kept coming, all shown on the video monitor. Tanks, along with trucks carrying troops and communications equipment, stream along the gray road, past Yemlianenko's booth bearing a radiation symbol and his company's name, in English. So much Russian equipment was on the road that traffic jams developed on the way to Kyiv, 94 miles (150 kilometers) away. After a few days, the signal was lost. Russian troops had seized the power plant, scene of the April 1986 nuclear catastrophe. But Yemelianenko and his team had already developed an alternative - a network of informants in villages near Chernobyl. Even though Russian forces already occupied these villages, the locals risked their safety to provide Yemelianenko details on the positions of military equipment. Ukrainian forces subsequently took back control of the Chernobyl plant. With the passage of time and the military focus shifting elsewhere, the videos have made their way into the public domain. The video offers a rare, first-hand glimpse into Russia's earliest invasion moves, when the plan was to take Kyiv. Russian troops retreated from the capital in late March. Since then, Yemelianenko and his team have been volunteering in liberated villages to provide food and medicine. While the risk of additional radiation leaks has abated at Chernobyl, it has increased because of fighting near Europe's largest nuclear power plant, also in Ukraine, Zaporizhzhia. ___ Follow the AP´s coverage of the war at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine A frame grab taken by the battery-operated camera placed by Chernobyl Tour to show the company's tourist information center near the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, shows Russian military vehicles rolling into Chernobyl, the site of the world's worst nuclear disaster, on the second day of the war, in the village of Dytyatki, Ukraine, on Friday, Feb. 25, 2022.

Meloni, who has been buoyed for weeks by opinion polls showing her leading in her quest to become Italy's first female premier and its first far-right government leader, used the evening pep rally in Ancona, an Adriatic port city, to hammer away at long-running themes for her Brothers of Italy party, whose symbol borrows an icon from a neo-fascist party. She told the crowd of about 1,000 people in a town square there was a reason why she chose Ancona in Italy's east-central Marche region for her inaugural rally for Sept. 25 balloting for Parliament. ""I'm starting in Ancona not by chance,'' Meloni said, saying she did it so she can remind voters that ""we have a class of leaders ready to govern the country."" Introducing Meloni was Marche's governor, Francesco Acquaroli, elected in 2020 on the Brothers of Italy ticket, one of several local or regional elections where her party has gained popularity in the last years, sometimes at the expense of her right-wing ally, anti-migrant League leader Matteo Salvini. Meloni's main rival in opinion polls in the last several weeks is Democratic Party leader Enrico Letta, a former center-left premier. But while Meloni has center-right campaign alliances with both Salvini and with former Premier Silvio Berlusconi, Letta and his party have failed to forge similarly solid and broad alliances for the center-left. Right-wing party Brothers of Italy's leader Giorgia Meloni addresses a rally as she starts her political campaign ahead of Sept. 25 general elections, in Ancona, Italy, Tuesday, Aug. 23, 2022. (AP Photo/Domenico Stinellis) Salvini, Berlusconi and another populist leader, Giuseppe Conte, the former premier who leads the 5-Star Movement, sunk the national unity government of Premier Mario Draghi last month when they refused to back him in a confidence vote. Often shouting, Meloni proclaimed that the political right is ""ready to give answers to the country that the left hasn't been able to do"" for years. She contended that the European Union had failed to craft policies that would ensure available, affordable energy supplies. Sky-high energy prices ""have forced businesses and families down to their knees,"" Meloni said. While Salvini and Berlusconi in their campaigns have called for reactivating Italy's long-shuttered nuclear power plants, Meloni at the rally said Italy should exploit gas resources in the Adriatic Sea and not just look to buy gas from countries like Algeria, as Draghi has done, to wean Italians from supplies from Russia, given that country's war against Ukraine. Meloni has called for naval blockades in the Mediterranean to foil migrant smugglers from launching unseaworthy vessels from Libya toward Italy's shores. Noting most migrants who reach Italy that way aren't eligible for asylum, Meloni said they only wind up being exploited to work for low wages and in poor conditions by profit-hungry corporations - employment conditions ""that Italians don't want."" At other public appearances, Meloni has slammed what she calls the LGBTQ lobby, but she made no mention of that stance at the rally. Still, her past words have alarmed rights advocates in Italy. Matteo Marchegiani, leader of the Ancona chapter of Arcigay, a nationwide advocacy organization, told The Associated Press that he was very worried Meloni and her party could win a majority. Such an election victory ""could lead to the cancellation of the few civil rights that the LGBTQ community as a civil rights movement has obtained after decades of work and great effort"" in Italy, he said. Italy doesn't permit same-sex marriage. Right-wing and pro-Vatican politicians in recent years have thwarted passage of legislation, promoted by the Democrats, for hate crime protection for the LGBTQ community. A few protesters rallied near the square where Meloni spoke, with one of them holding a sign contending the leader foments hate. ___ Frances D'Emilio reported from Rome.

Kira Yarmysh, Navalny's spokeswoman, said on the Telegram messaging app that she and the seven others are accused in connection with their comments on a YouTube channel about the alleged bombing of Ukrainian civilians by Russian soldiers and calls to set fire to Russian military enlistment offices. Navalny was arrested in Russia in January 2021 upon returning from Germany, where he had been recuperating from nerve-agent poisoning he blames on the Kremlin. He was given a 2½-year sentence for a parole violation. In March, Navalny was sentenced to nine years in prison on charges of fraud and contempt of court, allegations he rejected as politically motivated and an attempt by the authorities to keep him behind bars for as long as possible. Earlier this month, Navalny said prison officials ordered him to serve at least three days in solitary confinement, citing a minor infraction, in retaliation for his activism behind bars."
https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-11138729/US-send-3-billion-aid-Ukraine-war-hits-6-months.html,2022-08-23,US to send $3 billion in aid to Ukraine as war hits 6 months,"As Russia's war on Ukraine drags on, U.S. security assistance is shifting to a longer-term campaign that will likely keep more American military troops in Europe into the future, including imminent plans to announce an additional roughly $3 billion in aid to train and equip Ukrainian forces to fight for years to come, U.S. officials said. U.S. officials told The Associated Press that the package is expected to be announced Wednesday, the day the war hits the six-month mark and Ukraine celebrates its independence day. The money will fund contracts for as many as three types of drones, and other weapons, ammunition and equipment that may not see the battlefront for a year or two, they said. The total of the aid package - which is being provided under the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative and is the largest to date- could change a bit overnight, but not likely by much. Officials said that it will include money for the small, hand-launched Puma drones, the longer-endurance Scan Eagle surveillance drones, which are launched by catapult, and, for the first time, the British Vampire drone system, which can be launched off ships. Several officials spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the aid before its public release. Unlike most previous packages, the new funding is largely aimed at helping Ukraine secure its medium- to long-term defense posture, according to the officials familiar with the matter. Earlier shipments, most of them done under Presidential Drawdown Authority, have focused on Ukraine´s more immediate needs for weapons and ammunition and involved materiel that the Pentagon already has in stock that can be shipped in short order. In addition to providing longer-term assistance that Ukraine can use for potential future defense needs, the new package is intended to reassure Ukrainian officials that the United States intends to keep up its support, regardless of the day-to-day back and forth of the conflict, the officials said.

They say a new aid package to be announced includes an additional roughly $3 billion to train and equip Ukrainian forces to fight for years to come. (AP Photo/Alex Brandon, File) NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg noted the more extended focus Tuesday as he reaffirmed the alliance´s support for the conflict-torn country. ""Winter is coming, and it will be hard, and what we see now is a grinding war of attrition. This is a battle of wills, and a battle of logistics. Therefore we must sustain our support for Ukraine for the long term, so that Ukraine prevails as a sovereign, independent nation,"" Stoltenberg said, speaking at a virtual conference about Crimea, organized by Ukraine. Six months after Russia invaded, the war has slowed to a grind, as both sides trade combat strikes and small advances in the east and south. Both sides have seen thousands of troops killed and injured, as Russia´s bombardment of cities has killed countless innocent civilians. There are fears that Russia will intensify attacks on civilian infrastructure and government facilities in Ukraine in the coming days because of the independence holiday and the six-month anniversary of the invasion. Late Monday, the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine and the State Department issued a new security alert for Ukraine that repeated a call for Americans in the country to leave due to the danger. ""Given Russia´s track record in Ukraine, we are concerned about the continued threat that Russian strikes pose to civilians and civilian infrastructure,"" it said. Other NATO allies are also marking the independence day with new aid announcements. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said his country is providing more than 500 million euros (nearly $500 million) in aid, including powerful anti-aircraft systems. The aid will also include rocket launchers, ammunition, anti-drone equipment, a dozen armored recovery vehicles and and three additional IRIS-T long-range air defense systems, the German news agency dpa reported. The funding must still be approved by parliament, and some of it won´t be delivered until next year. And Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced $3.85 million for two Ukraine projects through the Peace and Stabilization Operations Program. It includes about $2.9 million in funding for ongoing development of Ukraine's national police force and other emergency services, and about $950,000 to help advise Ukraine's defense ministry. To date, the U.S. has provided about $10.6 billion in military aid to Ukraine since the beginning of the Biden administration, including 19 packages of weapons taken directly from Defense Department stocks since August 2021. U.S. defense leaders are also eyeing plans that will expand training for Ukrainian troops outside their country, and for militaries on Europe´s eastern and southern flanks that feel most threatened by Russia´s aggression. ___ Associated Press writer Lorne Cook in Brussels contributed to this report.

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-11138699/How-tiny-volunteer-nonprofit-raised-57-million-Ukraine.html,2022-08-23,"How tiny, volunteer nonprofit raised $57 million for Ukraine","Kateryna Terekhova proudly shows off the new shelter she has created inside an abandoned schoolhouse in Zakarpattia, Ukraine, an area near the border with Slovakia, Romania, and Hungary. Over a video call, she points out the separate communal rooms for men, women, and families. The dozens of beds have brand new mattresses and linens. The bathrooms and showers are new, too. She loves the kitchen, which churns out three free meals a day for residents. People lounge on beds; a girl is scrunched up on a bench in the dining room, staring at her phone. Outside it´s quiet in this rural area - a relatively safe reprieve for people who have fled the terror of the Russian invasion. Terekhova fled here herself with her extended family from Kyiv in the opening days of the war and almost immediately began working on ways to help. As soon as she saw the schoolhouse, she knew it would make a perfect shelter. But it would require work - it had been empty for four years and had no plumbing or central heat. She was part of a chat group with IT Troops, a group of Ukrainian technology workers and entrepreneurs who help get supplies to troops and fund humanitarian work. They put Terekhova in charge of their humanitarian efforts. The group had been in contact with Razom for Ukraine, a U.S.-based charity run by Ukrainian and Ukrainian American volunteers. Over a video call with some of Razom´s board members, Terekhova explained the project and provided expected costs for materials - she had already raised the funds to cover the discounted labor and ongoing expenses like food. Three days later, she got a message from Razom congratulating her on her grant for $28,000, enough to cover all of the materials. ""It was absolutely shocking,"" Terekhova says. ""It was happening so fast. It was easy because we absolutely understand each other."" In this undated photo, volunteers unload supplies at a shelter in Zakarpattia, Ukraine. . The shelter was built in an abandoned schoolhouse, in part with funds from Razom for Ukraine. (Courtesy of Kateryna Terekhova via AP) Razom has made more than $3 million in grants to 98 small humanitarian efforts like this one since Russia invaded Ukraine in late February. The nonprofit´s deep ties to Ukraine have helped it connect with grassroots efforts that would likely be overlooked by big aid groups. The tiny, volunteer-led group is now working at a frantic pace. Every day, its leaders and volunteers know that the work they do can mean the difference between life and death for someone in Ukraine. For most of its eight-year history, Razom raised about $150,000 a year to help promote a free and prosperous Ukraine. Before the war, it had about 4,000 donors. But in the months since the invasion, Razom has raised $57 million from more than 150,000 donors. It has already spent $38 million on humanitarian relief efforts. One of its major projects: buying supplies to assemble and ship tactical medical kits to Ukraine. The group has sent 62,000 kits so far - with more to come. Razom has outraised some large, well-established humanitarian aid groups. Project Hope, an international nonprofit that is training medical professionals in Ukraine on trauma care, has received more than $21 million for the crisis. ""To raise $57 million for Ukraine and to be able to program such a large amount, that´s really fantastic,"" says Project Hope CEO Rabih Torbay. While Russian troops were amassing on the border, Razom´s board decided that in the event of an invasion, it would focus on medical assistance. The group began buying supplies to create tactical first-aid kits that include important supplies like tourniquets. Medical professionals volunteered to vet the supplies to make sure they were the right type and quality. Teams of volunteers put the kits together in a New Jersey warehouse. Volunteer software developers created a system to track the kits so the group knows where they are in the transit process and when they arrive at their destination in Ukraine. Corporations helped them find space on cargo planes for their supplies; a shipping company helped with logistics. Shipments that might have taken months took just days. Slow shipments could be deadly, and volunteers were working around the clock. ""This is our country and our people,"" says Dora Chomiak, Razom´s president. ""We want to make sure that they´re alive and that there is a country to come back to and there´s a country for our children and our grandchildren."" Handling the wave of donations has been as complicated as shipping supplies. When the group was founded, it tracked donations on an online spreadsheet. But it soon upgraded and put systems in place to process donations given online and through social-media channels. That made a big difference when Russia invaded and money poured in. Maria Genkin, a board member who until this year mostly organized cultural events, took charge of the fundraising operation. She had worked in investment-banking technology at Goldman Sachs. In late February, the group started getting hundreds of emails a day asking how to give, about wire-transfer information, and other questions - far more than one person could handle. Luckily, the group also got requests every day from people looking to volunteer. Genkin checked the backgrounds of some volunteers to create a trusted team to help potential donors, process incoming funds, and tackle the data entry required to track donors. She ended up with a team of six or so volunteers, including some Ukrainian students from nearby New York University. Razom has received some high-profile donations: Tipper Gore, Netflix co-founder Reed Hastings, and Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey each gave $1 million. The New York Jets donated $100,000. This summer, 27-year-old Razom board member Maryna Prykhodko traveled to Kharkiv to evacuate her aunt and uncle and bring them to the United States. Each night, as missiles fell from the sky, they huddled in her aunt and uncle´s closet for safety. ""I saw the destruction with my own eyes. You crawl out of your hiding place in the morning. You go out into the street, and you see that a new building has been destroyed,"" Prykhodko says. ""I was experiencing what Ukrainians had been experiencing."" She visited the warehouse where Razom stores supplies when they arrive in Ukraine. There, volunteers take requests from hospitals, first responders, and military units. About 20 drivers then take the supplies all over the country. While there, she traveled with one of the groups Razom funds to deliver aid to small towns near the border with Russia that had been liberated only a few weeks earlier after months of occupation. The locals she met were mostly people who couldn´t easily flee: They were elderly or disabled or had young children. They didn´t even flinch at the nearby shelling, Prykhodko says. Some were living in homes that had been destroyed except for a single room and lacked a kitchen or bathroom. ""There´s a missile sticking out of their house, and they don´t have a roof over their heads, but that´s what they have left,"" she says. ""They´re all traumatized."" Chomiak, Razom´s president, says the organization is already planning for the future. ""Once the bombing stops, there is going to continue to be a lot of work to do."" _____ This article was provided to The Associated Press by the Chronicle of Philanthropy.

Jimmie Akesson, who for almost two decades has sought to move his party from the far-right fringe toward the mainstream, has joined forces with a center-right opposition bloc in a bid to unseat the Social Democratic minority government led by Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson. Akesson´s party already has had a significant impact on politics in Sweden. Both the center-left government and the opposition in recent years have adopted tougher stances on crime and immigration - core issues for the Sweden Democrats. ""Fundamentally, it is a good thing. We want to change society. We want to make things better. So we welcome when other parties adopt our policies,"" Akesson, 43, told The Associated Press after a campaign speech Monday in the southern city of Helsingborg. Because of its far-right roots, Akesson´s party was treated as a pariah by all other parties when it first entered parliament in 2010. The Sweden Democrats were seen as a threat to fundamental values in Swedish society, including tolerance toward asylum-seekers from conflict zones in the Middle East and Africa. But the debate on migration has shifted amid growing concerns about how well some immigrants are integrating, increasingly segregated cities and a rise in gang violence.

The long-time leader of the nationalist Sweden Democrats says he's hoping for a stronger role as a ""blowtorch"" in Swedish politics after Sept. 11 elections, even if he doesn't get a seat in the next government. (AP Photo/Kongshaug Productions) After losing two consecutive elections, three of Sweden´s four center-right parties are now campaigning to form a government with the support of the Sweden Democrats after the Sept. 11 vote and making similar promises of longer prison terms for violent criminals and more restrictive policies for asylum-seekers. Polls show the the opposition neck-and-neck with a center-left bloc led by the Social Democrats. The Sweden Democrats are polling around 18%-19%, slightly better than the party's 2018 election result of 17.5% of the vote. Akesson told the AP that while he would prefer to be in government, he´s not at this stage demanding Cabinet seats if the center-right opposition win the election - as long as he can wield influence from the outside as a ""blow torch, a watchdog that makes sure that they actually carry through"" on their promises. His party, which says it rejects fascism and Nazism, recently published a study into the roots of the Sweden Democrats. Swedish newspaper Expressen revealed the author was a party member. Nonetheless, the investigation confirmed that several of the party´s founders in the 1980s had links to fascist and neo-Nazi movements. Akesson said it was good to get an ""academic"" review of the party´s past, though he thinks the results were of limited political value since the party´s origins were already well known. ""Those who founded our party are no longer taking part,"" he told the AP. ""Most of them disappeared already after one or two years. So the Sweden Democrats today is something different from what was founded about 30 years ago."" Akesson joined the Sweden Democrats in the mid-'90s and took over as party leader in 2005. He softened the party´s image, changed its official logo from a torch to a flower and expelled the most radical members. But critics say the party´s roots shine through in the rhetoric of its top officials. Social Democratic and center-right officials criticized the party´s spokesman on criminal justice issues, Tobias Andersson, last week for a tweet regarding the Sweden Democrats' campaign advertisement on the Stockholm subway. Posting a picture of a train car covered in the party logo, Andersson wrote: ""Welcome to the repatriation train. You have a one-way ticket. Next stop, Kabul."" Andersson refused to apologize for the tweet, saying it was mocking those who were offended by the party´s campaign posters. Social Democratic Justice Minister Morgan Johansson responded that the tweet showed the true nature of the group that center-right parties were trying to form a government with. Like many far-right and right-wing populist parties in Europe, the Sweden Democrats have also been accused of sympathies toward Russian President Vladimir Putin. A week before the Ukraine invasion, when asked in an interview with public broadcaster SVT which leader he preferred - U.S. President Joe Biden or Putin - Akesson replied ""it depends on the context."" Speaking Monday, Akesson said the party´s line on Putin's government was clear. ""We said 12 years ago when we entered Parliament that we must build up the armed forces because Putin is getting more and more aggressive, and then other parties said that´s not necessary,"" he said. ""Today, Russia is more or less a full-scale dictatorship that in addition is carrying out crimes against international law against its neighbors."" The Sweden Democrats used to be skeptical toward NATO membership but, like the governing Social Democrats, turned in favor of joining the alliance together with neighboring Finland after Russia´s invasion of Ukraine. The NATO application is undergoing a ratification process and is not an issue in the election. ___ Associated Press contributor Anders Kongshaug in Copenhagen contributed to this report.

Greece is one of several European countries using subsidies to help businesses and residents meet soaring energy costs triggered by Russia´s war in Ukraine. The amount the Greek government plans for September offsets is up from 1.1 billion euros in August. ""We are going to have a winter full of challenges and difficulties regarding supply adequacy and energy prices,"" Kostas Skrekas said in a televised statement announcing the September subsidy. Citing spiraling power prices triggered by the Ukraine war, Skrekas said the subsidy would apply to roughly 6 million households, regardless of income level or whether the energy supplied is for a main residence or secondary home. The subsidy will absorb 94% of power bill hikes for households, 89% of the price increase for small and medium-sized businesses, and 90% of the increase for farmers, he said. ""We are going through a period of international crisis which has sent energy prices soaring across Europe to unprecedented levels, threatening the social cohesion of European countries and of our country,"" Skrekas said, adding that the government was committed to providing a safety net for consumers to cope with ""these extraordinary circumstances.""

On Saturday, the country´s economy formally stopped being under ""enhanced surveillance"" by its European creditors, one of the vestiges of its financial crisis.

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-11137965/Euro-falls-parity-dollar-Whats-impact.html,2022-08-23,Euro falls below parity with the dollar. What's the impact?,"The euro has fallen below parity with the dollar, diving to its lowest level in 20 years and ending a one-to-one exchange rate with the U.S. currency. It's a psychological barrier in the markets. But psychology is important, and the euro's slide underlines the foreboding in the 19 European countries using the currency as they struggle with an energy crisis caused by Russia's war in Ukraine. Here's why the euro's slide is happening and what impact it could have: WHAT DOES EURO AND DOLLAR PARITY MEAN? It means the European and American currencies are worth the same amount. While constantly changing, the euro has dropped just below a value of $1 this week. A currency's exchange rate can be a verdict on economic prospects, and Europe's have been fading. Expectations that the economy would see a rebound after turning the corner from the COVID-19 pandemic have been replaced by recession predictions. FILE - The Euro sculpture stands in front of the former European Central Bank in Frankfurt, Germany, on July 13, 2022. The euro has fallen below parity with the dollar, diving to its lowest level in 20 years and ending a one-to-one exchange rate with the U.S. currency. .(AP Photo/Michael Probst) More than anything, high energy prices and record inflation are to blame. Europe is far more dependent on Russian oil and natural gas than the U.S. to keep industry humming and generate electricity. Fears that the war in Ukraine will lead to a loss of Russian oil on global markets have pushed oil prices higher. And Russia has been cutting back natural gas supplies to the European Union, which EU leaders described as retaliation for sanctions and weapons deliveries to Ukraine. Energy prices have driven euro-area inflation to a record 8.9% in July, making everything from groceries to utility bills more expensive. They also have raised fears about governments needing to ration natural gas to industries like steel, glassmaking and agriculture if Russia further reduces or shuts off the gas taps completely. The sense of doom increased as Russia reduced the flows through the Nord Stream 1 pipeline to Germany to 20% of capacity and said it would shut it down for three days next week for ""routine maintenance"" at a compressor station. Natural gas prices on Europe´s TTF benchmark have soared to record highs amid dwindling supplies, fears of further cutoffs and strong demand. ""If you think Euro at parity is cheap, think again,"" Robin Brooks, chief economist at the Institute of International Finance banking trade group, tweeted Monday. ""German manufacturing lost access to cheap Russian energy & thus its competitive edge."" ""Global recession is coming,"" he said in a second tweet. WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME THE EURO WAS EQUAL TO THE DOLLAR? The euro was last valued below $1 on July 15, 2002. The European currency hit its all-time high of $1.18 shortly after its launch on Jan. 1, 1999, but then began a long slide, falling through the $1 mark in February 2000 and hitting a record low of 82.30 cents in October 2000. It rose above parity in 2002 as large trade deficits and accounting scandals on Wall Street weighed on the dollar. Then as now, what appears to be a euro story is also in many ways a dollar story. That´s because the U.S. dollar is still the world´s dominant currency for trade and central bank reserves. And the dollar has been hitting 20-year highs against the currencies of its major trading partners, not just the euro. The dollar is also benefiting from its status as a safe haven for investors in times of uncertainty. WHY IS THE EURO FALLING? Many analysts attribute the euro's slide to expectations for rapid interest rate increases by the U.S. Federal Reserve to combat inflation at close to 40-year highs. As the Fed raises interest rates, the rates on interest-bearing investments tend to rise as well. If the Fed raises rates more than the European Central Bank, higher interest returns will attract investor money from euros into dollar-denominated investments. Those investors will have to sell euros and buy dollars to buy those holdings. That drives the euro down and the dollar up. Last month, the ECB raised interest rates for the first time in 11 years by a larger-than-expected half-percentage point. It is expected to add another increase in September. But if the economy sinks into recession, that could halt the ECB's series of rate increases. Meanwhile, the U.S. economy looks more robust, meaning the Fed could go on tightening - and widen the rate gap. WHO WINS? American tourists in Europe will find cheaper hotel and restaurant bills and admission tickets. The weaker euro could make European export goods more competitive on price in the United States. The U.S. and the EU are major trade partners, so the exchange rate shift will get noticed. In the U.S., a stronger dollar means lower prices on imported goods - from cars and computers to toys and medical equipment - which could help moderate inflation. WHO LOSES? American companies that do a lot of business in Europe will see the revenue from those businesses shrink when and if they bring those earnings back to the U.S. If euro earnings remain in Europe to cover costs there, the exchange rate becomes less of an issue. A key worry for the U.S. is that a stronger dollar makes U.S.-made products more expensive in overseas markets, widening the trade deficit and reducing economic output, while giving foreign products a price edge in the United States. A weaker euro can be a headache for the European Central Bank because it can mean higher prices for imported goods, particularly oil, which is priced in dollars. The ECB is already being pulled in different directions: It is raising interest rates, the typical medicine for inflation, but higher rates also can slow economic growth.

Gabrielius Landsbergis said Tuesday he prefers ""a European solution because it´s the most sustainable and legally correct."" ""If such a solution is not found, we do not rule out looking for a regional solution,"" Landsbergis said. He didn't elaborate on what that might be. The five countries he spoke about, which all are EU members, want the bloc as a whole to stop issuing tourist visas to Russian citizens. They have already either stopped issuing such visas or put limitations on them, saying Russians should not be able to take vacations in Europe while Moscow wages war in Ukraine. In Warsaw, Radoslaw Fogiel, a spokesman for Poland´s ruling conservative Law and Justice party, said Tuesday they want the ""toughest possible limitations in granting visas to Russians, on a European level."" However, there is no unanimity within the 27-member bloc and some EU leaders, including German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, have dismissed the idea as counterproductive. The EU itself has said that a full tourist ban doesn´t respect the rules and that each case should be examined individually. The visa issue will be raised at an informal meeting of European Union foreign ministers on Aug. 31. The EU banned air travel from Russia after Moscow launched its invasion of Ukraine. But Russians can still travel by land to neighboring EU countries and apparently are then taking flights to other European destinations. Visas issued in Europe´s travel zone, known as the Schengen area, can be used in the zone´s 26 countries - including 22 EU nations plus Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland. Normally, people and goods move freely between these countries without border checks. Lithuania, along with the other Baltic countries Latvia and Estonia, have taken a hard-line stance against Russia´s invasion of Ukraine. ___ Full coverage of the war in Ukraine: https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine"

He said government offices and banks will cut their work days to seven hours from the previous eight hours, but that private offices will be allowed to set their own schedules. Supply disruptions caused by the Ukraine war have led to soaring world prices for energy and food. Bangladesh has been taking measures in recent weeks to ease pressure on its declining foreign currency reserves. Last month, fuel prices were raised by more than 50%. The government says it is exploring options to get cheaper fuel from Russia under a special arrangement. The decision has drawn criticism, but the government said it is necessary to cut losses amid rising international fuel prices. Small street protests against the higher prices have taken place in recent weeks, and the government said domestic prices will be adjusted after international prices ease.

But authorities have promised to continue supplying power to industrial zones to help support the country´s $416 billion economy, which has been growing rapidly over the last decade. The country´s opposition has accused the government of failing to control corruption and eliminate losses in the energy sector. In July, Bangladesh sought an unspecified loan from the International Monetary Fund, becoming the third country in South Asia to do so recently after Sri Lanka and Pakistan. Rahul Anand, division chief in the IMF´s Asia and Pacific Department, said in a recent consultation that Bangladesh was not in a crisis situation and its external position was ""very different from several countries in the region."" ""Bangladesh has a low risk of debt distress and is very different from Sri Lanka,"" he was quoted as saying by the Dhaka-based The Business Standard Daily. Bangladesh´s foreign currency reserves have dwindled to around $40 billion."

Gas storage in Europe's biggest economy has reached 80.14% of capacity, according to industry figures released Tuesday. The head of Germany's network regulator, Klaus Mueller, tweeted that storage is ""being filled steadily"" but cautioned that a planned three-day halt to deliveries through the Nord Stream 1 pipeline from Russia next week ""could temporarily dampen"" the effort. Natural gas is used to power industry, heat homes and offices, and generate electricity. Increasing the amount in reserve has been a key focus of the German government since Russia invaded Ukraine to avoid rationing for industry as demand rises in the winter. The country's storage was about 56% full when Russian state-owned energy company Gazprom started cutting supplies through Nord Stream 1 in mid-June. It cited technical problems that German authorities have dismissed as cover for a political power play. In recent weeks, Nord Stream 1 has been running at only 20% of capacity. Gazprom announced Friday that the pipeline will shut from Aug. 31 to Sept. 2 for what it said is ""routine maintenance"" at a compressor station. Germany is one of several European countries to be hit by reductions in Russian natural gas supplies since the war started.

The joint managing director of gas industry coordination group Trading Hub Europe, Torsten Frank, cautioned in comments to the daily Rheinische Post that ""we will be able to fill many facilities to 95% by November, but not all."" However, he said that he doesn't expect a nationwide gas shortage to arise, though he can't rule out regional shortages. He said he is ""very confident that private households won't have to freeze this winter."" Russia accounted for a bit more than a third of Germany's gas supplies before the supply reductions started. In addition to prioritizing storage, authorities also are trying to encourage energy saving."

Slutsky, who took part in several rounds of talks with Ukrainian negotiators in March, indicated the killing would have repercussions for the conflict in Ukraine. ""We see that Kyiv isn´t inclined to have talks, and my own position as a member of the negotiation team is that it would be hard to engage in talks after that horrible tragedy,"" he said. Putin on Monday sent a letter of condolences to Dugin and his wife, denouncing the ""cruel and treacherous"" killing and saying that Dugina ""honestly served people and the Fatherland, proving what it means to be a patriot of Russia with her deeds."" He posthumously awarded Dugina the Order of Courage, one of Russia´s highest medals. Russia´s Federal Security Service, or FSB, the main successor to the KGB, said Dugina´s killing was ""prepared and perpetrated by the Ukrainian special services."" The FSB said that a Ukrainian citizen, Natalya Vovk, carried out the killing after arriving in Russia in July with her 12-year-old daughter and renting an apartment in the building where Dugina lived in order to shadow her. It said that Vovk and her daughter were at the nationalist festival that Dugin and his daughter attended. The agency said that Vovk drove to Estonia after the killing, using a different license plate for her vehicle. On Monday, the FSB released videos from surveillance cameras purportedly showing her entering and leaving Russia, and also a close-up of her allegedly in front of the entrance to a Moscow apartment building where Dugina lived and where Vovk rented an apartment. The FSB also posted pictures of her vehicle with different license plates. Estonian Foreign Minister Urmas Reinsalu dismissed the Russian claim, saying in televised remarks: ""We regard this as one instance of provocation in a very long line of provocations by the Russian Federation, and we have nothing more to say about it."" Dugin, dubbed ""Putin´s brain"" and ""Putin´s Rasputin"" by some in the West, has been a prominent proponent of the ""Russian world"" concept, a spiritual and political ideology that emphasizes traditional values, the restoration of Russia´s global influence and the unity of all ethnic Russians throughout the world. Dugin helped popularize the ""Novorossiya,"" or ""New Russia"" concept that Russia used to justify the 2014 annexation of Ukraine´s Crimean Peninsula and its support of separatist rebels in eastern Ukraine. He has urged the Kremlin to step up its operations in Ukraine. Dugin has also promoted authoritarian leadership in Russia and spoken with disdain of liberal Western values. He has been slapped with U.S. and European Union sanctions. His daughter expressed similar views and had appeared as a commentator on the TV channel Tsargrad, where Dugin had served as chief editor. Dugina herself was sanctioned by the U.S. in March for her work as chief editor of United World International, a website that Washington has described as a source of disinformation. ___ Jan M.

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-11137343/AP-PHOTOS-6-months-war-told-shutter-clicks.html,2022-08-23,AP PHOTOS: Documenting Russia's invasion of Ukraine,"During six months of war in Ukraine, Associated Press photographers have captured images that are both succinct and eloquent. The click of a shutter is brief, but the stories they tell are deep. Sometimes they show a life that ended in a moment - the body of a Russian soldier lying face down in the snow near a ruined tank. Others record a life ending, in agony and terror - medics carrying a mortally wounded pregnant woman on a stretcher through the ruins of a bomb-ravaged hospital in Mariupol. There are moments of bold energy, such as a rifle-carrying woman waving a Ukrainian flag in the intensely blue sky as a Kyiv monastery's tower rises in the background. Some portray lives that are just about to change, heading into the unknown. A father stands outside a railroad car in Kyiv, his hands pressed against the window framing the face of his young daughter as the train prepares to depart the besieged city for far-away but peaceful Lviv. Hundreds of people crowd under a destroyed bridge in the Kyiv suburb of Irpin, wondering if gunfire will abate long enough to even give them a chance to escape into the unknown. A woman walks her dog in Kyiv, an event from daily life. Her attentive gaze at her pet turns her face away from the ruins of a rocket-destroyed shopping center just behind her. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy sits on a staircase in his office, seemingly casually, his legs crossed and his chin resting in a hand. By his posture, he could be a man waiting for a romantic interest who's late. But the piles of sandbags behind him tell of the war's constancy. He is waiting, but not for a date - instead, to see how and when the war will end.

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-11137299/On-eve-Ukraines-national-day-fears-Russia-pounce.html,2022-08-23,Ukraine fears stepped-up attacks around national holiday,"The sense of dread deepened Tuesday in Ukraine because of warnings that Russia may try to spoil the country's Independence Day holiday and mark the war's six-month point with intensified attacks. The U.S. reinforced the worry with a security alert citing ""information that Russia is stepping up efforts to launch strikes against Ukraine´s civilian infrastructure and government facilities in the coming days."" As it has done previously, it urged American citizens to ""depart Ukraine now."" Several European countries issued similar warnings. Kyiv authorities banned mass gatherings in the capital through Thursday for fear of missile attacks around Independence Day, which, like the six-month mark in the war, falls on Wednesday. The holiday celebrates Ukraine's independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. ""Our country is having a very hard time, and we need to be careful,"" 26-year-old Vlad Mudrak said in support of the ban. Anxiety also mounted after the weekend car bombing outside Moscow that killed the daughter of a leading right-wing Russian political theorist. Russia accused Ukraine of carrying out the attack. While Ukraine denied involvement, the bloodshed stirred fears of Russian retaliation. Hundreds of people paid tribute at a memorial service Tuesday to the bombing victim, Darya Dugina, 29, the daughter of Alexander Dugin, a writer dubbed ""Putin's brain"" and ""Putin's Rasputin"" because of his purported influence on Russian President Vladimir Putin. In this photo provided by the Ukrainian Presidential Press Office, honour guard soldiers prepare to rise the Ukrainian national flag during State Flag Day celebrations in Kyiv, Ukraine, Tuesday, Aug. 23, 2022. (Ukrainian Presidential Press Office via AP) Dugina, a pro-Kremlin TV commentator, died when the SUV she was driving blew up Saturday night as she was returning home from a patriotic festival. Her father, a strong supporter of the invasion of Ukraine, was widely believed to be the intended target. Over the weekend, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy warned that Russia ""may try to do something particularly nasty, something particularly cruel"" this week. On Tuesday, however, Zelenskyy stressed defiance rather than worry when he raised the national flag at a memorial one day ahead of Independence Day. ""The blue and yellow flag of Ukraine will again fly where it rightfully should be - in all temporarily occupied cities and villages of Ukraine,"" he said, including the Crimea Peninsula, which Russia annexed in 2014. He added: ""It is necessary to liberate Crimea from occupation. It will end where it had started."" At a separate event, Zelenskyy appeared to downplay the threats this week, indicating that at most, he expected increased intensity rather than new targets, and he added, ""No one wants to die, but no one is afraid of Russia, and this is the most important signal."" NATO, meanwhile, said Zelenskyy can continue to count on the 30-nation alliance for help in defending itself in what Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg called ""a grinding war of attrition."" The war broke out on Feb. 24. ""This is a battle of wills and a battle of logistics. Therefore, we must sustain our support for Ukraine for the long term so that Ukraine prevails as a sovereign, independent nation,"" Stoltenberg said at an international conference on Crimea. One particular source of foreboding is Europe´s largest nuclear power plant, in southeastern Ukraine, where shelling has raised fears of a catastrophe. Shelling close to the Zaporizhzhia plant continued early Tuesday. Regional Gov. Valentyn Reznichenko said Russian forces fired on Marhanets and Nikopol, two towns less than a dozen kilometers (7 miles) from the power station. The U.N. Security Council met Tuesday to discuss the danger, and the U.N. nuclear agency renewed its request to assess safety and security at the plant if Ukraine and Russia agree. Another source of concern is the fate of Ukrainian prisoners of war. Michelle Bachelet, U.N. high commissioner for human rights, cited reports that Russia and its separatist allies in eastern Ukraine are planning to put Ukrainian POWs on trial, possibly in the coming days. The Kremlin has denounced Ukrainian prisoners as Nazis, war criminals and terrorists, and several prisoners have been sentenced to death. In the eastern Ukrainian city of Donetsk, Russian authorities reported four people were killed and nearly a dozen wounded in Ukrainian shelling of a separatist headquarters and other buildings. In other developments, the U.S. plans to announce on Wednesday an additional $3 billion or so in aid to train and equip Ukrainian forces, according to American officials speaking on condition of anonymity. They said the money will fund contracts for drones and other weapons. A small bright spot emerged in Ukraine: A new soccer season started Tuesday in Kyiv. Shakhtar Donetsk and Metalist 1925 from Kharkiv - teams from eastern cities fighting for their existence - played to a 0-0 draw in a 65,000-capacity downtown stadium with no fans allowed. ""This is work ... to show the world that life in Ukraine does not stop but continues,"" Shakhtar coach Igor Jovicevic said. ___ Full coverage of the war in Ukraine: https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine In this photo provided by the Ukrainian Presidential Press Office, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy stands in front of lined up soldiers as he arrives for State Flag Day celebrations in Kyiv, Ukraine, Tuesday, Aug. 23, 2022.

Twenty-two weeks after she was wounded, she´s still waiting to have her foot amputated and to be fitted with a prosthetic. She keeps the piece of shrapnel surgeons removed during one of her many operations.

(AP Photo/Evgeniy Maloletka, File) Danyk lives with his mother and grandmother in a house near Chernihiv, a town 140 kilometers (nearly 90 miles) north of Kyiv, where a piece of tarp covers the broken bedroom windows. He sells milk from the family's cow that grazes in the nearby fields. A handwritten sign wrapped in clear plastic on the front gate reads: ""Please buy milk to help my mother who is injured."" ""My mother needs surgery and that´s why I have to help her. I have to help my grandmother too because she has heart problems,"" Danyk said. Before schools reopen on Sept. 1, Danyk and his grandmother have been joining volunteers several days a week clearing the debris from buildings damaged and destroyed in the Russian bombardment outside Chernihiv. On the way, he stops at his old house, most of it smashed to the foundations. ""This was my bedroom,"" he says, standing next to scorched mattress springs that protrude from the rubble of bricks and plaster. Polite and soft spoken, Danyk says his father and stepfather are both fighting in the Ukrainian army. ""My father is a soldier, my uncles are soldiers and my grandfather was a soldier, too. My stepfather is a soldier and I will be a soldier,"" he says with a look of determination. ""I want to be an air force pilot."" ""THIS BRIDGE WAS THE ROAD FROM HELL"" Before the Russian withdrawal from Kyiv and surrounding areas on April 2, suburbs and towns near the city´s airport were pounded by rockets, artillery fire and aerial bombardment in an effort to break the Ukrainian defenses. Entire city blocks of apartments were blackened by the shelling in Irpin, just 20 kilometers (12 miles) northwest of the capital, along a route where police Lt. Ruslan Huseinov patrolled daily. Some of the most dramatic scenes from the early stages of the war were of the evacuation from Irpin underneath a destroyed highway bridge, where thousands escaped the relentless attacks. Huseinov was there for 16 days, organizing crossings where the elderly were carried along muddy pathways in wheelbarrows. Reconstruction work has begun on the bridge, where mangled concrete and iron bars hang over the river. Clothing and shoes from those who fled can still be seen tangled in the debris. ""This bridge was the road from hell,"" says Huseinov, 34, standing next to an overturned white van still lodged into a slab of smashed concrete. ""We got people out of (Irpin) because conditions were terrible - with bombing and shelling,"" he said. ""People were really scared because many lost their children, members of their family, their brothers and sisters."" Crosses made from construction wood are still nailed to the railings of the bridge to honor those lost and the effort to save civilians. ""The whole world witnessed our solidarity,"" says Huseinov, who grew up in Germany and says he would never again take the good things in life for granted. ""In my mind, everything has changed: My values in life,"" he said. ""Now I understand what we have to lose."" ""BEFORE THE WAR, IT WAS ANOTHER LIFE"" The floor of the Church of Andrew the Apostle has been re-tiled and bullet holes in the walls plastered over and repainted - but the horror of what happened in March lies only a few yards away. The largest mass grave in Bucha - a town outside Kyiv that has become synonymous with the brutality of the Russian attack - is behind the church. ""This grave contained 116 people, including 30 women, and two children,"" said Father Andriy, who has conducted multiple burial services for civilians found shot dead or killed by shelling, some still only identified as a number while the effort to name all of Bucha´s victims continues. Many of the bodies were found before the Russians pulled out of the Kyiv region, Father Andriy said. ""We couldn´t bury people in the cemetery because it´s on the outskirts of the city. They left people, dead people, lying in the street. Dead people were found still in their cars. They were trying to leave but the Russians shelled them,"" said Father Andriy, wearing a large cross around his neck and a dark purple cassock. ""That situation lasted two weeks, and the local authorities began coming up with solutions (to help) relatives and loved ones. It was bad weather and wild animals were discovering the bodies. So something had to be done."" He decided to carry out burial services in the church yard, many next to where the bodies had been discovered. The experience , he said, has left people in the town badly shaken. ""I think that, neither myself or anyone who lives in Ukraine, who witnessed the war, can understand why this happened,"" he said. ""Before the war, it was another life."" ""For now we are surviving on adrenaline,"" he said. ""But I´m worried that the aftermath will last decades. It will be hard to get past this and turn the page. Saying the word `forgive´ isn´t difficult. But to say it from your heart - for now , that´s not possible."" ___ Full coverage of the war in Ukraine: https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine ___ AP staffers Vasilisa Stepanenko and Roman Hrytsyna contributed.

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-11136949/Moscow-seeks-sense-normal-amid-Ukraine-conflict.html,2022-08-23,Moscow seeks a 'sense of normal' amid Ukraine conflict,"At Moscow's sprawling Izmailovsky outdoor souvenir market, shoppers can find cups and T-shirts commemorating Russia's deployment of troops into Ukraine - but from the 2014 annexation of the Crimean Peninsula. There's nothing about the ""special military operation"" that began six months ago. Throughout the capital, there are few overt sign that Russia is engaged in the worst fighting in Europe since World War II. Displays of the letter ""Z"" - which initially spread as an icon of the fight, replicating the insignia painted on Russian military vehicles - are hardly seen. There are only some scattered posters on bus shelters, showing the impassive face of one soldier or another and the words, ""Glory to the heroes of Russia."" The posters give no clue as to what the man did, or where he did it. The public reticence, or denial, about the operation in Ukraine is striking in a country where military exploits are deeply woven into the social fabric. The annexation of Crimea produced almost instant memes, notably images of President Vladimir Putin that called him ""the most polite person."" a smug variant on the characterization of Russian troops as polite. Victory Day, marking the defeat of Nazi Germany, is obsessively observed with weeks of anticipation. A Lamborghini dealership on Kutuzovsky Prospekt, a main Moscow thoroughfare, still displays a Victory Day banner, even though the showroom is dark. Lamborghini pulled out of Russia, along with hundreds of other foreign companies that suspended or ended their operations after Russia sent troops into Ukraine. Darkened storefronts and deserted spaces in shopping malls that once held popular fast-food outlets such as McDonald's and Starbucks are the most visible sign of the conflict in Moscow. The companies' departures were a psychological blow to Muscovites who had become used to the shiny comforts of consumer culture. People walk at the Izmailovsky Kremlin in Moscow, Russia, Sunday, Aug. 21, 2022. Six months after Russia sent troops into Ukraine, there's little sign of the conflict on Moscow's streets and the capital's residents seem unconcerned about the economic and political sanctions by Western countries. (AP Photo) ""At first, we were very disappointed,"" said Yegor Driganov, a young man taking in the view along the riverbank opposite Moscow City, a cluster of gleaming towers that includes four of Europe's five tallest buildings. ""But stores started to appear to replace them."" Former McDonald's and Starbucks outlets were acquired by Russian entrepreneurs who speedily moved to reopen with almost carbon-copy operations. ""We walk around, go around as usual,"" said Driganov's companion, Polina Polishchuk, characterizing the city's mood. Although the belief that Russia can create homegrown alternatives to businesses that left has become an article of faith among officials, many Russians have private doubts. A survey by the Levada Center, Russia's only independent pollster, found that 81% of Russians believe the country will be able to replace foreign food operations with domestic alternatives, while only 41% think local industries can fully substitute for electronic goods and only a third believe domestic car production can make up for the loss of imports. The automotive industry was slammed by sanctions that dried up the supply of parts. The state statistics service said car production in May had fallen a punishing 97% from the same month in 2021. Putin recently admitted Russia's shipyards are also suffering supply shortages. The panic that swept Russia in the immediate aftermath of broad Western sanctions and foreign companies abandoned the country has abated. The ruble, which lost half of its value against the dollar right after the sanctions, not only rebounded but rose to levels not seen in years. But if that's good for national pride, it's a burden on export-reliant industries whose products became more costly. Russia's economic prospects are far from clear amid crosscutting statistics. Unemployment is down, contrary to many predictions. But the gross domestic product fell a sharp 4% in the second quarter of the year - the first full period of fighting - and is predicted to contract by nearly 8% for the full year. Inflation is calculated to be 15% for the year. ""It seems to me that it´s obvious to everyone that it won´t be as it was before,"" Central Bank of Russia head Elvira Nabiullina warned the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum, an annual showpiece gathering aimed at investors. ""External conditions have changed for a long time indeed, if not forever."" But if impending economic troubles are obvious, they don't appear to be causing wide anxiety. Izmailovsky souvenir vendor Mikhail Sukhorukov shrugged off concerns, even though European sanctions on air travel to Russia have cut off much of the tourist trade that was important to him. ""It's periodical, like a wave,"" he said, adding that he chose to be sanguine rather than ""go to the cemetery."" ""Moscow leads its normal life because people are trying to preserve their sense of normal and relative psychological comfort,"" said Nikolai Petrov, a senior research fellow at Chatham House's Russia and Eurasia Program. ""Russia is at full steam heading toward a dead end and the people, by and large, prefer not to think about it and live their lives."" Petrov also suggested that Muscovites are amid a ""summer effect ... when a person not so much watches what is happening in the world, even in a neighboring country, but rather builds his own reality with family, vacationing and so on."" The desire to take vacations has been a peculiar success story for Russia's sense of self-sufficiency in the sanctions era. Denied easy air connections to Western Europe - industry experts say Russian travel to popular Italy has dropped to nearly nothing - Russians have found exotic domestic destinations, such as Sakhalin Island, 6,300 kilometers (3,900 miles) from Moscow, where tourism reportedly is up 25%; traffic to Baltic Sea beaches in Kaliningrad has reached all time daily highs. Tourism to Crimea, however, is expected to be about 40% lower than usual. Although Moscow's streets show little indication that a conflict is raging, the airwaves of full of the news. The flagship news magazine show on state TV, Vesti Nedeli, recently devoted nearly an hour - about half its running time - to the Ukraine operation. Lengthy segments painted the Kremlin's military as highly effective, using top-of-the-line weapons. About 60% of Russians rely on state television as their main news source, but may find it unreliable. A Levada survey this month found that fully 65% of Russians disbelieve some or all of what they see on state media about Ukraine. ""There are a lot of (media) sources"" to counter state TV, said Driganov, relaxing along the river. Many of those sources, however, can be accessed only through a VPN, or virtual private network. Russia has banned or blocked an array of foreign news media, bullied critical domestic media into closing and banned use of Facebook and Twitter. In a repressive environment, assessing the population's views as a whole, even by an internationally respected pollster such as Levada, is uncertain. Levada polling polling found about 75% of Russians support the military operation, but less than half do so unconditionally. Some of the equivocators probably expressed support ""just in case, fearing repercussions for themselves."" said Levada director Denis Volkov. ___ Associated Press writer Dasha Litvinova in Tallinn, Estonia, contributed.

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-11136403/US-Russia-looks-step-hits-Ukraine-infrastructure.html,2022-08-23,US: Russia looks to step up hits on Ukraine infrastructure,"The U.S. State Department on Monday issued a security alert warning that Russia is stepping up efforts to launch strikes against Ukraine´s civilian infrastructure and government facilities in the coming days. The U.S. Embassy in Kyiv urged U.S. citizens still in Ukraine to depart the country immediately. ""If you hear a loud explosion or if sirens are activated, immediately seek cover,"" the State Department said in its alert. ""If in a home or a building, go to the lowest level of the structure with the fewest exterior walls, windows, and openings; close any doors and sit near an interior wall, away from any windows or openings."" The State Department issued the alert after the U.S. intelligence community on Monday declassified a finding that determined that Russia would increasingly target Ukrainian civilian infrastructure, according to a U.S. official familiar with the intelligence. The official was not authorized to comment publicly about the finding and spoke on the condition of anonymity. The new intelligence comes as Russia's brutal invasion of Ukraine will hit the six-month mark Wednesday, which coincides with Ukraine's independence day from Soviet Union rule. President Joe Biden spoke Sunday with British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz about concerns about shelling near the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in southeastern Ukraine and called for the United Nations nuclear watchdog to visit the power plant.

(AP Photo/Evgeniy Maloletka) The official said, however, that the intelligence finding is not specifically tied to concerns about Zaporizhzhia. The Biden administration is battling to keep western allies - and Washington - focused on maintaining pressure on Russian President Vladimir Putin. Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell said Monday the ""single most important thing going on in the world right now is to beat the Russians in Ukraine."" Speaking at a luncheon event in Scott County, Kentucky, McConnell said the one fear he has is that the U.S. and others will ""all kind of lose interest"" as the war drags on. ""We need to stick with them,"" McConnell said. ""It´s important to us, and to the rest of the world, that they succeed."" - AP Congressional Correspondent Lisa Mascaro contributed reporting.

The U.N. chief told the U.N. Security Council that the commitment to dialogue and reason that led to the recent deal restarting grain and fertilizer shipments from Ukraine and Russia must be applied to ""the critical situation"" at Europe´s largest nuclear power plant at Zaporizhzhia in southeastern Ukraine, where continued shelling and fighting in the area has raised fears of a nuclear catastrophe. Saying ""humanity´s future is in our hands today,"" Guterres urged all countries ""to recommit to a world free of nuclear weapons and to spare no effort to come to the negotiating table to ease tensions and end the nuclear arms race, once and for all."" The secretary-general spoke at a council meeting organized by China, which holds the presidency this month, on ""promoting common security through dialogue and cooperation."" Across the world, Guterres said, collective security is being tested as ""never before,"" pointing to geopolitical divides, conflicts, military coups, invasions, lengthy wars and differences between the world´s great powers, ""including at this council."" He also cited ""challenges that were unimaginable to our predecessors -- cyberwarfare, terrorism, and lethal autonomous weapons."" United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres, speaks to the media during a press conference at the Joint Coordination Center in Istanbul, Turkey, Saturday, Aug. 20, 2022. United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres on Saturday praised the ""remarkable and inspiring operation"" that has seen some 650,000 metric tons of grain and other food shipped from Ukraine. (AP Photo/Khalil Hamra) ""And the nuclear risk has climbed to its highest point in decades,"" Guterres warned. The council meeting took place during the pandemic-delayed conference to review the 50-year-old Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, which is considered the cornerstone of international disarmament efforts. It is taking place against the backdrop of Russian President Vladimir Putin´s warning after his Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine that Russia is a ""potent"" nuclear power and any attempt to interfere would lead to ""consequences you have never seen,"" and his decision to put Russia´s nuclear forces on high alert. Putin has since said that ""a nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought,"" a message reiterated by a senior Russian official on the opening day of the NPT conference on Aug. 2. The NPT sought to prevent the spread of nuclear arms beyond the five original nuclear powers -- the U.S., Russia, Chuna Britain and France -- and eventually achieve a nuclear-free world. It requires non-nuclear signatory nations not to pursue atomic weapons in exchange for a commitment by the five powers to move toward nuclear disarmament and to guarantee non-nuclear states´ access to peaceful nuclear technology for producing energy. Gustavo Zlauvinen, president of the NPT review conference, told the Security Council without naming any country that since February ""the NPT faces a raft of challenges, the diversity and scope of which are unlike anything that has come before."" It should be no surprise, he said, that concerns have grown on the need for urgent action on disarmament. Zlauvinen, an Argentinian Foreign Ministry official, called ""the norm"" against using nuclear weapons one of the most important achievements of the post-World War II era, but warned that ""it is increasingly threatened."" He also warned that the current global security environment revived the belief that nuclear weapons provide ""the ultimate security guarantee,"" calling this ""an extremely damaging narrative and dangerous for nonproliferation."" Russia´s U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia told the council ""the international security system is experiencing a profound crisis"" and trust between key international players at nearly all the institutions it is based on is at ""a critically low level."" For over 200 years, he said, Western countries have blamed Russia for everything. Nebenzia accused the United States and its allies of ""acting in the same reckless and provocative manner in Asia and Africa"" as they are in Ukraine. And he said, ""the reckless American scheme involving Taiwan is proceeding in the same vein."" He said Russia called for an emergency meeting of the Security Council Tuesday on what he called Ukrainian provocations at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant. He accused ""Western countries supporting Ukraine of ""essentially helping Kyiv in its attempts of nuclear blackmail"" while ignoring shelling of the facility by Ukrainian armed force. Ukraine has accused Russia of using the plant as a military base and shelling it and the surroundings. U.S. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield told the council that one of the greatest threats to maintaining global peace and security is Russia´s full-scale invasion of its neighbor and fellow member of the United Nations. She listed diplomatic efforts by the U.S. and many other nations to prevent Moscow´s military action. ""Russia, however, rejected dialogue, discarded established views of sovereign equality, discarded the concept of indivisibility of security, and launched a horrific war,"" she said. Thomas-Greenfield took after Russia´s repeated saying that the security of one state cannot come at the expense of another, saying ""Russia´s tortured, full-throated messaging on the supposed threats it faces from its neighbors omits the fact that all nations have the right to choose their security alliances."""

The elegant Olympic Stadium has staged the biggest European soccer games in the past decade though none as poignant as the opening-day meeting of Shakhtar Donetsk and Metalist 1925 from Kharkiv - teams from eastern cities that are fighting for their very existence. No fans will be allowed in the 65,000-capacity downtown stadium for the 1 p.m. local time kickoff and the players must be rushed to bomb shelters if air-raid sirens sound. ""We have rules in case of an alarm and we should go to be underground,"" Shakhtar captain Taras Stepanenko said Monday in a telephone interview with The Associated Press. ""But I think the teams, the players will be proud of this event."" ""We are ready, we are strong and I think we will show to all the world Ukrainian life and will to win,"" the national-team veteran said. The Ukrainian Premier League returns with the blessing of the nation´s leaders and in a week heavy with meaning.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says he's committed to pressing for peace despite Russian attacks on civilians that have stunned the world. (AP Photo/Evgeniy Maloletka, File) Tuesday is Ukraine´s national flag day and Wednesday - Aug. 24 - is the celebration of independence from control by Moscow that the former Soviet Union republic declared in 1991. ""I spoke with our president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, about how important football is to distract,"" Ukraine soccer federation president Andriy Pavelko told the AP in June about the commitment to restart. ""We spoke about how it would be possible that football could help us to think about the future."" No competitive soccer has been played in Ukraine since mid-December when the league paused for a scheduled midwinter break. Games were due to resume on Feb. 25, until the Russian military invasion started one day earlier. The 16-team league restarts without Desna Chernihiv and Mariupol, teams from cities that have suffered brutal destruction. All games will be played in and around Kyiv and further west and will be shown domestically, abroad and on YouTube in a deal with broadcaster Setanta agreed last week. The total value of $16.2 million over three years is less than some elite English Premier League players will earn this season. The concept of home-field advantage may have gone for most teams though simply playing on Ukrainian soil - other games Tuesday are in Kyiv, Uzhhorod and Kovalivka - is remarkable. Ukrainian clubs fulfilling their games in UEFA's European competitions in recent weeks played in neighboring Poland and Slovakia, or Sweden, to ensure the safety of opponents like Benfica and Fenerbahçe. Shakhtar, which was top of the domestic standings when last season was formally abandoned, will host opponents at Legia Warsaw´s stadium when the Champions League group stage starts Sept. 6. The groups are drawn Thursday. Just 10 months ago, Stepanenko and Shakhtar faced eventual title winner Real Madrid in a Champions League game at the Olympic Stadium - the same field where the storied Spanish team won the final in 2018. Last season, Shakhtar could field the core of Brazilian players it became famous for, funded by billionaire businessman Rinat Akhmetov who also owns the Azovstal steelworks in Mariupol. Those star players have now left Ukraine and Shakhtar will rely more on young, homegrown talent, just like its traditional rival Dynamo Kyiv, which starts Sunday against Dnipro-1. ""Of course, it´s a new team,"" Stepanenko acknowledged, adding: ""We feel confident because we play for our country and for our people."" ___ More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports"

Shares of the of the oil producer soared nearly 12% Friday after the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission revealed that it had approved Berkshire's request to buy up to 50% of the Houston company. Shares slid 3% to around $69 amid a broader sell-off Monday and as speculation cooled over the potential for Berkshire to buy the entire company. Berkshire doesn't typically comment on its stock investments beyond what it is required to disclose, and Buffett didn't respond to questions about Occidental on Monday. But Buffett told shareholders at the company's annual meeting in April that he started buying Occidental shares in late February because what the CEO was telling investors then ""made nothing but sense"" to him. Berkshire's Occidental purchases and a $20 billion investment in Chevron shares early this year allowed Buffett to capitalize on the surge in oil prices after Russia invaded Ukraine. Edward Jones analyst Jim Shanahan said he thinks it´s likely that Berkshire will keep buying Occidental shares when the price drops below $60 again. The shares are up 13% in just the past 30 days, and up 130% this year. But he doesn´t think it´s likely that Berkshire will try to acquire the whole company unless Occidental shares fall significantly.

In addition to Berkshire's massive stake in Occidental's common shares, it also holds $10 billion worth of preferred stock and warrants to buy another 83.9 million Occidental shares at $59.62 apiece.

Scholz, who took over from Angela Merkel late last year, is in Canada this week and will sign a deal with Trudeau to supply clean hydrogen to Germany. ""Canada plays a really, really central role for the development of green hydrogen,"" Scholz said. ""That´s why we are very glad to be able to expand our cooperation in this area on this occasion too."" He said Germany would like to be a partner of Canada in the future export of green hydrogen, but in the meantime natural gas will be needed. Trudeau, however, played down the likelihood of direct gas exports to Germany due to logistical constraints and costs. Trudeau said it would need to make business sense. ""There are a number of potential projects that are in the books for which there has never been a strong business case,"" Trudeau said. ""It needs to make sense for Germany to important LNG from the east coast."" Scholz thanked Canada for allowing the export, despite sanctions on Moscow, of a refurbished turbine that Russia said it needed to continue providing natural gas to Europe through the Nord Stream 1 pipeline. The fact Russia has yet to request the needed turbine, which is currently in Germany, showed the Russian claims about technical issues hampering gas supplies to Russia were a ruse, he said. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz chat prior to a meeting in Montreal on Monday, Aug. 22, 2022. (Paul Chiasson/The Canadian Press via AP) ""Russia is no longer a reliable business partner,"" Scholz said. ""It has reduced gas deliveries everywhere in Europe, always referring to technical reasons that never existed. And that´s why it´s important not to walk into (Russian President Vladimir) Putin´s trap."" Russia's Gazprom reduced gas deliveries through the Nord Stream 1 pipeline to Germany by 60% in June. The state-owned gas company cited alleged technical problems involving the turbine that partner Siemens Energy sent to Canada for overhaul and couldn´t be returned because of sanctions imposed over Russia´s invasion of Ukraine. The pipeline will also shut down for three days of maintenance at the end of this month, Gazprom announced last week, raising economic pressure on Germany and other European countries that depend on the fuel to power industry, generate electricity and heat homes. Scholz said Russia is trying to split allies who support Ukraine and this should never succeed. Natural gas prices have surged as Russia has reduced or cut off natural gas flows to a dozen European Union countries, fueling inflation and raising the risk that Europe could plunge into recession. Germans have been urged to cut gas use now so the country will have enough for the winter ahead. Scholz said Germany is building a lot of ports and pipelines on the northern shores of Germany and many other places to allow for LNG imports. ""We are working hard to become independent of this gas supply and we are doing a lot of investments to make it happen and we are doing it as fast as every possible. Never has such an infrastructure been built in Germany in that a short time,"" Scholz said. ____ Associated Press writer Frank Jordans in Berlin contributed to this report.

In addition to the walled Croatian tourist resort of Dubrovnik, the aircraft flew over the government headquarters in Skopje, North Macedonia, the downtown Skanderbeg Square in the Albanian capital, Tirana, and up the Adriatic coast of Montenegro. The Balkans and the Adriatic Sea have lately seen increased military, intelligence and propaganda activity by Moscow, which considers the region of its strategic interest because of its access to the Mediterranean.

The two B-52 Stratofortress aircraft are assigned to the 23rd Bomb Squadron currently operating out of RAF Fairford, United Kingdom. Since 2018, the U.S. has conducted more than 200 Bomber Task Force sorties with allies and partners. Most recently, this involved B-1B Lancer flights over the Nordic, Baltic, and Black Sea regions in May, as well as an air policing overflight of North Macedonia in June. In June, Stratofortresses conducted flights over the Arctic Ocean, and later took part in BALTOPS, the largest annual exercise in the Baltic Sea. In the Baltic Sea, the amphibious warship USS Kearsarge -- the largest warship ever to visit Lithuania - was officially welcomed Monday.

Interior Minister Aleksandar Vulin, who is known for his pro-Russia and anti-Western stance, said he told Lavrov during their meeting that ""Serbia is the only state in Europe that didn´t introduce sanctions and was not part of the anti-Russian hysteria."" Serbia, which formally seeks European Union membership, has for years been drifting away from its EU path and toward traditional Slavic ally Russia, as well as China. Vulin is considered ""Moscow´s man"" within the Serbian government. Vulin has been advocating the creation of ""the Serbian World"" that would unite all Serbs in the Balkans under one flag led by Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic. Vulin has said that Serbia should abandon its EU membership goal and instead turn to Moscow, and he has often blasted Serbia´s neighbors and their leaders, calling them derogatory names. In this photo released by Russian Foreign Ministry Press Service, Serbia's Interior Minister Aleksandar Vulin, left, and Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov walk during their meeting in Moscow, Russia, Monday, Aug. 22, 2022. (Russian Foreign Ministry Press Service via AP) Last year, Vulin had created a ""working group"" with Nikolai Patrushev, the powerful secretary of the Kremlin´s Security Council, to fight ""color revolutions"" -- a series of mass protests that sometimes led to the toppling of regimes in the former Soviet Union, the former Yugoslavia, the Middle East and Asia. Serbian independent media reported that at their meeting in Moscow late last year, Vulin handed to Patrushev wiretaps from a Belgrade meeting held by members of the Russian opposition. It has been difficult for opposition groups to organize meetings in Russia, so they chose Belgrade as they don't need visas to enter Serbia. Shortly afterwards, some of those who attended the meeting in Belgrade were arrested in Russia. Vulin has unconvincingly denied that he handed over the tapes to Patrushev. Serbian opposition officials have been questioning the purpose of Vulin´s visit to Moscow as a new Serbian government is about to be formed - long-awaited after the April general election. Most believe that his trip to Russia was organized by Moscow as a way to pressure Belgrade to include him in the new Cabinet. Lavrov had planned to visit Belgrade in June, but Serbia´s NATO-member neighbors have refused to allow his plane to fly over their territory. Vulin said in a statement from Moscow on Monday that he ""deeply regrets the fact that Minister Lavrov was prevented from visiting Belgrade in June by the will of other countries, pointing out that by banning Minister Lavrov´s official visit to Serbia, all principles of international law were violated."""

The ministry said in a statement that the discovery by partners Eni of Italy and France´s Total was made at the Cronos-1 well 160 kilometers (100 miles) off the coast in 2,287 meters (7,500 feet) of water inside Cyprus' exclusive economic zone and is the second deposit that the Eni-Total consortium has discovered there. The consortium hasn´t provided any estimates regarding how much natural gas is contained in the initial ""Calypso"" field found in 2018. But Eni said in a statement Monday that the Cronos-1 discovery ""can unlock additional potential in the area"" and is part of the company´s ""successful effort to provide further gas supply to Europe."" The Cronos discovery brings the number of deposits found off Cyprus to four - two by Eni-Total, one by ExxonMobil and partners Qatar Petroleum estimated to hold 5-8 trillion cubic feet of gas and another by Chevron and partners Shell and Israeli NewMed Energy that contains up to 4.4 trillion cubic feet. The Energy Ministry said the Eni-Total consortium´s drill ship Tungsten Explorer has now relocated to a new well target to ""assess the quantities of gas with greater precision."" The Cypriot government has said that Russia´s invasion of Ukraine provided an additional impetus to the search for alternative fuel sources, especially after the European Union confirmed that natural gas could act as a bridge fuel until 2050 as part of the bloc´s transition to cleaner energy.

(AP Photo/Petros Karadjias, File) Energy Minister Natasa Pilides said the EU's drive to wean itself off Russian gas further entrenches Cyprus' inclusion into the 27-member bloc's energy planning. Pilides said the fact that the new discovery is in an area adjacent to where ExxonMobil is drilling could pave the way for cooperation with the Eni-Total consortium. She added that the most likely scenario for getting gas to European markets remains conveying it through a pipeline to Egyptian processing plants for liquefaction and then transporting it by ship.

Ukraine denied involvement. Darya Dugina, a 29-year-old commentator with a nationalist Russian TV channel, died when a remotely controlled explosive device planted in her SUV blew up on Saturday night as she was driving on the outskirts of Moscow, ripping the vehicle apart and killing her on the spot, authorities said. Her father, Alexander Dugin, a philosopher, writer and political theorist who ardently supports Russian President Vladimir Putin's decision to send troops into Ukraine, was widely believed to be the intended target. Russian media quoted witnesses as saying that the SUV belonged to Dugin and that he had decided at the last minute to travel in another vehicle. Russia´s Federal Security Service, or FSB, the main successor to the KGB, said Dugina's killing was ""prepared and perpetrated by the Ukrainian special services."" The FSB said a Ukrainian citizen, Natalya Vovk, carried out the killing and then fled to Estonia. In Estonia, the prosecutor general's office said in a statement carried by the Baltic News Services that it ""has not received any requests or inquiries from the Russian authorities on this topic."" In this handout photo taken from video released by Investigative Committee of Russia on Sunday, Aug. 21, 2022, investigators work on the site of explosion of a car driven by Daria Dugina outside Moscow. Daria Dugina, the daughter of Alexander Dugin, the Russian nationalist ideologist often called ""Putin's brain"", was killed when her car exploded on the outskirts of Moscow, officials said Sunday. The Investigate Committee branch for the Moscow region said the Saturday night blast was caused by a bomb planted in the SUV driven by Daria Dugina.(Investigative Committee of Russia via AP) The FSB said Vovk arrived in Russia in July with her 12-year-old daughter and rented an apartment in the building where Dugina lived in order to shadow her. It said that Vovk and her daughter were at a nationalist festival that Dugin and his daughter attended just before the killing. The agency released video of the suspect from surveillance cameras at the border crossings and at the entrance to the Moscow apartment building. The FSB said Vovk used a license plate for Ukraine's Russian-backed separatist Donetsk region to enter Russia and a Kazakhstan plate in Moscow before switching to a Ukrainian one to cross into Estonia. Ukraine´s presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak denied any Ukrainian involvement in the bombing. In a tweet, he dismissed the FSB claims as fiction, casting them as part of infighting between Russian security agencies. In a letter extending condolences to Dugin and his wife, Putin denounced the ""cruel and treacherous"" killing and added that Dugina ""honestly served people and the Fatherland, proving what it means to be a patriot of Russia with her deeds."" He posthumously awarded Dugina the Order of Courage, one of Russia's highest medals. Russian Foreign Minisry spokeswoman Maria Zakharov said Dugina´s killing reflected Kyiv´s reliance on ""terrorism as an instrument of its criminal ideology."" In a statement, Dugin described his daughter as a ""rising star"" who was ""treacherously killed by enemies of Russia."" ""Our hearts are longing not just for revenge and retaliation. It would be too petty, not in Russia style,"" Dugin wrote. ""We need only victory."" The car bombing, unusual for Moscow since the gang wars of the turbulent 1990s, triggered calls from Russian nationalists to respond by ramping up strikes on Ukraine. Sergei Markov, a pro-Kremlin political analyst, argued that the perpetrators of Dugina´s killing might have hoped to encourage a split between those in the Russian elite who advocate a political compromise to end the hostilities in Ukraine and proponents of even tougher military action. Dugin, dubbed ""Putin's brain"" and ""Putin's Rasputin"" by some in the West, has been a prominent proponent of the ""Russian world"" concept, a spiritual and political ideology that emphasizes traditional values, the restoration of Russia´s global influence and the unity of all ethnic Russians throughout the world. Dugin helped popularize the ""Novorossiya,"" or ""New Russia"" concept that Russia used to justify the 2014 annexation of Ukraine´s Crimean Peninsula and its support of separatist rebels in eastern Ukraine. He has urged the Kremlin to step up its operations in Ukraine. Dugin has also promoted authoritarian leadership in Russia and spoken with disdain of liberal Western values. He has been slapped with U.S. and European Union sanctions. His daughter expressed similar views and had appeared as a commentator on the TV channel Tsargrad, where Dugin had served as chief editor. Dugina herself was sanctioned by the U.S. in March for her work as chief editor of United World International, a website that Washington has described as a source of disinformation. In an appearance on Russian television last week, Dugina called America ""a zombie society"" where people oppose Russia but cannot find it on a map. U.S. State Department spokesman Ned Price said Monday that Washington ""unequivocally"" condemns the targeting of civilians. ""We condemn the targeting of civilians, whether that´s in Kiev, whether that´s in Bucha, whether that´s in Kharkiv, whether that´s in Kramatorsk, whether that´s in Mariupol, or whether that´s in Moscow. That principle applies around the world,"" Price said.

Police have erected a yellow fence to cordon off the area near the monument, which stands like a high-rise in downtown Riga's Victory Park. It has an 80-meter (260-foot) concrete spire with a Soviet star on top, with two groups of statues beside the edge of a pond. The monument, built in 1985 while Latvia was still part of the Soviet Union, will be felled using machinery on Tuesday, said Janis Lange, the Latvian capital's executive director. He told a news conference that it will be toppled without the use of explosives, according to Latvian television. It wasn't immediately clear what would happen to the monument after it's taken down. The concrete obelisk is part of a complex that includes two groups of statues - a band of three Red Army soldiers and on the other side a woman representing the ""Motherland"" with her arms held high. The whole complex will be taken down. Latvia, which shares a 214-kilometer (133-mile) border with Russia, has a large group of ethnic Russians living in the country. On Russia's annual Victory Day holiday on May 9, they gather in front of the monument to lay flowers with concerts also organized.

(AP Photo/Roman Koksarov, File) The event has caused controversy among people in Latvia, which since regaining independence in 1991 has become a member of NATO and the European Union. Over the weekend, the Latvian Russian Union said it plans to stage a protest on Monday evening. The group says it has gathered more than 10,000 signatures of people who are against removing the monument, the Baltic News Service said. But Lange told a news conference Monday that the Riga City Council said it won't issue permission for them to hold a protest. In May, Lativa's parliament voted to pave the way for the demolition of the monument in the capital and the Riga City Council followed suit. The Baltic countries have removed many monuments glorifying the Soviet Union or communist leaders. In 2007, the relocation of a World War II monument of a Red Army soldier in Estonia's capital, Tallinn, sparked days of rioting. Last week, Estonia removed a Soviet-era monument with a tank on top outside the town of Narva in the Baltic country's Russian-speaking east, and moved the tank replica to a war museum north of Tallinn. Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania have taken a hard-line stance against Russia´s invasion of Ukraine. ___ Follow the AP´s coverage of the war at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine"

At a veteran's event, Ukraine´s military chief, Gen. Valerii Zaluzhnyi, said many of Ukraine´s children need to be taken care of because ""their father went to the front line and, perhaps, is one of those almost 9,000 heroes who died."" In Nikopol, across the river from Ukraine's main nuclear power plant, Russian shelling wounded four people Monday, an official said. The city on the Dnieper River has faced relentless pounding since July 12 that has damaged 850 buildings and sent about half its population of 100,000 fleeing. ""I feel hate towards Russians,"" said 74-year-old Liudmyla Shyshkina, standing on the edge of her destroyed fourth-floor apartment in Nikopol that no longer has walls.

The U.N. children´s agency said Monday that at least 972 Ukrainian children have been killed or injured since Russia invaded.

(AP Photo/Evgeniy Maloletka) U.S. President Joe Biden and the leaders of Britain, France and Germany pleaded Sunday for Russia to end military operations so close to the Zaporizhzhya nuclear plant - Europe's largest - but Nikopol came under fire three times overnight from rockets and mortar shells. Houses, a kindergarten, a bus station and stores were hit, authorities said. There are widespread fears that continued shelling and fighting in the area could lead to a nuclear catastrophe. Russia has asked for an urgent meeting of the U.N. Security Council on Tuesday to discuss the situation - a move ""the audacity"" of which Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy decried in his evening video address. ""The total number of different Russian cruise missiles that Russia used against us is approaching 3,500. It is simply impossible to count the strikes of Russian artillery; there are so many of them, and they are so intense,"" Zelensky said Monday. Western nations had already scheduled a council meeting on Wednesday -- the six-month anniversary of the Russian invasion -- on its impact on Ukraine. Vladimir Rogov, an official with the Russia-installed administration of the occupied Zaporizhzhia region, claimed that because of shelling from Ukraine, staffing at the nuclear plant had been cut sharply. Ukrainians say Russia is storing weapons at the plant and has blocked off areas to Ukrainian nuclear workers. Monday's announcement of the scope of Ukraine's military dead stands in sharp contrast to Russia's military, which last gave an update on March 25 when it said 1,351 Russian troops were killed during the first month of fighting. U.S. military officials estimated two weeks ago that Russia has lost between 70,000 to 80,000 soldiers, both killed and wounded in action. On Monday though, Moscow turned its attention to one specific civilian death. Russia blamed Ukrainian spy agencies for the weekend car bombing on the outskirts of Moscow that killed the daughter of a far-right Russian nationalist who ardently supports the invasion of Ukraine. Russia´s Federal Security Service, the main successor to the KGB, said Monday the killing was ""prepared and perpetrated by the Ukrainian special services."" It charged that the bombing that killed 29-year-old TV commentator Darya Dugina, whose father, political theorist Alexander Dugin, is often referred to as ""Putin´s brain,"" was carried out by a Ukrainian citizen who left Russia for Estonia quickly afterward. Ukrainian officials have vehemently denied any involvement in the car bombing. Estonian officials say Russia has not asked them to look for the alleged bomber or even spoken to them about the bombing. On the front lines, the Ukraine military said it carried out a strike on a key bridge over the Dnieper River in the Russian-occupied Kherson region. Local Russia-installed officials said the strike killed two people Monday and wounded 16 others. Photos on social media showed thick plumes of smoke rising over the Antonivskiy Bridge, an important supply route for the Russian military in Kherson. On the Russian-occupied Crimean Peninsula, anxiety has been spreading following a spate of fires and explosions at Russian facilities over the past two weeks. The Russian-backed governor of Sevastopol, Mikhail Razvozhaev, ordered that signs showing the location of bomb shelters be placed in the city, which had long seemed untouchable. Razvozhaev said on Telegram the city is well-protected but ""it is better to know where the shelters are."" Sevastopol, the Crimean port that is the home of Russia´s Black Sea Fleet, has seen a series of drone attacks. A drone exploded at the fleet´s headquarters on July 31, and another was shot down over it last week. Authorities said air-defense systems have shot down other drones as well. On Monday evening, Sevastopol residents reported hearing loud explosions on social media. Razvozhaev said the air-defense system had shot down ""an object ... at high altitude."" ""Preliminary (conclusion) is that it is, again, a drone,"" he wrote on Telegram. Russian President Vladimir Putin didn't directly mention the war during a speech Monday marking National Flag Day but echoed some of the justifications cited for the invasion. ""We are firm in pursuing in the international arena only those policies that meet the fundamental interests of the motherland,"" Putin said.

She believed the war would end quickly and she would be home by May. But a half-year later, with shelling near a nuclear power plant in her hometown of Zaporizhzhia, and the front line so close, the 36-year-old's husband is telling her to stay in Poland with their now-11-month-old baby. She now dreams of being home by winter, hoping Ukraine will have prevailed by then against Russia's onslaught. As the war reaches the sixth-month mark Wednesday, hundreds of thousands of refugees have returned to Ukraine already. But others are facing the sad realization that they will not be going home soon, if they have homes to return to at all. With missiles falling even far from the front line, many wouldn't feel safe yet, even in areas under Ukrainian control. So they are biding their time, waiting for the end of a war that shows no signs of ending soon, longing for home and refusing to think too far into the future. With a new academic year starting, some are reluctantly enrolling their children in schools abroad, worried they will fall behind. Others take jobs below their skill levels. With most refugees being women, those with very young children, like Mokrozub, are often unable to work. ""It seems to me that not only for me but for all Ukrainians, time has stopped,"" Mokrozub said. ""We all live in some kind of limbo.""

As Russia's war against Ukraine reaches the sixth-month mark, many refugees are coming to the bitter realization that they will not be returning home soon. With shelling around a nuclear power plant and missiles threatening even western regions of Ukraine, many refugees don't feel safe at home, even if those areas are under Ukrainian control. (AP Photo/Michal Dyjuk) Russia´s invasion has created the largest refugee crisis in Europe since World War II. The UN refugee agency says a third of Ukrainians have fled their homes, with more than 6.6 million displaced within the country and over 6.6 million more across the continent. European countries have welcomed them without the political backlash that met influxes of refugees from the Middle East and Africa in past years, however. Poland has taken in the most Ukrainians, with an estimated 1.5 million having registered for national ID numbers that allow them social benefits. Germany, which doesn't require visas for Ukrainians, has registered more than 900,000, though it isn't clear how many of those may have gone home or headed elsewhere. Warsaw now has 180,000 Ukrainian refugees - representing a tenth of the Polish capital's population of 1.8 million - the largest single grouping anywhere. Though Ukrainian and Russian - which is also commonly spoken back home - are heard on the city's streets and grocery stores now carry some Ukrainian foods, the newcomers have integrated with little trouble and seem almost invisible. For many of the refugees, Poland's Slavic language and culture offer something familiar and reassuring. The country's proximity to Ukraine makes it possible to travel back for short visits with husbands and fathers who are banned from leaving due to the war effort. ""We didn't want to go farther,"" said Galina Inyutina, 42, who arrived in Poland in early March from Dnipro with her 11-year-old son. They long terribly for their forests and fields and food. ""Mom, if we go farther away then it will take us longer to get home,"" he told her. The arrival of so many people has exacerbated a preexisting housing crisis in Warsaw, where rental prices have surged 30% over the last year, as well as other cities that have attracted large numbers of refugees. In the early days of the war, hundreds of thousands of Polish families took Ukrainians, often total strangers, into their homes. Thanks to that hospitality, there was never a need for refugee camps, said Oksana Pestrykova, who administers a consultation center at the Ukrainian House in Warsaw, a social center for immigrants. But what were expected to be short stays have turned into long ones, and some Poles are now calling the center's hotline to ask for help from Ukrainian speakers to tell their guests it's time to move on. ""The hospitality is getting weaker,"" Pestrykova said. ""We understand it and we were expecting it."" Some corporations are stepping in to help. The global tech company Siemens transformed office space at its Polish headquarters to create hotel-style accommodations for nearly 160 people, administered by the Warsaw city government. The facility is clean, with food and laundry facilities provided for free. Among those living there now is Ludmila Fedotova, a 52-year-old shop assistant from Zaporizhzhia. She is terrified about what is happening back home but can at least relax knowing she has housing and food as she looks for work. While there might not be enough housing for all the newcomers, there are more than enough jobs in an economy that has boomed in the post-communist era. Ukrainian immigrants who came to Poland in recent years are sometimes the ones helping the new arrivals with work and a place to live. Oleh Yarovyi, from Khmelnytskyi in western Ukraine, arrived six years ago and has built up a coffee shop franchise with his wife. As they expand, he has lost some Ukrainian men helping with construction who returned to fight in the war, but he has been able to hire Ukrainian women who can use their language in a job they hope is temporary. ""Half of them plan to go back, so they don´t even try to learn Polish,"" Yarovyi said. ""They just look for a simple job without any additional challenges."" Tetiana Bilous, 46, who ran a short-term apartment rental business in Vinnytsia, Ukraine, is among those working in one of Yarovyi´s kitchens. She fled two days into the war, joining a grown daughter already in Warsaw. She missed her husband and returned home for a two-week visit, but was terrified by the bombardments and air raid sirens. Bilous remains torn over what her next steps should be, saying, ""Everything is uncertain."" Farther west, in Schwerin, Germany, Marina Galla, a computer science teacher who left Mariupol with her 13-year-old son in late March, has found relief and stability. Last month they moved into a small rooftop apartment after a long escape that took them through Poland and Berlin. She is free from the horrors and the deprivation from which she fled: the bodies in the streets, drinking melted snow because there was no running water. Yet she feels crushed with sadness thinking of family left behind. In a black backpack she has carried every day since leaving Mariupol, Galla keeps a handwritten note in a side pocket listing contact information for her mother, father and grandmother. She originally wrote it in case she was killed in the war, and even in the safety of Schwerin, she doesn't leave home without it. Her son messaged a lot with his friends from back home during their first months in Germany, but he barely talks to them anymore and has stopped asking her when they will return to Ukraine. ""He probably understands,"" Galla said, ""that we will not be able to go back there."" ___ Follow the AP´s coverage of the war at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine Valentyna, a Ukrainian refugee from the Lviv area, works on a self-portrait in a room at a refugee shelter in Warsaw, Poland, Wednesday, Aug. 17, 2022.

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-11133505/Fate-Ukrainian-lands-held-Russia-unclear.html,2022-08-22,Fate of Ukrainian lands held by Russia still seems unclear,"According to Russian state TV, the future of the Ukrainian regions captured by Moscow's forces is all but decided: Referendums on becoming part of Russia will soon take place there, and the joyful residents who were abandoned by Kyiv will be able to prosper in peace. In reality, the Kremlin appears to be in no rush to seal the deal on Ukraine's southern regions of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia and the eastern provinces of Donetsk and Luhansk, even though officials it installed there already have announced plans for a vote to join Russia. As the war in Ukraine nears its six-month mark, Moscow faces multiple problems in the territory it occupies -- from pulverized civilian infrastructure that needs urgent rebuilding as colder weather looms, to guerrilla resistance and increasingly debilitating attacks by Kyiv's military forces that have been gearing up for a counteroffensive in the south. Analysts say that what could have been a clear victory for the Kremlin is becoming something of a muddle. ""It is clear that the situation won´t stabilize for a long time,"" even if referendums eventually are held, says Nikolai Petrov, a senior research fellow in Chatham House´s Russia and Eurasia Program. ""There will be the guerrilla movement, there will be underground resistance, there will be terrorist acts, there will be shelling. ... Right now, the impression is that even the Kremlin doesn´t really believe that by holding these referendums, it would draw a thick line under it."" Moscow´s plans to incorporate captured territories were clear from the outset of the Feb. 24 invasion. Several weeks in, separatist leaders of the self-proclaimed ""people's republics"" of Donetsk and Luhansk, which the Kremlin recognized as independent states, voiced plans to hold votes on becoming part of Russia. While forces backed by Moscow control almost all of Luhansk, some estimates say Russia and the separatists control about 60% of the Donetsk region.

In reality, the Kremlin appears to be in no rush to seal the deal on Ukraine's southern regions of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia and the eastern provinces of Donetsk and Luhansk. (AP Photo/Alexei Alexandrov) Similar announcements followed from Kremlin-backed administrations of the southern Kherson region, which is almost completely occupied by Russians, and in the Zaporizhzhia region, large swaths of which are under Moscow´s control. While the Kremlin coyly says it is up to the residents to decide whether they formally want to live in Russia or Ukraine, lower-level officials talked about possible dates for the balloting. Senior lawmaker Leonid Slutksy once mentioned July, although it did not occur. Vladimir Rogov, a Moscow-installed official in the Zaporizhzhia region, suggested the first half of September. Kirill Stremousov, a Kremlin-backed official in Kherson, talked about scheduling it before the end of the year. As summer wanes, there is still no date for the referendums. Pro-Russian officials in Kherson and Zaporizhzhia say the votes will take place after Moscow takes full control of the rest of the Donetsk region, but the Kremlin's gains there have been minimal recently. Still, campaigns promoting the votes are reportedly well underway. Russian TV shows cities with billboards proclaiming, ""Together with Russia."" Stremousov reports from Kherson almost daily on social media about his trips around the region, where he meets people adamant about joining Russia. In the Russian-controlled part of Zaporizhzhia, the Moscow-installed administration already has ordered an election commission to prepare for a referendum. Balloting aside, there are other signs that Russia is planning on staying. The ruble has been introduced alongside the Ukrainian hryvnia and has been used to pay out pensions and other benefits. Russian passports were offered to residents in a fast-track citizenship procedure. Schools were reported to have switched to a Russian curriculum, starting in September. Russian license plates were given to car owners by traffic police, with Kherson and Zaporizhzhia assigned Russian region numbers 184 and 185. The Russian Interior Ministry, which oversees the traffic police, did not responded to an Associated Press request for comment to clarify how that was legal, given that both regions are still part of Ukraine. Ukrainian officials and activists, meanwhile, paint a picture that contrasts sharply with the Russian TV portrayal of a bright future for the occupied territories under Moscow´s generous care. Luhansk Gov. Serhiy Haidai told AP that 90% of the population in the province´s large cities has left. Devastation and squalor ""reigns"" in the cities and towns seized by Russia, he said, and there are only a few villages not under Moscow's control after weeks of exhausting battles. Residents use ""water from puddles"" and build ""a bonfire in the yard to cook food on, right next to garbage, Haidai said. ""Our people that manage to return home to collect their belongings don´t recognize towns and villages that used to blossom,"" he added. The situation isn't as dire in the southern city of Kherson, which sits just north of the Crimean Peninsula that Moscow annexed from Ukraine in 2014, according to pro-Ukrainian activist Konstantin Ryzhenko. Kherson was captured without much destruction early in the war, so most of its infrastructure is intact. But supplies of essential goods have been uneven, and prices for food and medicine brought in from Russia have spiked, Ryzhenko told AP, adding that both are of ""disgustingly low quality."" Early in the war, thousands of Kherson residents regularly protested the occupation, but mass repressions forced many either to flee the city or to hide their views. ""Demonstrations have been impossible since May. If you publicly express anything pro-Ukrainian, an opinion on whatever subject, you are guaranteed to be taken into detention, tortured and beaten there,"" Ryzhenko said. Melitopol Mayor Ivan Fedorov, whose city in the Zaporizhzhia region also was occupied early in the war, echoed Ryzhenko´s sentiment. Mass arrests and purges of activists and opinion-makers with pro-Kyiv views began in May, said Fedorov, who spent time in Russian captivity for refusing to cooperate. More than 500 people in Melitopol remain in captivity, he told AP. Despite that intimidation, he estimated that only about 10% of those who remain in the city would vote to join Russia if a referendum takes place. ""The idea of a referendum has discredited itself,"" Fedorov said. Kherson activist Ryzhenko believes a referendum would be rigged because ""they´re already talking about voting online, voting at home. ... So, you understand, the legitimacy of this voting will be nil."" Russian political analyst Dmitry Oreshkin said that because so many people have left the occupied regions, ""there will be nothing close to a proper polling of the population about their preferences."" But Ukrainian authorities still have to regard such votes as a serious issue, said Vadim Karasev, head of the Kyiv-based Institute of Global Strategies think tank. ""After the referendums take place, Russia will consider the southern lands as part of its own territory and view Ukrainian attacks as attacks on Russia,"" Karasev said in an interview. He said the Kremlin might also be using the threat of referendums to pressure Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to agree to negotiations on Moscow´s conditions or else risk ""losing the south"" and a large part of its vital access to the sea. Zelenskyy has said that if Moscow goes ahead with the votes, there will be no talks of any kind. In the meantime, Ukrainian forces continue sporadic strikes against the Russian military in the Kherson region. On Thursday, Ukraine´s Operational Command South reported killing 29 ""occupiers"" near the town of Bilohirka, northeast of Kherson, as well as destroying artillery, armored vehicles and a military supply depot. -- Follow the AP´s coverage of the war at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine FILE - People who fled from Mariupol, a few of them from the Azovstal steel plant, arrive by bus to a reception center for displaced people in Zaporizhzhia, Ukraine, on May 8, 2022.

Korea open biggest drills in years amid North threats","The United States and South Korea began their biggest combined military training in years Monday as they heighten their defense posture against the growing North Korean nuclear threat. The drills could draw an angry response from North Korea, which has dialed up its weapons testing activity to a record pace this year while repeatedly threatening conflicts with Seoul and Washington amid a prolonged stalemate in diplomacy. The Ulchi Freedom Shield exercises will continue through Sept. 1 in South Korea and include field exercises involving aircraft, warships, tanks and potentially tens of thousands of troops. While Washington and Seoul describe their exercises as defensive, North Korea portrays them as invasion rehearsals and has used them to justify its nuclear weapons and missiles development. Ulchi Freedom Shield, which started along with a four-day South Korean civil defense training program led by government employees, will reportedly include exercises simulating joint attacks, front-line reinforcements of arms and fuel, and removals of weapons of mass destruction. The allies will also train for drone attacks and other new developments in warfare shown during Russia´s war on Ukraine and practice joint military-civilian responses to attacks on seaports, airports and major industrial facilities such as semiconductor factories.

The United States and South Korea began their biggest combined military training in years Monday as they heighten their defense posture against the growing North Korean nuclear threat. (AP Photo/Ahn Young-joon) The United States and South Korea in past years had canceled some of their regular drills and downsized others to computer simulations to create space for the Trump administration´s diplomacy with North Korea and because of COVID-19 concerns. Tensions have grown since the collapse of the second meeting between former President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in early 2019. The Americans then rejected North Korean demands for a major release of crippling U.S.-led sanctions in exchange for dismantling an aging nuclear complex, which would have amounted to a partial surrender of the North´s nuclear capabilities. Kim has since vowed to bolster his nuclear deterrent in face of ""gangster-like"" U.S. pressure. South Korea´s military has not revealed the number of South Korean and U.S. troops participating in Ulchi Freedom Shield, but has portrayed the training as a message of strength. Seoul's Defense Ministry said last week that Ulchi Freedom Shield ""normalizes"" large-scale training and field exercises between the allies to help bolster their alliance and strengthen their defense posture against the evolving North Korean threat. Before being shelved or downsized, the United States and South Korea held major joint exercises every spring and summer in South Korea. The spring drills had included live-fire drills involving a broad range of land, air and sea assets and usually involved around 10,000 American and 200,000 Korean troops. Tens of thousands of allied troops participated in the summertime drills, which mainly consisted of computer simulations to hone joint decision-making and planning, although South Korea´s military has emphasized the revival of field training this year. The drills follow North Korea´s dismissal last week of South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol´s ""audacious"" proposal of economic benefits in exchange for denuclearization steps, accusing Seoul of recycling proposals Pyongyang has long rejected. Kim Yo Jong, the increasingly powerful sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, described Yoon´s proposal as foolish and stressed that the North has no intentions to give away an arsenal her brother clearly sees as his strongest guarantee of survival. She harshly criticized Yoon for continuing military exercises with the United States and also for letting South Korean civilian activists fly anti-Pyongyang propaganda leaflets and other ""dirty waste"" across the border by balloon. She also ridiculed U.S.-South Korean military capabilities for monitoring the North´s missile activity, insisting that the South misread the launch site of the North´s latest missile tests on Wednesday last week, hours before Yoon used a news conference to urge Pyongyang to return to diplomacy. Kim Yo Jong´s statement came a week after she warned of ""deadly"" retaliation against South Korea over a recent North Korean COVID-19 outbreak, which Pyongyang dubiously claims was caused by leaflets and other objects floated by southern activists. There are concerns that the threat portends a provocation which might include a nuclear or missile test or even border skirmishes, and that the North might try to raise tensions sometime around the allied drills. In an interview with Associated Press Television last month, Choe Jin, deputy director of a think tank run by North Korea´s Foreign Ministry, said the United States and South Korea would face ""unprecedented"" security challenges if they don´t drop their hostile military pressure campaign against North Korea, including joint military drills. Last week´s launches of two suspected cruise missiles extended a record pace in North Korean missile testing in 2022, which has involved more than 30 ballistic launches, including the country´s first demonstrations of intercontinental ballistic missiles in nearly five years. North Korea´s heighted testing activity underscores its dual intent to advance its arsenal and force the United States to accept the idea of the North as a nuclear power so it can negotiate economic and security concessions from a position of strength, experts say. Kim Jong Un could up the ante soon as there are indications that the North is preparing to conduct its first nuclear test since September 2017, when it claimed to have developed a thermonuclear weapon to fit on its ICBMs. South Korean army K-9 self-propelled howitzers take positions in Paju, near the border with North Korea, South Korea, Monday, Aug. 22, 2022.

The 21-year-old Kvaratskhelia, who also scored on his league debut in Napoli´s 5-2 win at Hellas Verona, took his tally to three goals in two games since joining from Dinamo Batumi. Kvaratskhelia had been playing for Russian team Rubin Kazan up to March, but joined Batumi following Russia´s invasion of Ukraine. Napoli dominated the opening half in its first league game at home this season, but its fans had to wait till the 35th minute for Kvaratskhelia to unlock the Monza defense with a curling shot inside the right post from distance. Victor Osimhen raced down the right and held off a defender to make it 2-0 in first-half injury time. Osimhen headed just over after the break before Kvaratskhelia produced another moment of brilliance to score in the 62nd. Facing two defenders, he eluded both before firing inside the far post. Andrea Petagna thought he´d pulled one back for Monza but the goal was ruled out through VAR for a foul.

(Spada/LaPresse via AP) South Korea defender Kim Min-jae wrapped up the scoring with a header in the third minute of injury time. MILAN FRUSTRATED Milan was frustrated by a stubborn defense from Gian Piero Gasperini´s Atalanta team, which seized the lead through Ruslan Malinovskyi´s fierce shot in the 29th. Joakim Maehle played the ball back for the Ukrainian to unleash the ball with his favored left foot past Milan goalkeeper Mike Maignan with the help of a slight deflection. Malinovskyi´s inclusion in the starting lineup was a surprise amid transfer speculation linking him to Tottenham, Nottingham Forest and Marseille. Reports had also suggested he was no longer in favor with the coach. Gasperini´s team was forced back for much of the game, but his defense managed to keep most of the danger at bay as the visitors struggled to break through. Maignan denied Mario Pasalic with a good save early in the second half, before his Atalanta counterpart Juan Musso did brilliantly to deny Sandro Tonali in a one-on-one. The Milan midfielder should have scored. The visitors´ pressure eventually paid off when Ismael Bennacer equalized with a brilliant shot in off the far post in the 68th. Fiorentina drew at Empoli 0-0 in their Tuscan derby. Empoli defender Sebastiano Luperto was sent off in the 66th for a tactical foul on Luka Jovic. Empoli finished the game with nine players because of an injury to Nicolo Cambiaghi. Also, Bologna drew with Verona 1-1. ___ More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports Ismael Bennacer of Milan kicks the ball for the 1-1 goal during the Italian Serie A soccer match between Atalanta and AC Milan at the Gewiss Stadium, Bergamo, Italy, Sunday, Aug. 21, 2022.

The fiery televised address to his nation by President Aleksandar Vucic followed the collapse of political talks between Serbian and Kosovo leaders earlier this week mediated by the European Union in Brussels. Serbia, along with its allies Russia and China, has refused to recognize Kosovo's 2008 declaration of independence. A NATO-led intervention in 1999 ended the war between Serbian forces and separatists in Kosovo and stopped Belgrade´s bloody crackdown against Kosovo's majority Albanians. The EU has overseen years of unsuccessful talks to normalize their ties, saying that´s one of the main preconditions for Kosovo and Serbia´s eventual membership in the 27-nation bloc. ""We have nowhere to go, we are cornered,"" Vucic said. ""We will save our people from persecution and pogroms, if NATO does not want to do it."" He also claimed that Kosovo Albanian ""gangs"" need to be stopped from crossing into northern Kosovo, where most of the Kosovo Serbs live. He offered no proof for the claim. Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic addresses the nation at a news conference in Belgrade, Serbia, Sunday, Aug. 21, 2022. Vucic has called on NATO on Sunday to ""do their job"" in Kosovo, or Serbia will have to protect its minority in the breakaway province. Address to his nation by Aleksandar Vucic followed the collapse of political talks between Serbian and Kosovo leaders mediated earlier this week by the European Union in Brussels. (AP Photo/Darko Vojinovic) There are widespread fears in the West that Russia could encourage its ally Serbia into an armed intervention in northern Kosovo that would further destabilize the Balkans and shift at least some world and NATO attention from Russia´s war in Ukraine. Nearly 4,000 NATO-led peacekeepers have been stationed in Kosovo following the 1998-99 war and any armed intervention there by Serbia or Russia would mean a major escalation of a simmering conflict in Europe. Following the collapse of the EU-mediated talks, NATO peacekeeping troops in Kosovo have been deployed at main roads in its north, saying they are ready to protect the freedom of movement for all sides. Tensions between Serbia and Kosovo soared anew last month when the Kosovo government led by Prime Minister Albin Kurti declared that Serbian identity documents and vehicle license plates would no longer be valid in Kosovo´s territory. Serbia has been implementing the same measures for Kosovo citizens crossing into Serbia for the past 10 years. Minority Serbs in Kosovo reacted with anger to the proposed changes, putting up roadblocks, sounding air raid sirens and firing guns into the air and in the direction of Kosovo police officers. No one was injured. Under apparent pressure from the West, Kurti postponed implementation of the measure for a month to Sept. 1, when more trouble is expected if a compromise is not reached by then. Vucic said Serbia will ""work hard"" to reach a ""compromise solution in the next 10 days"" and accused the Kosovo leadership of ""only being interested in abolishing any trace of the Serbian state in Kosovo."" Vucic also claimed, again without proof, that Kosovo's government wanted ""the final removal of the Serbian people from Kosovo"" - something that has been repeatedly denied by Kosovo officials. Kosovo Interior Minister Xhelal Svecla on Sunday visited Kosovo police units stationed near the northern border with Serbia, saying that he hopes there will be no trouble when the new measures begin on Sept.1. ""Our common interest here is that this land is ours and we will not give it up at any price,"" he said. __ AP writer Jovana Gec contributed.

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-11131465/On-Ukraine-s-line-fight-save-premature-babies.html,2022-08-21,"On Ukraine´s front line, a fight to save premature babies","Echoing down the corridors of eastern Ukraine's Pokrovsk Perinatal Hospital are the loud cries of tiny Veronika. Born nearly two months prematurely weighing 1.5 kilograms (3 pounds, 4 ounces), the infant receives oxygen through a nasal tube to help her breathe while ultraviolet lamps inside an incubator treat her jaundice. Dr. Tetiana Myroshnychenko carefully connects the tubes that allow Veronika to feed on her mother´s stored breast milk and ease her hunger. Before Russia´s invasion of Ukraine in late February, three hospitals in government-controlled areas of the country´s war-torn Donetsk region had facilities to care for premature babies. One was hit by a Russian airstrike and the other had to close as a result of the fighting - leaving only the maternity hospital in the coal mining town of Pokrovsk still operating. Myroshnychenko, the site´s only remaining neonatologist, now lives at the hospital. Her 3-year-old son divides the week between staying at the facility and with his father, a coal miner, at home. The doctor explains why it´s now impossible to leave: Even when the air-raid sirens sound, the babies in the hospital's above-ground incubation ward cannot be disconnected from their lifesaving machines. Dr. Tetiana Myroshnychenko, a neonatologist at Pokrovsk Perinatal Hospital, checks on Veronika, a baby born nearly two months prematurely, in Pokrovsk, Donetsk region, eastern Ukraine, Monday, Aug. 15, 2022. In Ukraine's war-torn eastern Donetsk region, only one hospital under government control remains equipped to care for babies born prematurely in government-held areas. Doctors say the stress caused by the war and rapidly worsening living conditions are leading to more frequent birth complications for the area's pregnant women. (AP Photo/David Goldman) ""If I carry Veronika to the shelter, that would take five minutes. But for her, those five minutes could be critical,"" Myroshnychenko says. Hospital officials say the proportion of births occurring prematurely or with complications has roughly doubled this year compared to previous times, blaming stress and rapidly worsening living standards for taking a toll on the pregnant women still left in the area. Russia and Moscow-backed separatists now occupy just over half the Donetsk region, which is similar in size to Sicily or Massachusetts. Pokrovsk is still in a Ukrainian government-controlled area 60 kilometers (40 miles) west of the front lines. Inside the hospital's maternity wards, talk of the war is discouraged. ""Everything that happens outside this building of course concerns us, but we don´t talk about it,"" Myroshnychenko said. ""Their main concern right now is the baby."" Although fighting in the Dontesk region started back in 2014, when Russia-backed separatists began battling the government and taking over parts of the region, new mothers are only now being kept in the hospital for longer periods because there's little opportunity for them to receive care once they have been discharged. Among them is 23-year-old Inna Kyslychenko, from Pokrovsk. Rocking her 2-day-old daughter Yesenia, she was considering joining the region´s massive evacuation westward to safer areas in Ukraine when she leaves the hospital. Many essential services in government-held areas of the Donetsk region - heat, electricity, water supplies - have been damaged by Russian bombardment, leaving living conditions that are only expected to worsen as the winter grows near. ""I fear for the little lives, not only for ours, but for all the children, for all of Ukraine,"" Kyslychenko said. More than 12 million people in Ukraine have fled their homes due to the war, according to U.N. relief agencies. About half have been displaced within Ukraine and the rest have moved to other European countries. Moving the maternity hospital out of Pokrovsk, however, is not an option. ""If the hospital was relocated, the patients would still have to remain here,"" said chief physician Dr. Ivan Tsyganok, who kept working even when the town was being hit by Russian rocket fire. ""Delivering babies is not something that can be stopped or rescheduled,"" he noted. The nearest existing maternity facility is in Ukraine's neighboring Dnipropetrovsk region, a 3 1/2 hour drive along secondary roads, a journey considered too risky for women in late-term pregnancy. Last week, 24-year-old Andrii Dobrelia and his wife Maryna, 27, reached the hospital from a nearby village. Looking anxious, they talked little as doctors carried out a series of tests and then led Maryna to the operating room for a C-section. Tsyganok and his colleagues hurriedly changed their clothes and prepared for the procedure. Twenty minutes later, the cries of a newborn baby boy, Timur, could be heard. After an examination, Timur was taken to meet his father in an adjoining room. Almost afraid to breathe, Andrii Dobrelia tenderly kissed Timur´s head and whispered to him. As the newborn calmed down on his father´s chest, tears came to Andrii´s eyes. As the war reaches the six-month mark, Tsyganok and his colleagues says they have a more hopeful reason to stay. ""These children we are bringing into the world will be the future of Ukraine,"" says Tsyganok. ""I think their lives will be different to ours. They will live outside war."" ___ Follow AP´s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine Alina Haupt, an intern-doctor, holds Veronika, a baby born prematurely at 29 weeks, at the Pokrovsk Perinatal Hospital in Pokrovsk, Donetsk region, eastern Ukraine, Monday, Aug. 15, 2022.

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-11131419/Daughter-Putins-brain-ideologist-killed-car-blast.html,2022-08-21,Car blast kills daughter of Russian known as 'Putin's brain',"The daughter of an influential Russian political theorist often referred to as ""Putin´s brain"" was killed in a car bombing on the outskirts of Moscow, authorities said Sunday. The Moscow branch of the Russian Investigative Committee said preliminary information indicated 29-year-old TV commentator Daria Dugina was killed by an explosive planted in the SUV she was driving Saturday night. There was no immediate claim of responsibility. But the bloodshed gave rise to suspicions that the intended target was her father, Alexander Dugin, a nationalist philosopher and writer. Dugin is a prominent proponent of the ""Russian world"" concept, a spiritual and political ideology that emphasizes traditional values, the restoration of Russia´s power and the unity of all ethnic Russians throughout the world. He is also a vehement supporter of Russian President Vladimir Putin's move sending troops into Ukraine. The explosion took place as his daughter was returning from a cultural festival she had attended with him. Russian media reports cited witnesses as saying the SUV belonged to Dugin and that he had decided at the last minute to travel in another vehicle. The car bombing, unusual for Moscow, is likely to aggravate tensions between Russia and Ukraine. In this handout photo taken from video released by Investigative Committee of Russia on Sunday, Aug. 21, 2022, investigators work on the site of explosion of a car driven by Daria Dugina outside Moscow. Daria Dugina, the daughter of Alexander Dugin, the Russian nationalist ideologist often called ""Putin's brain"", was killed when her car exploded on the outskirts of Moscow, officials said Sunday. The Investigate Committee branch for the Moscow region said the Saturday night blast was caused by a bomb planted in the SUV driven by Daria Dugina.(Investigative Committee of Russia via AP) Denis Pushilin, president of the separatist Donetsk People´s Republic, the pro-Moscow region that is a focus of Russia´s fighting in Ukraine, blamed the blast on ""terrorists of the Ukrainian regime, trying to kill Alexander Dugin."" Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, denied Ukrainian involvement, saying, ""We are not a criminal state, unlike Russia, and definitely not a terrorist state."" Political analyst Abbas Gallyamov, a former speechwriter for Putin, called the attack ""an act of intimidation"" aimed at Kremlin loyalists. To them, he said, ""this is a symbolic act, demonstrating that hostilities have been confidently transferred to the territory of Russia, which means that this is no longer an abstract war that you watch on TV,"" he said. ""This is already happening in Russia. Not only Crimea is being bombed, but terrorist attacks are already being carried out in the Moscow region."" While Dugin's exact ties to Putin are unclear, the Kremlin frequently echoes rhetoric from his writings and appearances on Russian state TV. He helped popularize the ""Novorossiya,"" or ""New Russia"" concept that Russia used to justify the 2014 annexation of Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula and its support of separatist rebels in eastern Ukraine. He promotes Russia as a country of piety, traditional values and authoritarian leadership, and disdains Western liberal values. His daughter expressed similar views and had appeared as a commentator on the nationalist TV channel Tsargrad, where Dugin had served as chief editor. Dugina herself was sanctioned by the United States in March for her work as chief editor of United World International, a website that the U.S. described as a disinformation source. The sanctions announcement cited a United World article this year that contended Ukraine would ""perish"" if it were admitted to NATO. In an appearance on Russian television just Thursday, Dugina said, ""People in the West are living in a dream, in a dream given to them by global hegemony."" She called America ""a zombie society"" in which people opposed Russia but could not find it on a map. Dugina, ""like her father, has always been at the forefront of confrontation with the West,"" Tsargrad said Sunday. An unknown Russian group, the National Republican Army, claimed responsibility Sunday for the bombing, according to a former Russian lawmaker, Ilya Ponomarev. The AP could not verify the existence of the group. Ponomarev, who left Russia after voting against its annexation of Crimea in 2014, made the statement to Ukrainian TV.

Zinkpower's facility outside Bonn uses gas to keep 600 tons of zinc worth 2.5 million euros ($2.5 million) in a molten state every day. The metal will harden otherwise, wrecking the tank where steel parts are dipped before they end up in car suspensions, buildings, solar panels and wind turbines. Six months after Russia invaded Ukraine, the consequences are posing a devastating threat to the global economy, including companies like Zinkpower, which employs 2,800 people. Gas is not only much more costly, it might not be available at all if Russia completely cuts off supplies to Europe to avenge Western sanctions, or if utilities can't store enough for winter. Germany may have to impose gas rationing that could cripple industries from steelmaking to pharmaceuticals to commercial laundries. ""If they say, we're cutting you off, all my equipment will be destroyed,"" said Kopf, who' also chairs Germany´s association of zinc galvanizing firms. Governments, businesses and families worldwide are feeling the war's economic effects just two years after the coronavirus pandemic ravaged global trade. Inflation is soaring, and rocketing energy costs have raised the prospect of a cold, dark winter. Europe stands at the brink of recession.

Though intertwined with other forces, the war has made problems like inflation much worse for people around the world. In Bangkok, rising costs for pork, vegetables and oil have forced Warunee Deejai, a street-food vendor, to raise prices, cut staff and work longer hours. (AP Photo/Sakchai Lalit) Outside Uganda's capital of Kampala, Rachel Gamisha said Russia's war in faraway Ukraine has hurt her grocery business. She has felt it in surging prices for necessities like gasoline, selling for $6.90 a gallon. Something that's 2,000 shillings (about $16.70) this week may cost 3,000 shillings ($25) next week. ""You have to limit yourself,´´ she said. ""You have to buy a few things that move fast.´´ Gamisha has noticed something else, too - a phenomenon called ""shrinkflation"": A price may not change, but a doughnut that used to weigh 45 grams may now be only 35 grams. Bread that weighed 1 kilogram is now 850 grams. Russia's war led the International Monetary Fund last month to downgrade its outlook for the global economy for the fourth time in under a year. The lending agency expects 3.2% growth this year, down from the 4.9% it forecast in July 2021 and well below a vigorous 6.1% last year. ""The world may soon be teetering on the edge of a global recession, only two years after the last one,"" Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, the IMF's chief economist, said. The U.N. Development Program said rising food and energy prices threw 71 million people worldwide into poverty in the first three months of the war. Countries in the Balkans and sub-Saharan Africa were hit hardest. Up to 181 million people in 41 countries could suffer a hunger crisis this year, the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization has projected. In Bangkok, rising costs for pork, vegetables and oil have forced Warunee Deejai, a street-food vendor, to raise prices, cut staff and work longer hours. ""I don´t know how long I can keep my lunch price affordable,´´ she said. ""Coming out from COVID lockdowns and having to face this is tough. Worse is, I don´t see the end of it.´´ Even before Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered the invasion of Ukraine, the global economy was under pressure. Inflation had skyrocketed as a stronger-than-expected recovery from the pandemic recession overwhelmed factories, ports and freight yards, causing delays, shortages and higher prices. In response, central banks began raising interest rates to try to cool economic growth and tame spiking prices. ""We´ve all got all these different things going on,´´ said Robin Brooks, chief economist at the International Institute of Finance. ""The volatility of inflation went up. The volatility of growth went up. And therefore, it´s become infinitely harder for central banks to steer the ship.´´ China, pursuing a zero-COVID policy, imposed lockdowns that have severely weakened the world´s second-biggest economy. At the time, many developing countries still grappled with the pandemic and the heavy debts they had taken on to protect their populations from economic disaster. All those challenges might have been manageable. But when Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24, the West responded with heavy sanctions. Both actions disrupted trade in food and energy. Russia is the world´s third-biggest petroleum producer and a leading exporter of natural gas, fertilizer and wheat. Farms in Ukraine feed millions globally. The resulting inflation has rippled out to the world. Near Johannesburg, South Africa, Stephanie Muller has been comparing prices online and checking different grocery stores to find the best deals. ""I have three children who are all in school, so I have been feeling the difference,´´ she said. Shopping at a market in Vietnam's capital of Hanoi, Bui Thu Huong said she's been limiting her spending and cutting back on weekend dinners out. At least there´s one advantage to cooking at home with her children: ""We can bond with them more in the kitchen, while saving money at the same time.´´ Syahrul Yasin Limpo, Indonesia's agriculture minister, warned this month that the price of instant noodles, a staple in the Southeast Asian nation, might triple because of inflated wheat prices. In neighboring Malaysia, vegetable farmer Jimmy Tan laments that fertilizer prices are up 50%. He´s also paying more for supplies like plastic sheets, bags and hoses. In Karachi, Pakistan, far from the battlefields of Ukraine, Kamran Arif has taken a second, part-time job to supplement his wages. ""Because we have no control on prices, we can only try to increase our income,´´ he said. A vast majority of people live in poverty in Pakistan, whose currency has lost up to 30% of its value against the dollar and the government has increased electricity prices 50%. Muhammad Shakil, an importer and exporter, says he can no longer get wheat, white chickpeas and yellow peas from Ukraine. ""Now that we have to import from other countries, we have to buy at higher prices"" - sometimes 10%-15% more, Shakil said. As the war fuels inflation, central banks are raising interest rates to try to slow price increases without derailing economic growth. The resulting increase in loan rates is punishing FlooringStores, a New York company that helps customers find flooring material and contractors. Sales are down because fewer homeowners are borrowing to pay for home improvements. ""A huge percentage of our customers finance their projects with home-equity loans and similar products, meaning that the hike in interest rates really killed our business,´´ CEO Todd Saunders said. ""Inflation wasn´t helping, but the interest rates had a bigger effect.´´ Europe, which for years depended on Russian oil and natural gas for its industrial economy, has absorbed a gut punch. It faces the growing threat of recession as the Kremlin throttles back flows of natural gas used to heat homes, generate electricity and fire up factories. Prices are 15 times what they were before Russia massed troops on the Ukrainian border in March 2021. ""There´s a lot more recessionary risk and pressure in Europe than in the rest of the high-income economies,"" said Adam Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics and a former Bank of England policymaker. The damage has hardly spared Russia, whose economy the IMF expects to contract 6% this year. Sergey Aleksashenko, a Russian economist now living in the United States, noted that the country's retail sales tumbled 10% in the second quarter compared with a year earlier as consumers cut back. ""They have no money to spend,"" he said. ___ Wiseman reported from Washington.

Two military guards were injured by a ""neo-paralyzing spray"" used by the Russian while resisting arrest, it said.

When he heard the winning words ""and still,"" an emotional Usyk raised his left arm and pulled the flag over his face. Six months ago, he was patrolling the streets of Kyiv with an automatic rifle and defending Ukraine from the invading Russians. Here, inside the ring at King Abdullah Sport City arena, the still-undefeated Usyk had lived up to his billing as the sporting pride of Ukraine by beating Anthony Joshua in a closely fought rematch on Saturday to keep his WBA, WBO and IBF belts. ""I devote this victory to my country, to my family, to my team, to all the military defending this country,"" the 35-year-old Usyk said through a translator. ""Thank you very, very much."" After a grueling five-month training camp, Usyk entered the arena in a blue-and-yellow top carrying the words ""Colors of Freedom"" and supported by words of encouragement from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in his nightly video address to the nation. Ukraine's Oleksandr Usyk celebrates after beating Britain's Anthony Joshua to retain his world heavyweight title at King Abdullah Sports City in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, Sunday, Aug. 21, 2022. (AP Photo/Hassan Ammar) ""We stick together,"" the president said. ""We help each other. We restore what was destroyed. We fight for all our people. And we cheer for those who represent Ukraine, today - definitely for Usyk, our guy!"" And Usyk started as the favorite after outclassing Joshua in the first fight in London in September last year. However, the British challenger, a former two-time champion, came into the rematch with a new game plan from his new trainer Robert Garcia: Attack Usyk's body and keep the pressure on. And it nearly worked, with Usyk taken to the limit in the ninth round as he was chased around the ring by Joshua, who landed combinations and targeted Usyk's ribs. Usyk took a deep breath at the bell, then came out hard in the 10th round, hurting Joshua with an early right hook and forcing him onto the ropes for the first time in the fight. The battering of Joshua was sustained in the 11th while the 12th was evenly fought, the fight ending with both fighters - clearly exhausted - falling to their knees in front of each other on the canvas. They embraced and Joshua appeared to offer his help to the plight of Ukraine. Then, in an expletive-laden speech inside the ring after grabbing the microphone, Joshua - who moments earlier was seen picking up two of Usyk's belts and throwing them to the canvas - hit back at his critics before praising Usyk for fighting so well in the circumstances. ""I was studying Ukraine and all the champions from your amazing country,"" Joshua said. ""I´ve never been there. What´s happening there, I don´t know but it´s not nice. For Usyk to be champion, under those circumstances, please raise your hands."" Usyk was complimentary about Joshua, too. ""This is already history,"" he said. ""Many generations are going to watch this fight, especially the round when someone tried to beat me hard. But I stood up to it and turned it in a different way."" Usyk also claimed the Ring Magazine belt with the win. There´s only one heavyweight title that Usyk doesn´t own - the WBC one that is about to be vacated by Tyson Fury, who says he is retired. When asked about Fury, Usyk said: ""I am sure Tyson Fury is not retired yet. I am sure Tyson Fury wants to fight me. If I´m not fighting Tyson Fury, I´m not fighting at all."" Two judges gave it to Usyk, one 115-113 and the other 116-112. The other gave the fight to Joshua, 115-113. Joshua, a two-time heavyweight champion, fell to his third loss in 27 fights and his career is at a crossroads. Where Usyk goes from now appears to depend on Fury. Saudi state television published photographs showing Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman attending the fight. The 36-year-old son of King Salman, the crown prince has pushed for sporting events to come to the kingdom even as U.S. intelligence agencies believe he ordered the beheading and dismemberment of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi. ___ More AP boxing: https://apnews.com/hub/boxing and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports Britain's Anthony Joshua, right, speaks to the crowd after losing to Ukraine's Oleksandr Usyk in their world heavyweight title fight at King Abdullah Sports City in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, Sunday, Aug. 21, 2022.

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-11129775/Finland-Sweden-offer-NATO-edge-rivalry-warms-north.html,2022-08-20,"Finland, Sweden offer NATO an edge as rivalry warms up north","The first surprise, for the Finnish conscripts and officers taking part in a NATO-hosted military exercise in the Arctic this spring: the sudden roar of a U.S. Marine helicopter assault force, touching down in a field right next to the Finns' well-hidden command post. The second surprise: Spilling out of their field headquarters, the Finnish Signal Corps communications workers and others inside routed the U.S. Marines - the Finns' designated adversary in the NATO exercise and members of America's professional and premier expeditionary force - in the mock firefight that followed. Finnish camouflage for the Arctic snow, scrub and scree likely had kept the Americans from even realizing the command post was there when they landed, Finnish commander Lt. Col. Mikko Kuoka suspected. ""For those who years from now will doubt it,"" Kuoka, modestly stunned by the outcome of the random skirmish, wrote in an infantry-focused blog recording the outcome, of an episode he later confirmed for The Associated Press. ""That actually happened."" As the exercise made clear, NATO's addition of Finland and Sweden - what President Joe Biden calls ""our allies of the high north"" - would bring military and territorial advantages to the Western defense alliance. That's especially so as the rapid melting of the Arctic from climate change awakens strategic rivalries at the top of the world. In contrast to the NATO expansion of former Soviet states that needed big boosts in the decades after the Cold War, the alliance would be bringing in two sophisticated militaries and, in Finland's case, a country with a remarkable tradition of national defense. Both Finland and Sweden are in a region on one of Europe's front lines and meeting places with Russia. Finland, defending against Soviet Russia´s invasion on the eve of World War II, relied on fighters on snowshoes and skis, expert snow and forest camouflage, and reindeers transporting weapons. In this image provided by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, a U.S. marine waves his troops onward after using Dutch landing craft to land near Sandstrand, Norway, March 21, 2022, during the Exercise Cold Response 22. (NATO via AP) Russian President Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine in late February, along with his pointed reminder about the Kremlin's nuclear arsenal and his repeated invocation of broad territorial claims stemming from the days of the Russian Empire, have galvanized current NATO nations into strengthening their collective defenses and bringing on board new members. Finland - until 1917 a grand duchy in that empire - and Sweden abandoned longtime national policies of military nonalignment. They applied to come under NATO's nuclear and conventional umbrella and join what is now 30 other member states in a powerful mutual defense pact, stipulating that an attack on one member is an attack on all. Putin justified his invasion of West-looking Ukraine as pushing back against NATO and the West as, he said, they encroached ever closer on Russia. A NATO that includes Finland and Sweden would come as an ultimate rebuke for Putin's war, empowering the defensive alliance in a strategically important region, surrounding Russia in the Baltic Sea and Arctic Ocean, and crowding NATO up against Russia's western border for more than 800 additional miles (1,300 kilometers). ""I spent four years, my term, trying to persuade Sweden and Finland to join NATO,"" former NATO secretary-general Lord George Robertson said this summer. ""Vladimir Putin managed it in four weeks."" Biden has been part of bipartisan U.S. and international cheerleading for the two countries' candidacies. Reservations expressed by Turkey and Hungary keep NATO approval from being a lock. Russia in recent years has been ""rearming up in the north, with advanced nuclear weapons, hypersonic missiles and multiple bases,"" NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said this month. ""Russia´s threats, and Russia´s military build-up, mean that NATO is strengthening its presence in the north.' Finland and Sweden would bring a lot to that mix. But they're not without flaws. Both countries downsized their militaries, cut defense funding and closed bases after the collapse of the Soviet Union lulled Cold War-era fears. As of just five years ago, Sweden's entire tiny national defense force could fit into one of of Stockholm's soccer stadiums, a critic noted. But as Putin grew more confrontational, Sweden reinstated conscription and otherwise moved to rebuild its military. Sweden has a capable navy and a high-tech air force. Like Finland, Sweden has a valued homegrown defense industry; Sweden is one of the smallest countries in the world to build its own fighter jets. Finland's defense force, meanwhile, is the stuff of legend. In 1939 and 1940, Finland's tiny, miserably equipped forces, fighting alone in what became known as the Winter War, made the nation one of few to survive a full-on assault by the Soviet Union with independence intact. Over the course of an exceptionally, deathly cold winter, Finnish fighters, sometimes cloaked in white bedsheets for camouflage and typically moving unseen on foot, snowshoes and skis, lost some territory to Russia but forced out the invaders. Finns were responsible for up to 200,000 fatalities among invading forces versus an estimated 25,000 Finns lost, recounted Iskander Rehman, a fellow at Johns Hopkins' Henry A. Kissinger Center for Global Affairs.. It helped fuel a Finnish national credo of ""sisu,"" or grit. Finnish Winter War veterans were recruited for the U.S. Army's winter warfare training, Rehman noted. Finland's constitution makes rallying to the national defense an obligation of every citizen. Finland says it can muster a 280,000-strong fighting force, built on near-universal male conscription and a large, well-trained reserve, equipped with modern artillery, warplanes and tanks, much of it U.S. The U.S. and NATO are likely to increase their presence around the Baltic and Arctic with the accession of the two Scandinavian countries. ""Just looking at the map, if you add in Finland and Sweden, you essentially turn the entire Baltic Sea into a NATO lake,"" with just two smaller bits of Russia lining it, said Zachary Selden, a former director of the NATO Parliamentary Assembly's defense and security committee who is now a national security expert at the University of Florida. Likewise, Russia will become the only non-NATO member among countries with claims to Arctic territory, and the only non-NATO member of the Atlantic Council, an eight-member international forum created for Arctic issues. Selden predicts a greater NATO presence in the Baltics as a result, perhaps with a new NATO regional command, along with U.S. military rotations, although likely not any permanent base. Russia sees its military presence in the Arctic as vital to its European strategy, including ballistic missile submarines that give it second-strike capability in any conflict with NATO, analysts say. The Arctic is warming much faster under climate change than the Earth as a whole, opening up competition for Arctic resources and access as Arctic ice vanishes. Russia has been building its fleet of nuclear-powered icebreakers, aiming to escort expected future commercial shipping traffic through the melting Arctic, ""as a way to create this toll road for transit,' said Sherri Goodman, a former U.S. first deputy undersecretary of defense, now at the Wilson Center´s Polar Institute and at the Center for Climate & Security. Goodman points to future threats NATO will need to be able to deal with as the melting Arctic opens up, such as the kind of shadowy, unofficial forces Russia has used in Crimea and in Africa and elsewhere, and the increased risk of a hard-to-handle Russian nuclear maritime accident. NATO strategy increasingly will incorporate the strategic advantage Finland and Sweden would bring to such scenarios, analysts said. Kuoka´s U.S. counterpart in NATO's Arctic exercise this spring, Marine Lt. Col. Ryan Gordinier wrote in an email provided through Marine spokespeople that he and his Marines were ""impressed"" by the Finnish infantry´s ability to reach otherwise unreachable positions by foot, snowshoe and ski, and to move undetected over snow. It ""made us pause"" - and likely would any real adversary as well, Gordinier wrote. ___ Associated Press writers Lolita C.

It was the second drone incident at the headquarters in three weeks and followed explosions at a Russian airfield and ammunition depot on the peninsula this month. Oleg Kryuchkov, an aide to Crimea´s governor, also said Saturday that ""attacks by small drones"" triggered air-defense systems in western Crimea. ""Air defense systems successfully hit all targets over the territory over Crimea on Saturday morning. There are no casualties or material damage,"" his boss, Sergei Aksyonov, said on Telegram. Sevastopol governor Mikhail Razvozhaev said on Telegram that the city's air-defense systems were called into action again late Saturday. The incidents underlined Russian forces´ vulnerability in Crimea. A drone attack on Russia's Black Sea naval headquarters on July 31 injured five people and forced the cancellation of observances of Russia´s Navy Day. This week, a Russian ammunition depot in Crimea was hit by an explosion. Last week, nine Russian warplanes were reported destroyed at an airbase on Crimea.

(AP Photo/David Goldman) Ukrainian authorities have stopped short of publicly claiming responsibility. But President Volodymyr Zelenskyy alluded to Ukrainian attacks behind enemy lines after the blasts in Crimea. Meanwhile, fighting in southern Ukrainian areas just north of Crimea has stepped up in recent weeks as Ukrainian forces try to drive Russian forces out of cities they have occupied since early in the six-month-old war. A Russian missile attack wounded 12 people, including three children, and damaged houses and an apartment block Saturday in the town of Voznesensk in the Mykolaiv region, the Ukrainian prosecutor's office said. Two of the children were in serious condition and the governor said one had lost an eye. A Ukrainian airstrike, meanwhile, hit targets in Melitopol, the largest Russian-controlled city in the Zaporizhzhia region, 100 kilometers (65 miles) north of Crimea, according to Ukrainian and Russia-installed local officials. The Ukrainian military on Saturday said it had destroyed a prized Russian radar system and other equipment stationed in occupied areas in the southern Zaporizhzhia region. It was not clear if this was the strike on Melitopol. ""Tonight, there were powerful explosions in Melitopol, which the whole city heard,"" the Ukrainian mayor of Melitopol, Ivan Ferodov, said. ""According to preliminary data, (it was) a precise hit on one of the Russian military bases, which the Russian fascists are trying to restore for the umpteenth time in the airfield area."" In the east, Ukraine´s military General Staff said Saturday that intensified combat took place around Bakhmut, a small city whose capture would enable Russia to threaten the two largest remaining Ukrainian-held cities in the eastern Donbas region. Bakhmut for weeks has been a key target of Moscow´s eastern offensive as the Russian military tries to complete a months-long campaign to conquer all of the Donbas, where pro-Moscow separatists have proclaimed two republics that Russia recognized as sovereign states at the beginning of the war. A local Ukrainian official reported sustained fighting Saturday near four settlements on the border of Luhansk and Donetsk provinces, which together make up the contested Donbas region. Luhansk Gov. Serhii Haidai did not name the settlements. Russian forces overran nearly all of Luhansk last month and since then have focused on capturing Ukrainian-held areas of Donetsk. Russian shelling killed seven civilians Friday in Donetsk province, including four in Bakhmut, Gov. Pavlo Kyrylenko wrote Saturday on Telegram. Taking Bakhmut would give the Russians room to advance on the province´s main Ukrainian-held cities, Kramatorsk and Sloviansk. Ukraine said Sloviansk and Kramatorsk were targeted Friday, along with the Kharkiv region to the north, home to Ukraine´s second-largest city. Local authorities reported renewed Russian shelling overnight along a broad front, including the northern Kharkiv and Sumy regions, which border Russia, as well as of the eastern Dnipropetrovsk region and Mykolaiv. In other developments Saturday: __ Pedestrians in downtown Kyiv took pictures of a large column of burned-out and captured Russian tanks and infantry carriers that was put on display on a central boulevard in the Ukrainian capital. The display comes just days ahead of Ukraine´s independence day on Aug., which also coincides with six months since the Russian invasion. __The Joint Coordination Center in Istanbul on Saturday authorized the movement of four outbound vessels carrying 33,300 metric tons of food from Ukraine under the Black Sea Grain deal. The ships will leave Ukrainian ports on Sunday. The agency will conduct 10 more ship inspections on Sunday. The deal seeks to get tons of grain exports stuck in Ukraine by the war safely out across the Black Sea. __ The Interior Ministry for the separatist Donetsk People's Republic said an improvised bomb exploded near the zoo in Mariupol, which the city's mayor was to visit, but the mayor was not injured.

Greg Abbott, R-Texas, often knocks President Joe Biden for high inflation and a looming recession - a standard GOP argument going into the November elections. But inflation is even worse in major Texas cities than across the nation as a whole. Government figures show inflation is 10.2% in the Houston area and 9.4% around Dallas, higher than the latest national average of 8.5%. Abbott and other GOP leaders are making a paradoxical argument that the U.S. economy has slumped into a recession, but Republican-led parts of the country are still booming. Those officials are blaming Biden's policies for sky-high gasoline and food prices, while taking credit for the job gains those same policies helped spur. The Texas governor tweeted on July 28: ""The U.S. economy is in a recession under Biden. Meanwhile, Texas was #1 in the nation for job growth in June & more Texans have jobs today than ever before in our state´s history."" The Associated Press found a familiar pattern in 15 Republican-led states in which governors on Twitter would praise job growth in their states, while senators would simultaneously say the national economy as a whole was crashing. These seemingly conflicting claims were also repeated in public remarks. GOP leaders say state policies such as low tax rates and keeping business open during the pandemic helped to fuel hiring and investment. But their claims tend to ignore how job growth was also boosted by a historic injection of federal money that began in March 2020 and continued under Biden with last year's $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package.

Government figures show inflation is 10.2% in the Houston area and 9.4% around Dallas, higher than the latest national average of 8.5%. (AP Photo/LM Otero, File) Biden and his fellow Democrats have acknowledged the pain caused by inflation that hit a 40-year high this summer. But the president has stressed that the United States has avoided a recession because of the low 3.5% unemployment rate. He argues that global factors such as the pandemic, fragile supply chains and Russia´s invasion of Ukraine caused prices to jump - and that he´s meeting the public´s needs with the economic and climate package signed into law on Tuesday. ""Too often we hand the biggest microphone to the critics and the cynics who delight in declaring failure while those committed to making real progress do the hard work of governing,"" Biden said in a swipe at the GOP. Multiple surveys do show that voters have a sense of foreboding about the economy and that most people fault the president. Researchers said there's not a lot of academic analyses to show why many voters seem willing to blame inflation on White House policies and give a pass to statehouses, as inflation had been low in recent decades and less of a factor in elections than jobs. Andrew Reeves, a political science professor at Washington University in St. Louis, said most voters likely judge the local and national economies by different standards. When it comes to state and local officials, voters form opinions through what they observe in their daily lives. But they often gauge the national economy through hard numbers and political ideologies. ""The `national economy´ is this nebulous thing that none of us actually experiences,"" Reeves said. ""It´s an abstract concept. We may be more willing to let our partisanship shade how we see what is going on nationally. Joe Biden is well into his term, so the honeymoon is over and he owns this economy - whether his policies are directly responsible for it or not."" Republican governors such as Florida's Ron DeSantis and Georgia's Brian Kemp are largely unscathed on inflation, even though consumer prices are significantly above the national average in both of those states. Inflation is 10.6% in the Miami area, 11.2% in Tampa and 11.5% in Atlanta. What many voters in Republican states are hearing is an economic argument similar to what Biden has attempted on a national scale - that job growth and government finances are strong enough to insulate people from a downturn. DeSantis dismissed Biden´s claims that the U.S. economy remains healthy, calling that ""Orwellian doublespeak."" The governor said at Florida´s Airports Council conference on Aug. 1 that his state´s budget surplus could insulate it from a downturn. ""We're not immune to the inflation, we're not immune to the energy prices,"" DeSantis said. ""Because Florida has been open, because Florida has excelled economically, we're in the position where we're going to be able to meet those needs of the state regardless of what Uncle Joe throws at us from Washington, D.C."" Job growth has been broad across the country. Data released Friday by the Bureau of Statistic s found that employment increased in 43 states and was essentially unchanged in seven states over the past 12 months. But the bipartisan research group EIG analyzed job growth in the three major Republican states (Texas, Arizona and Florida) and the three major Democratic ones (California, Illinois and New York). It found that the GOP areas have fully recovered and exceeded their pandemic job totals, while the recovery has been slower in Democratic states. What seems to be the much more overarching priority among voters is not jobs but inflation, said John Lettieri, EIG's president and CEO. At a time of political polarization, it´s striking to him how fears about prices are crossing generational, class, regional and partisan lines. ""There is strong unanimity that the economy is an issue, inflation is the No. 1 problem and Biden is to blame,"" Lettieri said. ""This cuts across all the divides. All those different ways we slice up the electorate, they´re all responding to this to one degree or another in strong ways."" Inflation appears to be an inescapable challenge for Biden, even as other issues such as abortion rights appear to be rallying Democratic voters. Republicans are able promote job gains to say why they would be better at leading the economy, without having to list, as Biden has stressed in speeches, their own policies for reducing consumer prices. Gabriel Lenz, a political science professor at the University of California Los Angeles, said the ""best measure of what voters are personally experiencing"" is a metric known as real disposable personal income. That figure looks at how much money people have after adjusting for taxes and inflation. Its changes over the past two years mirror those of Democratic political fortunes. When Biden signed pandemic relief into law in March 2021, people's real disposable income climbed 28.7% from a year ago. The aid helped the economy recover while some notable economists warned it could also be inflationary. As prices rose over the past year and much of the aid expired, real disposable income has tumbled 3.5% over the past 12 months as a result. Based on that number, Lenz concluded: ""It's no surprise that people are gloomy."" ___ Follow AP for full coverage of the midterms at https://apnews.com/hub/2022-midterm-elections and on Twitter, https://twitter.com/ap_politics FILE - Florida Gov.

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-11129557/UN-US-buying-big-Ukraine-grain-shipment-hungry-regions.html,2022-08-20,UN: US buying big Ukraine grain shipment for hungry regions,"The United States is stepping up to buy about 150,000 metric tons of grain from Ukraine in the next few weeks for an upcoming shipment of food aid from ports no longer blockaded by war, the World Food Program chief has told The Associated Press. The final destinations for the grain are not confirmed and discussions continue, David Beasley said. But the planned shipment, one of several the U.N. agency that fights hunger is pursuing, is more than six times the amount of grain that the first WFP-arranged ship from Ukraine is now carrying toward people in the Horn of Africa at risk of starvation. Beasley spoke Friday from northern Kenya, which is deep in a drought that is withering the Horn of Africa region. He sat under a thorn tree among local women who told the AP that the last time it rained was in 2019. Their bone-dry communities face yet another failed rainy season within weeks that could tip parts of the region, especially neighboring Somalia, into famine. Already, thousands of people have died. The World Food Program says 22 million people are hungry. ""I think there´s a high probability we´ll have a declaration of famine"" in the coming weeks, Beasley said. He called the situation facing the Horn of Africa a ""perfect storm on top of a perfect storm, a tsunami on top of a tsunami"" as the drought-prone region struggles to cope amid high food and fuel prices driven partly by the war in Ukraine. World Food Program chief David Beasley meets with villagers in the village of Wagalla in northern Kenya Friday, Aug. 19, 2022. The United States is stepping up to buy about 150,000 metric tons of grain from Ukraine in the next few weeks for an upcoming shipment of food aid from ports no longer blockaded by war, the World Food Program chief has told The Associated Press. (AP Photo/Brian Inganga) The keenly awaited first aid ship from Ukraine is carrying 23,000 metric tons of grain, enough to feed 1.5 million people on full rations for a month, Beasley said. It is expected to dock in Djibouti on Aug. 26 or 27, and the wheat is supposed to be shipped overland to northern Ethiopia, where millions of people in the Tigray, Afar and Amhara regions have faced not only drought but deadly conflict. Ukraine was the source of half the grain that WFP bought last year to feed 130 million hungry people. Russia and Ukraine signed agreements with the U.N. and the Turkish government last month to enable exports of Ukrainian grain for the first time since Russia´s invasion in February. But the slow reopening of Ukraine's ports and the cautious movement of cargo ships across the mined Black Sea won't solve the global food security crisis, Beasley said. He warned that richer countries must do much more to keep grain and other assistance flowing to the hungriest parts of the world, and he named names. ""With oil profits being so high right now - record-breaking profits, billions of dollars every week - ... the Gulf states need to help, need to step up and do it now,"" Beasley said. ""It´s inexcusable not to. Particularly since these are their neighbors, these are their brothers, their family."" He asserted the World Food Program could save ""millions of lives"" with just one day of Gulf countries´ oil profits. China needs to help as well, Beasley said. ""China´s the second-largest economy in the world, and we get diddly-squat from China,"" or very little, he added. Despite grain leaving Ukraine and hopes rising of global markets beginning to stabilize, the world´s most vulnerable people face a long, difficult recovery, the WFP chief said. ""Even if this drought ends, we´re talking about a global food crisis at least for another 12 months,"" Beasley said. ""But in terms of the poorest of the poor, it´s gonna take several years to come out of this."" Some of the world's poorest people without enough food are in northern Kenya, where animal carcasses are slowly stripped to the bone beneath an ungenerous sky. Millions of livestock, the source of families´ wealth and nutrition, have died in the drought. Many water pumps have gone dry. More and more thousands of children are malnourished. ""Don´t forget us,"" resident Hasan Mohamud told Beasley. ""Even the camels have disappeared. Even the donkeys have succumbed."" With so many in need, aid that does arrive can disappear like a raindrop in the sand. Local women who qualified for WFP cash handouts described taking the 6,500 shillings (about $54) and sharing it among their neighbors - in one case, 10 households. ""The most interesting thing we hear is people saying, `We´re not the only ones,´"" WFP program officer Felix Okech told the AP. ""'We´re the ones who have been selected (for handouts), but there are many more like us.' So that is very humbling to hear."" In a small crowd that had gathered to listen to stories of children too weak to stand and milk gone dry, one woman at the edge of the woven plastic mat spoke up. Sahara Abdilleh, 50, said she makes perhaps 1,000 shillings ($8.30) a week from gathering firewood, scouring a landscape that gives less and less back every day. Like Beasley, she was thinking globally. ""Is there any country, like Afghanistan or Ukraine, that is worse off than us?"" she asked. ___ Follow all AP stories about drought at https://apnews.com/hub/climate-and-environment. ___ Follow all AP stories about the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine.

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-11129491/Finland-asks-Can-prime-minister-party-like-rock-star.html,2022-08-20,Finland asks: Does a prime minister have a right to party?,"In a leaked video, Finland´s Prime Minister Sanna Marin is seen dancing and singing with friends at a private party. The 36-year-old leader poses for the camera. She sits on her knees, hands behind her head. She´s entangled in a group hug. She´s having a good time. Countless similar videos are shared daily on social media by young and not-so-young people partying in Finland and all over the world. But the leak has triggered a debate among Finns about what level of reveling is appropriate for a prime minister, especially considering neighboring Russia´s attack on Ukraine, which prompted long-neutral Finland and Sweden to apply for NATO membership. Marin, who leads the center-left Social Democratic Party, has faced a barrage of questions about the party: Were there drugs? Alcohol? Was she working or on summer vacation? Was the prime minister sober enough to handle an emergency had one arisen? The video, clearly shot by someone at the party, was leaked on social media and caught the attention of Finnish media this week. Marin said she attended the party in recent weeks, but refused to say exactly where and when. She also acknowledged that she and her friends celebrated in a ""boisterous way"" and that alcohol - but, to her knowledge, no drugs - was involved. She said Friday that she took a drug test to put an end to speculation about illegal substances. ""I hope that in the year 2022 it´s accepted that even decision-makers dance, sing and go to parties,"" Marin told reporters. ""I didn´t wish for any images to be spread, but it´s up to the voters to decide what they think about it."" Prime minister of Finland Sanna Marin holds a press conference in Helsinki, Finland, Aug. 19, 2022. Marin, who in December 2019 became Finland's youngest prime minister ever, said Friday she has taken a drug test ""for her own legal protection"" after a video was leaked of her at her private party dancing and mimicking singing. (Roni Rekomaa/Lehtikuva via AP) The prime minister, who is married and has a 4-year-old daughter, has often insisted that even though she´s the head of Finland´s government, she´s just like anyone else her age who likes a good time with friends and family in their leisure time. In Helsinki on Friday afternoon, opinions were split. Josua Fagerholm, who works in marketing, said the episode was potentially damaging to Finland´s reputation and to the public´s confidence in Finnish politicians. ""I think it´s important for our politicians to be respectable and enjoy the trust of the public. So I don´t think it´s a good look,"" he said. Mintuu Kylliainen, a student in Helsinki, disagreed. She said everyone was entitled to their opinion, but she felt the leaked video was getting too much attention. ""It´s normal to, like, party,"" Kylliainen said. ""She should have fun, too, in her life."" Some supporters say the criticism against the prime minister smacks of sexism. Marin became Finland's youngest prime minister in 2019 at age 34. Even in the egalitarian Nordic country, Marin felt her gender and age sometimes received too much emphasis. She told Vogue magazine in 2020 that ""in every position I´ve ever been in, my gender has always been the starting point - that I am a young woman."" Anu Koivonen, a professor of gender studies at Finland's University of Turku, said she didn´t think gender was a decisive factor in the uproar over the leaked video. She said the partying itself was not a big issue, but the fact the video leaked could be viewed as a judgment lapse by the prime minister in terms of the people she surrounded herself with. ""That she didn´t restrain herself in a company where she cannot trust everyone in the room,"" Koivonen said. ""I think that´s the main issue."" Jarno Limnell, a cybersecurity expert and politician for Finland´s conservative National Coalition Party, said the partying incident was problematic from a security standpoint, noting that Finland´s top leaders are of interest to foreign security services. ""Information is gathered from a variety of sources, and even seemingly trivial pieces of information can be significant to a foreign power,"" Limnell told Finnish newspaper Helsingin Sanomat. ""Top decision-makers are under close watch during the NATO ratification process."" It´s not the first time that Marin´s partying has made headlines. In December, she apologized after going out clubbing until 4 a.m. and missing a text message advising her to avoid social contacts due to her proximity to someone infected with COVID-19. Marin said she didn´t see the message because she had left her phone at home. She tested negative for the virus. Even in a progressive society like Finland's, Marin breaks the mold of a typical politician. She grew up with a single mother who was in a relationship with another woman.

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-11129263/IMF-fees-war-torn-countries-closer-elimination.html,2022-08-20,IMF fees on war-torn countries closer to elimination,"The International Monetary Fund is facing pressure to reevaluate how it imposes fees on loans it disperses to needy countries like war-torn Ukraine - which is one of the fund´s biggest borrowers. The move comes as more countries will need to turn to the IMF, as food prices and inflation internationally continues to rise. Surcharges are added fees on loans imposed on countries that are heavily indebted to the IMF. Treasury Deputy Secretary Wally Adeyemo said in Aspen last month that finance ministers of several countries realize they have to pay a price for Russia´s war in Ukraine, especially with food prices going up. ""They´re going to have to go to the IMF, they´re going to need to find assistance,"" Adeyemo said. However, the IMF fee system could change through U.S legislation. An amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act, otherwise known as the defense spending bill, would suspend IMF surcharges while their effectiveness and burden on indebted countries is studied.

(AP Photo/Andrew Harnik) That was passed by the U.S. House in July. The Senate is expected to vote on its defense bill in September. A representative of the Senate Armed Services Committee said an amendment may be offered in the next few weeks or even on the Senate floor. As the largest IMF shareholder and member of the Fund´s executive board, the U.S. can push for policy decisions and unilaterally veto some board decisions. Citing worsening financial crises in Sri Lanka and Pakistan as examples, some accuse China of engaging in debt trap diplomacy - or having countries falls so deeply in debt to that they are beholden to it on international issues. Advocates and civil rights organizations lodge the same complaint against the Fund, who claim the organization undercuts its core lender-of-last-resort role with countries in vulnerable positions to pay back debt. With an ever-worsening risk of a global debt crisis and rising interest rates, the issue has become more pressing for countries looking to reduce their deficits. However, some economists and representatives of the fund say the surcharges amount to responsible lending behavior, as they provide an incentive for members with large outstanding balances to repay their loans promptly. This applies especially for countries that may otherwise may not be able to obtain financing from private lenders. Maurice Obstfeld, a Berkeley economics professor and former IMF research department director said as a lender of last resort, the Fund's ability to lend is important as low and middle income countries face rising interest rates. ""The Fund´s staff is small and in a crisis, its efforts are better deployed serving member countries´ needs,"" he said in an email to The Associated Press. ""Surcharges could be relaxed temporarily in the face of intense pressures on borrowing countries, but at the expense of the Fund´s ability to serve its membership in the longer term."" Illinois Congressman Jesús ""Chuy"" García, who offered the defense spending amendment, told The Associated Press ""it is unfair for the IMF to require countries like Ukraine that are already deep in debt to pay surcharge fees. These surcharges increase poverty and hold back our global economic recovery."" Ukraine´s projected real GDP is expected to decline by 35 percent, due in large part to Russia´s invasion of Ukraine, according to IMF data. The country, engaged in a war with no projected end, has an outstanding balance of 7.5 billion SDRs - an IMF accounting unit valued at around $9.8 billion according to Ukrainian central bankers. The latest figures estimate that Ukraine will owe the IMF $360 million in surcharges between 2021 and 2023. Economists Joseph Stiglitz at Columbia University and Kevin P. Gallagher at Boston University wrote earlier this year that ""forcing excessive repayments lowers the productive potential of the borrowing country, but also harms creditors"" and requires borrowers ""to pay more at exactly the moment when they are most squeezed from market access in any other form."" Serhiy Nikolaychuk, Deputy Chairman of the National Bank of Ukraine, said Ukraine is continuing to pay its debts ""despite Russia´s full-scale war against Ukraine."" ""Our country will pay its debt and surcharges under previous programs and fulfill its obligations to the IMF,"" Nikolaychuk said. ""It will be difficult, but we will pay."" For years, lawmakers, economists and civil rights organizations have called on the IMF, which has for decades loaned billions to low-income countries, to end its surcharge policy. In January, 18 left-leaning lawmakers wrote to Treasury calling for the surcharge policy to be eliminated. And in April, a group of 150 civil society groups and individuals signed an open letter to the IMF, asking for the same, calling surcharges ""regressive."" A spokesperson for the fund says the surcharges are designed to discourage large and prolonged use of IMF resources. ""They only apply to countries with particularly large outstanding loans,"" Mayada Ghazala said in an emailed statement, adding that poorest countries are exempt from the surcharges. The fund´s executive board met in December 2021 and discussed the role of surcharges -it ultimately decided not to make a change to the fees, but said they would review them again in the future. The IMF was created in 1944 at the United Nations Bretton Woods Conference - one of its missions is lending to maintain the financial stability of countries. Among its 190 countries, it lends around $1 trillion, according to the organization´s website. An April review of the fund´s financial health for fiscal year 2022 and 2023 states that lending income excluding surcharges ""remain strong and are expected to exceed expenses in FY 2023-2024."" Andrés Arauz, a senior research fellow at the liberal Center for Economic and Policy Research says the IMF´s financial position shows ""the surcharges are not necessary for sound finances."" ""There is no excuse for the IMF to be punishing countries under debt stress with surcharges,"" he said. ""There is also no logic to it, the amount of money that the IMF raises from surcharges is trivial relative to its income and capacity."" Garcia said ""I´m proud the House passed my amendment to support a pause and review of surcharges at the IMF, and I will keep up the fight until the President signs it into law."" Separately, the U.S. has sent roughly $7.3 billion in aid to Ukraine since the war began in late February, including a new $775 million defense aid package announced Friday.

Lawmakers voted 50-1 to oust the government of Prime Minister Dritan Abazovic just weeks after he signed an agreement regulating the position of the Serbian church in Montenegro. The issue is sensitive for many in the small Balkan nation of 620,000 people that split from its much bigger neighbor Serbia in 2006. The Serbian Orthodox Church enjoys the biggest following in Montenegro, but the nation is divided over the church's dominant role and the country's ties to Serbia. Critics have argued there was no need for a special deal with the Serbian church separate from other religious communities. Pro-Western groups in Montenegro also have described the agreement as a tool for Serbia and Russia to increase their influence in Montenegro amid the war in Ukraine. Abazovic has defended the agreement as the way to put behind the long-standing church dispute over its property and other rights in Montenegro, and focus on other important issues. It was not immediately clear whether the fall of the government would lead to snap parliamentary elections or if the parties would try to form a new govening coalition. Political bickering in Montenegro has blocked progress toward integration into the European Union. Montenegro in 2017 defied its former ally Russia to become a member of NATO."

The latest shutdown will come a month after Gazprom restored natural gas supply through the pipeline to only a fifth of its capacity after a previous shutoff for maintenance. Russia has blamed the reductions through the pipeline on technical problems but Germany has called the shutoffs a political move by the Kremlin to sow uncertainty and push up prices amid the conflict in Ukraine. Natural gas prices rose on Friday after the announcement, and are now more than twice as high as a year ago. In a statement posted online, Gazprom said the planned shutdown from Aug. 31 to Sept. 2 is for ""routine maintenance"" at a key compressor station along the Nord Stream 1 pipeline, which links western Russia and Germany. Natural gas prices have surged as Russia has reduced or cut off natural gas flows to a dozen European Union countries, fueling inflation and raising the risk that Europe could plunge into recession.

""We are monitoring the situation in close cooperation with the Federal Network Agency"" that regulates gas markets, the ministry said.

The newly announced maintenance shutoff raises additional fears that Russia could completely cut off the gas to try to gain political leverage over Europe as it tries to boost its storage levels for winter. Germany recently announced that its gas storage facilities had reached 75% capacity, two weeks before the target date of Sept. 1. Germans have been urged to cut gas use now so the country will have enough for the winter ahead. Gazprom said once the work is completed, the flow of gas through Nord Stream 1 will resume at its prior level of 33 million cubic meters, or just 20% of the pipeline´s capacity.

The official said the U.S. is looking to help shape and arm the Ukrainian force of the future as the war drags on. ""These capabilities are carefully calibrated to make the most difference on the battlefield and strengthen Ukraine´s position at the negotiating table,"" Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a statement.

(AP Photo/Efrem Lukatsky, File) The defense official briefed reporters on the new weapons aid on condition of anonymity under ground rules set by the Defense Department. For much of the last four months of the war, Russia has concentrated on capturing the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine, where pro-Moscow separatists have controlled some territory as self-proclaimed republics for eight years. Russian forces have made some incremental gains in the east, but they have also been put on the defensive in other regions, as Ukraine ratchets up its attacks in Ukraine´s Black Sea peninsula of Crimea. The Russian-occupied territory was seized by Moscow in 2014. Nine Russian warplanes were reported destroyed last week at an airbase on Crimea in strikes that highlighted the Ukrainians´ capacity to strike deep behind enemy lines. Russian leaders have warned that striking facilities in Crimea marks an escalation in the conflict fueled by the U.S. and NATO allies and threatens to pull America deeper into the war. One Western official said Friday that the war is at a ""near operational standstill,"" with neither side able to launch major offensives. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss military assessments, said the whole tempo of the campaign has slowed, partly because both sides recognize that ""this is a marathon not a sprint and that expenditure rates and conserving their munitions is important."" But the U.S. and Western officials both said that Ukraine has been able to launch successful attacks deep behind Russian battle lines, which is eroding logistics support and command and control of Moscow's forces, and harming their morale. The U.S. official said that while Ukrainian troops haven't been able to retake a lot of territory, they have been able to significantly weaken Russian positions in a number of places. Efforts to tamp down the fighting have also continued. On Thursday, Turkey´s leader and the U.N. chief met in western Ukraine with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. They discussed a range of issues including prisoner exchanges and an effort to get U.N. atomic energy experts to visit the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine. The facility has been controlled by Russian forces since shortly after the invasion began on Feb. 24 and has been the target of a number of explosions. Kyiv and Moscow accuse each other of shelling the plant, stoking international fears of a catastrophe on the continent.

In a letter sent to government officials, the National Health Service Confederation said surging costs mean many people will have to choose between skipping meals to heat their homes or living in cold and damp conditions this winter. The group's chief executive Matthew Taylor said health leaders took the step to make an ""unprecedented intervention"" and write to the government because the U.K. was ""facing a humanitarian crisis"" due to the public health risks linked to rising fuel costs. The average U.K. household fuel bill has risen more than 50% so far in 2022 as Russia´s war in Ukraine squeezes global oil and natural gas supplies. A further increase is due in October, when the average bill is forecast to hit 3,500 pounds ($4,300) a year. Official figures this week showed that U.K. inflation hit a new 40-year high of 10.1% in July. Taylor said inability to heat homes and afford food will ""lead to outbreaks of illness and sickness around the country and widen health inequalities, worsen children´s life chances, and leave an indelible scar on local communities."" He warned that this will compound pressure on hospitals and public health services, which are already under stress and are bracing for a difficult winter. ""Health leaders are clear that, unless urgent action is taken by the government, this will cause a public health emergency,"" he said. The government has faced widespread calls to freeze bills or help people with their finances, but ministers have said no action will be taken until the Conservative Party selects a new prime minister to replace Boris Johnson. The winner of the Conservative leadership contest will be announced on Sept. 5. Authorities say they have set aside billions of pounds to support people in need with state subsidies. Most households will also receive 400 pounds ($474) over the winter to help with energy bills. The NHS Confederation said this is not enough and more needs to be done to help those who cannot cope with energy bills rising by some 80%."
https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-11126849/2-Russian-villages-evacuated-fire-munitions-depot.html,2022-08-19,"Russia, Ukraine spar over fighting near nuclear facility","A fire at a munitions depot inside Russia forced the evacuation of two villages near the border with Ukraine, an official said Friday, while two civilians were reported wounded by Russian shelling near the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant as both sides traded accusations about fighting near the facility in southern Ukraine. The fire late Thursday struck the munitions storage building near the village of Timonovo in Russia´s Belgorod region on Ukraine´s northeastern border. About 1,100 people live in Timonovo and Soloti, about 15 miles (25 kilometers) from the border. No one was hurt, said Belgorod regional Gov. Vyacheslav Gladkov. The fire came days after another ammunition depot exploded on the Crimean Peninsula, a Russian-occupied territory on the Black Sea that was annexed by Moscow in 2014. Last week, nine Russian warplanes were reported destroyed at an airbase on Crimea, demonstrating both the Russians´ vulnerability and the Ukrainians´ capacity to strike deep behind enemy lines. Ukrainian authorities have stopped short of publicly claiming responsibility. But President Volodymyr Zelenskyy alluded to Ukrainian attacks behind enemy lines after the blasts in Crimea, which Russia has blamed on ""sabotage."" Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said in televised remarks Friday that statements from Ukrainian officials about striking facilities in Crimea mark ""an escalation of the conflict openly encouraged by the United States and its NATO allies."" This satellite image provided by Maxar Technologies shows the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in Russian occupied Ukraine, Friday, Aug. 19, 2022. Kyiv and Moscow continued to accuse each other of shelling Europe's largest nuclear power plant, stoking international fears of a catastrophe on the continent. (Satellite image ©2022 Maxar Technologies via AP) Ryabkov said Russian officials had warned the U.S. against such actions in phone calls with high-level members of the Biden administration, adding that ""deep and open U.S. involvement"" in the war in Ukraine ""effectively puts the U.S. on the brink of becoming a party to the conflict."" In spite of the latest incidents, a Western official said the war is at a ""near operational standstill,"" with neither side able to launch major offensives. ""The whole tempo of the campaign has slowed down, partly because both sides have become more conscious that this is a marathon not a sprint and that expenditure rates and conserving their munitions is important,"" said official said who spoke on condition of anonymity because he´s not authorized to discuss intelligence matters publicly. Later Friday, a Ukrainian official said two civilians were wounded by Russian shelling of Ukrainian communities neighboring the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, the latest in a long string of such shelling accusations over the past weeks. ""A new enemy attack on the Nikopol district. Five shells fired by Russian cannon artillery flew into the residential areas of Marhanets,"" Valentyn Reznichenko, the regional governor, said on Telegram. Both Nikopol and Marhanets are Ukrainian-controlled towns which face the nuclear plant across the Dnieper River. ""According to preliminary reports, two people have been wounded: an 18-year-old girl and a 40-year-old man. Both are in hospital,"" Reznichenko added. Kyiv and Moscow continued to accuse each other for the shelling near Europe´s largest nuclear power plant. A senior official at the Ukrainian presidential office told reporters ""the threat of an environmental catastrophe on a global scale"" remains due to the ""periodic shelling"" of the plant by the Russian army. Kyrylo Tymoshenko, deputy head of the presidential office, said at the same briefing that Russian shelling had destroyed ""more than 3,700 infrastructure objects"" in the vicinity of the plant, including heating, electricity, gas and water supply facilities. Zelenskyy also stressed the situation around the Zaporizhzhia plant in his Friday evening address. ""If Russia´s radiation blackmail continues, this summer may go down in the history of various European countries as one of the most tragic of all time. Because not a single instruction at any nuclear power plant in the world provides a procedure in case a terrorist state turns a nuclear power plant into a target,"" he said. Meanwhile, the Kremlin said that Russian President Vladimir Putin told French counterpart Emmanuel Macron in their first phone conversation since May 28 that Ukrainian shelling around the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant ""raised the threat of a large-scale catastrophe that could lead to radioactive contamination of large territories."" The Zaporizhzhia nuclear facility in Ukraine's south has been controlled by Russian forces since shortly after the invasion began on Feb. 24. Ukraine has accused Russia of storing troops and weapons at the plant and using its grounds to launch strikes against Ukrainian-controlled territory. Ukrainian officials and military analysts say Moscow´s forces have cynically employed the plant as a shield, knowing that the Ukrainians would be hesitant to fire back. Russia has denied the accusations and, in turn, accused Ukrainian forces of repeatedly shelling the plant. The French presidency said in a statement that Macron ""underlined his concerns"" regarding the situation at the Zaporizhzhia plant and expressed his support for the deployment of a International Atomic Energy Agency mission to the site ""as soon as possible."" Putin agreed to the mission's deployment under the discussed terms, according to the French statement. The Kremlin said that ""the Russian side reaffirmed its readiness to offer the necessary assistance to the agency´s experts."" Yevgeny Balitsky, the Moscow-backed chief of temporary administration for the Russia-controlled part of the Zaporizhzhia region, said Friday that an IAEA mission could approach the plant from Ukrainian-held territory, a shift in Moscow´s position which previously had suggested that the mission should travel to the plant from Crimea. ""I believe they may also come from the side of Ukraine,"" Balitsky said in televised remarks. ""We can safely bring them to the plant and show where the fire is coming from and who is shooting."" Mikhail Ulyanov, the Russian envoy to international organizations in Vienna where the IAEA is based, said he believes a visit by the agency could realistically take place in early September. IN OTHER DEVELOPMENTS: - The state-owned energy company Gazprom announced that a key Russian natural gas pipeline will shut down for three days of maintenance at the end of this month, raising economic pressure on Germany and other European countries that depend on the fuel to power industry, generate electricity and heat homes. The latest shutdown will come a month after Gazprom restored natural gas supply through the pipeline to only a fifth of its capacity after a previous shutoff for maintenance. Russia has blamed the reductions through the pipeline on technical problems but Germany has called the shutoffs a political move by the Kremlin to sow uncertainty and push up prices amid the conflict in Ukraine. - U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres visited a port in the coastal Ukrainian city of Odesa, where he praised ongoing efforts to maintain a shipping corridor on the Black Sea allowing for the export of vital Ukrainian grain shipments. Guterres said that 25 ships have departed from Odesa and other Ukrainian ports since Russia and Ukraine signed a four-month grain export deal in July. Those ships have carried over 600,000 tons of grain and other food supplies like wheat, corn, sunflower oil and soy beans, Guterres said. __ Responding to a report that Russia is planning to divert the electricity from the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant to the Russian grid, the U.N. chief said the U.N. supports demilitarizing the plant, saying if this is done the problem will be solved. ""And obviously, the electricity from Zaporizhzhia is Ukrainian electricity, and it´s necessary, especially during the winter for the Ukrainian people, and this principle must be fully respected,"" Guterres said. - At least five people were killed and 10 others wounded by the Russian shelling of towns and villages in Ukraine's eastern Donetsk region, according to regional authorities. Russian shelling of the city of Kharkiv also killed at least one civilian early Friday. Russian missiles again struck port facilities and a university building in the southern port city of Mykolaiv. __ The Ukrainian military said it had thwarted over a dozen Russian attempts to advance in the eastern Donetsk region, at the forefront of Moscow´s offensive. In its regular social media update, the General Staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces also reported that Russia continued to shell towns and villages across Ukraine´s south and east. ___ The Russian-installed governor of Crimea´s largest city said that a drone had been shot down there. ""The air defense system is functioning in Sevastopol,"" Mikhail Razvozhayev said on Telegram. ""According to preliminary data, UAVs. The targets were shot down,"" he said. On Thursday, Razvozhayev reported that a drone had been shot down near Sevastopol´s local airport. His claims could not be immediately verified. ___ Jill Lawless in London contributed. ___ Follow the AP´s coverage of the war at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine Viktor Bielkin, left, and Anatolii Slobodianik, sift through the rubble of the Kramatorsk College of Technologies and Design, where they're maintenance workers, after it was hit in an early morning rocket attack in Kramatorsk, Donetsk region, eastern Ukraine, Friday, Aug. 19, 2022.

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-11126775/US-lawmakers-meet-detained-Philippine-opposition-leader.html,2022-08-19,US lawmakers meet detained Philippine opposition leader,"U.S. Sen. Edward Markey, who was once banned from the Philippines by former President Rodrigo Duterte, on Friday met a long-detained Filipino opposition leader, whom he says was wrongfully imprisoned under Duterte and should be freed. Markey, a Democrat from Massachusetts, and a group of U.S. legislators met former Sen. Leila de Lima for more than an hour in her high-security detention cell in the main police camp in Metropolitan Manila, according to her lawyer, Filibon Tacardon, and police. Details of their court-authorized meeting were not immediately available. Duterte had banned Markey and two other American legislators from traveling to the Philippines after they called for de Lima´s release and raised alarm over human rights violations under his presidency. Duterte's turbulent six-year term ended in June. The former president's brutal anti-drugs crackdown, which left thousands of mostly poor suspects dead, has sparked an investigation by the International Criminal Court. Duterte was succeeded by Ferdinand Marcos Jr., who took office on June 30 following a landslide election victory with his vice-presidential running mate Sara Duterte, the former president´s daughter. In this photo provided by the Malacanang Presidential Photographers Division, Philippine President Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., left, greets U.S. Sen. Edward Markey during the latter's courtesy call at the Malacanang presidential palace in Manila, Philippines on Thursday Aug. 18, 2022.

(Malacanang Presidential Photographers Division via AP) Markey and his delegation met Marcos Jr. at the Malacanang presidential palace in Manila on Thursday. After the meeting, Marcos Jr. said he looked forward ""to continuing our partnership with the U.S. in the areas of renewable energy use, agricultural development, economic reform, and mitigation of drug problems."" A top critic of Duterte, the 62-year-old de Lima has been locked up for more than five years and has accused the former president and his then-deputies of fabricating the non-bailable drug-linked charges that landed her in jail in February 2017. Her arrest and detention effectively stopped her at the time as a senator from investigating the widespread killings under Duterte's campaign against illegal drugs. Duterte had insisted on her guilt, saying witnesses testified that she received payoffs from imprisoned drug lords. Several witnesses, however, have recently recanted their allegations against her, re-igniting calls for the Marcos Jr. administration to free her. De Lima told The Associated Press in March in her first court-authorized jail interview since her arrest that she ""cried every day, especially at night, in the first few weeks not really out of self-pity but for my family and out of disbelief."" She said she later settled down and continued to fight for human rights and the rule of law from behind bars. She issued more than 1,200 handwritten daily statements from detention, mostly her critical thoughts on Duterte´s governance and reaction to breaking news like the 2020 U.S. electoral triumph of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, which she welcomed as a victory of democracy over ""fabricated populism,"" and Russia´s invasion of Ukraine, which she called ""an act of madness"" that has put the world on edge. She filed more than 600 proposed Senate bills and resolutions from jail, many aimed at strengthening human rights and government accountability and easing poverty. She ran for re-election in the May 9 elections under the main opposition bloc but a trial court banned her from joining online campaigning and debates. Locked away from the campaign trail, de Lima sent a cut-out photo of herself to appear in her place. Amid her detention, de Leila lost her re-election bid. Markey, chairman of the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations East Asia and Pacific Subcommittee, renewed deep concerns over human rights conditions under then-outgoing President Duterte in a joint statement in June with two other U.S. senators. They said then that the incoming administration of Marcos Jr. provided an ""opportunity to reject the repression of the past, release Sen. Leila de Lima and embrace policies that support the rule of law and a vibrant free press in the Philippines."" It was not immediately clear if Markey renewed his call for de Lima´s release in Thursday´s meeting with Marcos Jr. and how the Philippine leader responded.

Not one building in the facility in the northeastern Ukrainian town near the Russian border has escaped getting hit by artillery shells. Since Russia's invasion on Feb. 24, space to treat patients at the hospital has shrunk constantly because of damage. Her staff has dwindled to 47 from 120. And the number of people seeking treatment in the small town 18 kilometers (11 miles) from the border is often higher now than before the fighting began. Ukraine´s health care system struggled for years because of corruption, mismanagement and the COVID-19 pandemic. But the war has only made things worse, with facilities damaged or destroyed, medical staff relocating to safer places and many drugs unavailable or in short supply. Care is being provided in the hardest-hit areas by doctors who have refused to evacuate or have rushed in as volunteers, putting themselves at great risk. ""It´s very hard, but people need us. We have to stay and help,"" said Butova, a neurologist who also is the administrator of the hospital in the town near Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city. She added that she has had to do more with fewer resources. The World Health Organization declared its highest level of emergency in Ukraine the day after the invasion, coordinating a major relief effort there and in neighboring countries whose medical systems also are under strain. Dr. Ilona Butova stands in front of the therapy department which was destroyed after a Russia attack on the hospital in Zolochiv, Kharkiv region, Ukraine, Sunday, July 31, 2022.

But the war with Russia has only made things worse, with facilities damaged or destroyed, medical staff relocating to safer places and many drugs unavailable or in short supply. (AP Photo/Evgeniy Maloletka) About 6.4 million people have fled to other European countries, and a slightly higher number are internally displaced, according to U.N. estimates. That presents a major challenge to a health care system built on family doctor referrals and regionally separate administrations. Across Ukraine, 900 hospitals have been damaged and another 123 have been destroyed, said Health Minister Viktor Liashko, noting: ""Those 123 are gone, and we´re having to find new sites to build replacements."" In addition, scores of pharmacies and ambulances have been destroyed or are seriously damaged, and at least 18 civilian medical staff have been killed and 59 others seriously wounded, he said. ""In occupied areas, the referral system has totally broken down,"" Liashko told The Associated Press. ""People´s health and their lives are in danger."" Kyiv's economy was drained by the conflict with Moscow-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine that began in 2014. When he came to power five years later, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy inherited a health care system that was undermined by reforms launched under his predecessor that had slashed government subsidies and closed many small-town hospitals. During the pandemic, people in those communities had to seek care in large cities - sometimes waiting as long as eight hours for an ambulance in severe cases of COVID-19. As Russia has expanded the territory it controls in eastern and southern Ukraine, the supply of drugs in those areas has dwindled, along with medical staff to administer them. In the southern front-line town of Mykolaiv, ""things have been very difficult,"" volunteer Andrii Skorokhod said. ""Pharmacies have not been working, and shortages have become increasingly acute: Hospital staff were among those evacuated, including specialists. We just need more staff,"" said Skorokhod, who heads a Red Cross initiative to provide residents with free medications. Volunteers like Skorokhod saved the life of 79-year-old Vanda Banderovska, whose home near Mykolaiv was destroyed by Russian artillery. Her 53-year-old son, Roman, was killed, and she was brought to the hospital badly bruised and barely conscious. ""My son went out to the car to get his mobile phone when the Russians started shelling. He was hit in the head,"" she said at a recovery ward, her voice trembling with emotion. ""They´ve destroyed everything and I have nothing left."" Banderovska said she was deeply grateful to the people who saved her life but also overcome by grief and anger. ""The pain I feel is so great. When doctors took me to the hospital I was bruised black and blue but I slowly recovered,"" she said. ___ Derek Gatopoulos reported from Kyiv.

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-11126365/Bomb-threats-tiny-Moldova-Ukraines-neighbor-edge.html,2022-08-19,"Bomb threats put tiny Moldova, Ukraine's neighbor, on edge","For tiny Moldova, an impoverished, landlocked nation that borders war-torn Ukraine but isn't in the European Union or NATO, it's been another week plagued by bomb threats. On an overcast day outside the international airport serving Moldova's capital of Chisinau, hundreds of people lined up this week as bomb-sniffing dogs examined the vicinity. That's now a common scene in Europe´s poorest nation as it battles what observers believe are attempts to destabilize the former Soviet republic amid Russia´s war in Ukraine. Since the beginning of July, Moldova has received nearly 60 bomb threats - with more than 15 reported so far this week - at locations ranging from the capital´s city hall, to the airport, the supreme court, shopping malls and hospitals. While no one has yet been charged for the bomb threats, most of which have arrived via email and all of which have turned out to be false, officials say they have traced computer addresses to Russia, Ukraine and Belarus. ""It is part of the disinformation war against Moldova, which is ongoing,"" said Valeriu Pasa, an analyst at the Chisinau think tank Watchdog.md. ""It could be part of the Russian effort to destabilize Moldova, as they use many different methods to do so."" Since Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, Moldova, which has a population of 2.6 million people, has faced a multitude of crises. It has received more Ukrainian refugees per capita than any other country; tensions have soared in the country's Russia-backed breakaway region; it is dealing with an acute energy crisis; and like much of Europe it is battling skyrocketing inflation. Security personnel and an explosive sniffing dog stand at the entrance of the departures terminal as passengers wait in line at the international airport in Chisinau, Moldova, Tuesday, Aug. 16, 2022. Over the last two months non-European Union Moldova, which shares a border with war-torn Ukraine, has been plagued by scores of bomb threats that have wreaked havoc on the resources of the already overstretched authorities. (AP Photo/Cristian Straista) The frequent bomb threats are only adding pressure to the country's already overstretched authorities. ""It blocks a lot of the resources - police, investigators, technical services - it´s a type of bullying I would say, or harassment, of Moldovan state systems and public services,"" Pasa said. Maxim Motinga, a prosecutor from Moldova´s Office for Combating Organized Crime, told The Associated Press that since the bomb threats started ""practically every day we open criminal cases."" ""At the moment, all criminal investigations are ongoing,"" he said, adding that requests have been made for official assistance from Russia and Ukraine if ""certain tracks leading to the respective countries were established."" ""I hope we get some answers from those countries,"" he said. For Veaceslav Belbas, a 43-year-old Moldovan businessman returning from Turkey to Chisinau on Monday, a bomb threat left him frightened as his plane circled the capital´s airport for 30 minutes. After that, the plane did a U-turn and went back to Turkey. ""We prayed a lot and finally landed,"" he said. ""For me, it was such a big shock that I told my wife that this is my last flight."" Tensions in Moldova soared in April after a series of actual explosions occurred in the Russia-backed breakaway region of Transnistria, where Russia bases about 1,500 troops in a so-called frozen conflict zone. It raised fears that non-NATO, militarily neutral Moldova could get dragged into Russia´s war orbit. At least one Russian official has spoken openly of snatching enough land in southern Ukraine to link up Russian-controlled areas from the mainland to Transnistria. Observers pointed out that the blasts came as Moldova - which has historically close ties with Moscow - showed a growing Western orientation and after it had applied to join the EU, which it did shortly after Russia invaded Ukraine. It was granted EU candidate status in late June, shortly before the bomb threats started. Since Moldova gained independence in 1991, it has been plagued by organized crime and official corruption. After an election in 2019, a local oligarch attempted to seize power, which triggered mass protests before he fled the country. In 2014, several politicians and oligarchs had alleged ties to a scam in which $1 billion vanished from local banks. No one has yet been convicted in that case. Galina Gheorghes was returning to England from Moldova last month after attending a family get-together when a bomb threat canceled her flight. She says she is angry that no one has yet been caught. ""It is very bad what´s happening ... unfortunately, the ordinary people suffer,"" the 35-year-old Gheorghes said. Amid a seemingly endless pattern of disruptive and costly threats, Moldova´s Internal Ministry said it wants to toughen punishments for anyone convicted of false bomb alerts by ramping up fines and handing out lengthier prison sentences. Chisinau Airport has been hit by dozens of bomb threats since July and has bolstered security in response. Radu Zanoaga, head of border police at the airport, says a specialist unit has been established to save security officials the trouble of traveling in from the city center each time a bomb threat is made. ""At the moment, we are dealing with the situation in cooperation with other (state) bodies and institutions that operate within the airport,"" he said.

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-11124929/The-AP-Interview-Refugee-head-sees-lesson-Ukraine-crisis.html,2022-08-18,The AP Interview: Refugee head sees lesson in Ukraine crisis,"Europe's embrace of millions of Ukrainians who fled Russia's invasion showed that it's possible to welcome large numbers of asylum-seekers, and the approach should be replicated to receive those fleeing other nations, the head of the U.N. refugee agency said. In an interview with The Associated Press, U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi described the European Union's response as ""exemplary,"" noting that nearly 4 million Ukrainians, mainly women and children, have registered with the bloc's temporary protection system since the start of the war nearly six months ago. That stands in stark contrast to EU efforts in recent years to keep migrants from Africa and the Middle East from reaching Europe's shores. Some European leaders have sought to differentiate between the plight of Ukrainians and that of other refugees - a distinction that Grandi condemned as ""racist."" ""If that´s possible for such a large number of people, and since that has proven so effective, why not use some of these approaches also for other people that are coming to knock at Europe´s doors?"" Grandi asked. Though it was created decades ago, the EU's emergency protection system was activated for the first time this year in response to the flight of more than 6 million Ukrainians over the course of just a few months - the largest exodus of refugees the continent has seen since World War II. It allows Ukrainians to move around the bloc, gives them the right to work, and helps them to access housing, education and health care. It has been credited with helping Europe avoid setting up refugee camps to house Ukrainians - like the ones that have existed in Greece for years and where thousands of asylum-seekers arriving by boat have often languished. United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi speaks during an interview with The Associated Press at UNHCR headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland, Wednesday, Aug. 17, 2022. Grandi said Europe's embrace of millions of Ukrainians who fled Russia's invasion showed that it's possible to welcome large numbers of asylum-seekers, and the approach should be replicated to receive those fleeing other nations. (AP Photo/Renata Brito) In the wake of the 2015-2016 refugee crisis, when more than 1 million people, mainly from Syria, arrived in Europe by land or sea, leaders erected fences within the EU to keep many from moving deeper into the continent. The bloc has also spent billions to keep people, including those fleeing persecution and conflict but also poverty, from reaching its shores, giving money to countries like Turkey, Libya and Morocco to stop migrants before they set out. The number of irregular crossings into Europe fell from its peak in 2015 to under 200,000 in 2021, according to Europe's border and coast guard agency, although they are on the rise again this year. While such crossings often attract significant attention, more than 80% of the world´s refugees are hosted by developing countries, according to UNHCR. ""Heads of government in Europe spent hours, days negotiating where, who should take a hundred people floating on a boat in the Mediterranean,"" Grandi said, referring to European leaders' inability to agree on how to resettle those who have arrived in recent years in Greece, Italy, Malta and Spain. ""And then contrary to that, millions (of Ukrainians were) embraced, accepted, allowed to have access to services in a very effective manner."" Asked about the different responses, Grandi said he didn't think the European governments' policies themselves were racist. But he added: ""Declarations that I have heard from some politicians saying the Ukrainians are real refugees ... and the others are not real refugees. That´s racist. Full stop."" Grandi didn't specify what statements he was referring to, but Greek Migration Minister Notis Mitarachi was criticized by human rights organizations and opposition lawmakers when he used that phrase to refer to Ukrainians fleeing the war earlier this year. Other European politicians have made similar statements - with some arguing that many people seeking asylum are looking for a better life, rather than fleeing wars, and thus may not qualify for that protection under international law. Some have also defended the differing treatment by saying they have a duty to help fellow Europeans, but shouldn´t be responsible for taking in refugees from other continents. Grandi acknowledged that the issue is complex and some of those heading to Europe are economic migrants. But he stressed that effective systems exist to evaluate asylum claims. Roughly half of the Ukrainians who have left the country so far have returned - and many more may eventually do so, although Grandi said some have ended up fleeing a second time. Still, with no end to the war in sight, the U.N. refugee agency has said the total number of Ukrainians who have left their homeland at some point could reach more than 8 million by December. There are also currently 6.6 million Ukrainians displaced within the country, according to the International Organization for Migration. Around 2 million Ukrainians have ended up in Russia, whether they chose to or not. An AP investigation earlier this year revealed that many were forced to head there and subjected to human rights abuses along the way. Grandi acknowledged that his agency's access in Russia was limited. Of the 1,500 accommodation sites for Ukrainians in the country, UNHCR teams had only been able to visit nine so far, he said. While the war in Ukraine has attracted global attention and support for those displaced by it, Grandi pleaded with world leaders to remember the other 12 humanitarian crises for which his agency is struggling to raise funds. He especially noted the Horn of Africa, where a prolonged drought and protracted conflicts have not only forced millions from their homes, but have also pushed countries ever closer to famine. ""The big problem that we have at the moment is that it tends to marginalize all other crises in which people suffer,"" Grandi said. ___ Follow the AP´s coverage of global migration at https://apnews.com/hub/migration and Russia's war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi poses for a portrait after an interview with The Associated Press at UNHCR headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland, Wednesday, Aug. 17, 2022.

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-11124775/Stars-Coffee-Starbucks-successor-opening-Russia.html,2022-08-18,"Stars Coffee, anyone? Starbucks successor opening in Russia","People in Moscow who were disappointed when Starbucks closed its coffee shops after Russia sent troops into Ukraine may now feel a caffeine jolt of hope: A nearly identical operation is opening in the capital. The name's almost the same: Stars Coffee. The logo could be the separated-at-birth twin of the Starbucks mermaid, with flowing hair, a small enigmatic smile and a star atop her head - though instead of a Starbucks crown she wears a Russian headdress called a kokoshnik. The menu, judging by the company app introduced a day before the store's formal opening Friday, would look familiar to any Starbucks customer. Starbucks said Thursday it had no comment on the new stores. Seattle-based Starbucks was one of the most visible of the wave of foreign companies that pulled out of Russia or suspended their operations in response to Russia's military operation in Ukraine. Others include McDonald's, IKEA and fast-fashion giant H&M. The departure of these companies was a psychological blow to Russians who had become used to the comforts of Western-style consumer culture. But Russian entrepreneurs saw opportunity in suddenly unoccupied stores.

(AP Photo/Dmitry Serebryakov) Former McDonald's outlets are reopening and attracting sizable crowds under the name Vkusno - i Tochka. Though the name doesn't roll off the tongue easily and is a little awkward to translate (roughly: It's Tasty - Period), the menu is a testament to imitation being the sincerest form of flattery. Yunus Yusupov, a popular rap artist who uses the stage name Timati, and restaurateur Anton Pinsky partnered to buy the Starbucks assets, then took the imitation strategy a step further by giving the operation an English-language name. At a news conference Thursday, they vowed to reopen all the former Starbucks under their new identity and even expand the business. The U.S. company had built its Russian operation to about 130 stores since entering the country in 2007. The stores were owned and operated by a franchisee, Alshaya Group of Kuwait. While the close resemblance of the new operations to their predecessors could be seen as riding someone else's inspiration and effort, the Starbucks and McDonald's successors also fit a national-pride concept. Since Russia was walloped by sanctions and foreign pullouts, officials frequently assert that Russia will overcome by relying on its own resources and energies. ""Now the economic situation is difficult, but this is a time of opportunity,"" Oleg Eskindarov, president of the holding company that partnered in the Starbucks deal, told the state news agency Tass. ""For the past four months, we have been very actively looking at exiting companies following the example of Starbucks. There are several more similar examples, but we cannot talk about them yet.""

The small Baltic country, which shares a 300-kilometer (190-mile) border with Russia, stopped issuing tourist visas to Russians months ago, and as of Thursday no longer accepts those previously issued. ""Our idea is to give a signal to all our European partners, all our Western community partners, to close down our borders to Russian citizens, except humanitarian cases,"" Foreign Minister Urmas Reinsalu told The Associated Press in an interview in Tallinn. ""Russian citizens are not welcome in Europe. Their country is committing a genocidal war against an innocent people."" Despite bans on air travel from Russia to the European Union, Russians have been able to vacation in western Europe this summer by traveling by land through Estonia and other neighboring countries with tourist visas that are valid throughout Europe´s border-free travel zone. Reinsalu said ""hundreds of thousands"" of Russian citizens passing through Estonian soil posed an ""evident security threat"" and dismissed concerns that the visa ban could backfire by turning ordinary Russians against Europe and the West. He said the legal responsibility for the war in Ukraine lies with Putin and his inner circle, ""but there is also a ... moral responsibility of Russian citizens as citizens of (the) aggressor state.""

Estonia's foreign minister on Thursday defended his country's decision to bar Russian tourists, saying they are shirking their ""moral responsibility"" to stand up to Russian President Vladimir Putin's regime and its ""genocidal war"" in Ukraine. (AP Photo/Sergei Grits) ""They have to wake up and protest against the regime´s atrocities. Their tax money literally is used to buy rockets and bombs to kill children in Ukraine,"" he said. Exceptions to the entry ban include diplomats and Russians visiting close relatives in Estonia. It doesn´t affect Russians with visas issued by other EU countries or those allowed to enter Estonia on humanitarian grounds, but Estonian officials said they were working on proposals to also bar Russians with tourist visas issued by other EU countries. Estonia, Finland and other EU countries bordering Russia have been pushing for an EU-wide ban on Russian tourists, but some leaders, including German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, have dismissed the idea as counterproductive. ""This is not the war of the Russian people. It is Putin´s war and we have to be very clear on that topic,"" Scholz said. A Russian Foreign Ministry official said Thursday that Moscow is not ruling out the possibility of an EU-wide ban and will respond in any case. ""These steps will not go unanswered by the Russian side. You´ll know about (retaliatory measures) soon,"" Ivan Nechaev, deputy head of the ministry's communications department, told reporters. Reinsalu mocked concerns that the ""peaceful lives"" of Russians would be disrupted by denying them the chance to visit tourist attractions like the Louvre museum in Paris, the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin or the canals of Venice. ""I think that there is no peaceful life in Ukraine, and our perspective is ending the genocidal war - this is a strategic aim,"" he said. Estonia and its Baltic neighbors Latvia and Lithuania endured five decades of Soviet occupation and have been strong advocates in the EU for harsh sanctions against Russia and robust military aid to Ukraine. Reinsalu also defended the government's decision to dismantle remaining Soviet-era monuments, including a tank removed this week from a memorial to Red Army soldiers killed during World War II from the eastern city of Narva on the Russian border. The government said such monuments could be used by the Kremlin to sow divisions in Estonia, which has a significant ethnic Russian minority. ""The one thing we have learnt from the past (is) that you have to act decisively and not let the tensions rise,"" Reinsalu said. -- Associated Press writer Karl Ritter in Stockholm contributed to this report.

According to a statement, President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi named Hassan Abdullah to succeed Tarek Amer, who had held the post since 2015. The appointment still needs to be ratified by the state-controlled parliament, which is in recess until October. In a meeting with the new appointee, el-Sissi stressed the importance of upgrading the country's monetary policies to cope with global economic changes and to diversify Egypt's sources of foreign currency, the statement also said. Abduallah, 62, had worked as a banker for almost four decades in Egypt until he became the CEO of the Arab African International Bank in 2004. In May 2021, he was appointed the chairman of United Media Services, a state-controlled media conglomerate. On Wednesday, el-Sissi accepted Amer's resignation and named the outgoing governor a presidential adviser. The president´s office offered no explanation for Amer´s resignation. Amer had traditionally been seen as in the camp that supported the pound´s depreciation as a way to secure a new loan from the International Monetary Fund in order to address the growing budget deficit.

According to a Wednesday, Aug. 17, 2022 statement from President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi's office, el-Sissi accepted the resignation and named him a presidential adviser. The brief statement offered no reason for Amer's resignation and no replacement was immediately named. (AP Photo/Nariman El-Mofty, File) His resignation came after key ministries were reshuffled on Saturday, a Cabinet shake-up approved by parliament in an emergency session. A total of 13 ministries were affected, including health, education, culture, local development and irrigation. The country´s minister of tourism and antiquities also was replaced. The Egyptian currency has slid to more than 19 Egyptian pounds to the dollar. That followed a central bank decision allowing the currency to depreciate by around 16% in March to try to stem a growing trade deficit. Russia´s war in Ukraine has been deeply felt in other ways in Egypt. The Arab world's most populous country is also the world´s largest wheat importer that sources around 80% of it from the Black Sea region. Following Russia's invasion in late February, the price of wheat and other grains skyrocketed, as did the price of fuel. Although prices have come down somewhat, the cost of grains remains at least 50% higher than before the pandemic in early 2020. Furthermore, the cost of shipping to export those grains through the Black Sea is high. Inflation in the country of 103 million people reached 14.6% in July, increasing pressure on lower-income households and everyday necessities. Around a third of Egyptians live in poverty, according to government figures. Meanwhile, an investigation by the country's public prosecutor said in a statement Thursday that a fire in a Cairo church last Sunday that killed 41 people, including 15 children, was the result of a short circuit in the building's generator, a backup source of power. The tragedy at the Martyr Abu Sefein church in the working-class neighborhood of Imbaba threw the country into mourning but also raised questions about emergency response, fire safety codes and restrictions on building houses of worship for the country´s Christian minority."

The Nordic country´s Border Guard started a preliminary investigation into the incident. The deployment of Kinzhal missiles to Kaliningrad as Russia´s campaign in Ukraine nears the sixth-month mark appeared intended to showcase the Russian military´s capability to threaten NATO assets.

Russia has used the weapon to strike several targets in Ukraine. Kaliningrad´s location has put it in the forefront of Moscow´s efforts to counter what it described as NATO´s hostile policies. The Kremlin has methodically bolstered its military forces there, arming them with state-of-the-art weapons, including precision-guided Iskander missiles and an array of air defense systems. ""The events in Ukraine demonstrated that a clash with the collective West is a real possibility,"" Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman Ivan Nechayev said Thursday while emphasizing that a ""direct confrontation with the U.S. and NATO isn´t in our interests."" Speaking at a briefing, Nechayev said: ""Russia as a nuclear power will continue to act with maximum responsibility"" and ""the Russian military doctrine envisages a nuclear response only in retaliation to an aggression involving weapons of mass destruction or in a situation when the very existence of the state comes under threat."" The Russian military is equipped with conventional weapons that ""allow it to fully implement the goals set by the Russian president,"" he added. ""We proceed from the assumption that the U.S. and NATO are aware where their aggressive anti-Russian rhetoric with an emphasis on a possible use of nuclear weapons can lead to,"" Nechayev said. He said Russia believes that ""a nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought,"" a view reaffirmed by five nuclear powers earlier this year.

Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic and Kosovo Prime Minister Albin Kurti held talks in Brussels during a meeting that the EU's top diplomat said took place ""in a crisis management mode."" Josep Borrell, the EU's high representative for foreign affairs, announced after the meeting, ""today, there is no agreement."" He said Kurti and Vucic did consent to more discussions in the coming days to hasten the process of normalizing ties between their countries, which were at war in 1998-99. Kosovo is a former province of Serbia, which has refused to recognize the country´s 2008 declaration of independence. A NATO-led intervention in 1999 ended a war between Serbian forces and separatists in Kosovo and stopped Belgrade´s bloody crackdown against majority Kosovo Albanians. The EU has overseen years of talks to normalize their ties, saying that´s one of the main preconditions for Kosovo and Serbia's eventual membership in the 27-nation bloc. The purpose of Thursday's meeting ""was to calm down the situation on the ground,"" Borrell said. Tensions between Serbia and Kosovo soared anew late last month when Kurti´s government declared that Serbian identity documents and vehicle license plates would no longer be valid in Kosovo's territory.

(AP Photo/Virginia Mayo) Serbia has been implementing the same measures for Kosovo citizens crossing into Serbia for the past 10 years, saying if it recognized the Kosovo registration plates and documents it would mean it recognizes Kosovo as an independent country. Minority Serbs, who live mostly in northern Kosovo, reacted with anger to the proposed change, putting up roadblocks, sounding air raid sirens and firing guns into the air and in the direction of Kosovo police officers. No one was injured. Under apparent pressure from the West, Kurti postponed the implementation of the measure for a month, to Sept. 1, when more trouble is expected if a compromise is not reached by then. ""We are at a critical time for Europe,"" Borrell said. ""After the Russia invasion of Ukraine, we are facing a dramatic and very dangerous moment for our continent, and this is not a moment for increasing tensions."" ""It is time for looking for solutions of long-standing issues,"" he added. In a video clip posted on Instagram, Vucic said he will address his nation on Friday. ""A difficult day is behind us, it was hard for all Serbian citizens, for whole of our country,"" Vucic said. ""I cannot say it ended successfully. But I hope and wish that by some miracle we could reach a compromise agreement in the days that are ahead."" Along with Serbia, its allies Russia and China don´t recognize Kosovo´s independence, which is supported by the United States and most other Western states. There are fears in the West that Russia could encourage Serbia into an armed intervention in northern Kosovo that would further destabilize the Balkans and shift at least some attention from Russia's war in Ukraine. ___ AP writers Dusan Stojanovic and Jovana Gec contributed from Belgrade, Serbia.

In a statement following a monetary policy committee meeting, the bank said it decided to reduce the policy rate from 14% to 13%. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has pressured the bank into lowering borrowing costs in a bid to boost economic growth, investment and exports, insisting that interest rate hikes cause inflation. That contradicts established economic thinking, with rate increases the traditional tool to target inflation. Central banks worldwide are raising interest rates as rising food and energy prices drive inflation to decades-high levels. Even then, inflation figures in the U.S. of 8.5%, the United Kingdom of 10.1% and the 19-country euro area of 8.9% come nowhere close to Turkey's eye-popping rate of nearly 80%, with skyrocketing food, housing and energy prices hitting people hard. Turkey's central bank made a series of interest rate cuts last year despite high inflation, dropping rates by 5 percentage points before pausing in January. The cuts triggered a currency crisis and further fueled rising consumer prices, while Russia´s invasion of Ukraine and soaring energy costs aggravated the situation. The Turkish lira weakened by nearly 1% against the dollar shortly after Thursday's central bank decision.

The announcement at a hastily convened news conference in Berlin comes a day after Scholz met with hostile protests during a town hall event outside the capital. Scholz said his government had decided to lower the value-added tax on gas from 19% to 7% until the end of March 2024. ""The rising gas prices are a big burden for many citizens,"" Scholz said, adding that further measures would be announced in the coming weeks. In addition to rising wholesale prices for natural gas caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine earlier this year, German consumers will have to pay a new surcharge to prop up energy companies scrambling to find new supplies on the global market. Russia has reduced flows of natural gas - used to generate electricity, run factories and heat homes in the winter - to Germany and other European countries, and there are fears of more cutbacks as the weather gets colder and demand increases. The resulting high prices are fueling inflation, eroding people's spending power and raising the possibility of a recession. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz gestures at a dialogue event in Neuruppin, Germany, Wednesday, Aug. 17, 2022. (Carsten Koall/dpa via AP) Scholz said lowering the tax on gas purchases in general would more than make up for the new surcharges, effectively meaning that they will be paid for from government coffers. The German leader said the issue was a matter of ""justice ... to ensure that the country remains united during this crisis."" Scholz was confronted late Wednesday with angry chants from protesters during a town hall event in Neuruppin, 50 kilometers (31 miles) northwest of the capital. Videos showed several hundred people standing outside the security fence surrounding the event, some shouting ""Traitor!"" and ""Beat it!"" German news agency dpa reported that the protesters were organized by the far-right Alternative for Germany and the Left party. Experts, however, questioned whether the tax reduction was the right measure, given that the German government is also trying to get people to use less gas. ""Gas is in very short supply at the moment, that's why gas prices are high,"" said Stefan Kooths of the Kiel Institute for the World Economy. ""In such a situation, it's not appropriate to water down price signals through state intervention in the tax rules."" Kooths said it would have been better for the German government to tax gas in full and use the revenues to help those who are hardest hit by rising energy prices. ___ Follow all AP stories on the fallout from the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine.

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-11123447/Usyk-fighting-Ukraine-Joshua-future-rematch.html,2022-08-18,"Usyk fighting for Ukraine, Joshua for future in rematch","Dressed in traditional Cossack clothing, Oleksandr Usyk followed up his face-off with Anthony Joshua by performing a Ukrainian resistance song on stage. Clapping his hands rhythmically, Usyk - with a horseshoe mustache and those steely eyes of his - broke into ""Oi u luzi chervona kalyna,"" a song from 1875 inspired by Ukraine´s 18th-century struggle for independence and now chanted in defiance amid the war with Russia. Joshua didn´t hang around, exiting the stage while Usyk´s team joined in the singing. If it wasn´t already clear, Usyk is fighting for much more than his world heavyweight belts in his rematch with Joshua in Saudi Arabia. Just six months ago, Usyk was patrolling the streets of Kyiv with an automatic rifle as part of his capital city´s Territorial Defense Force, praying he wouldn´t need to pull the trigger. On Saturday, he´ll be in Jeddah, serving his country in a very different way - by attempting to retain the WBA, IBF and WBO titles he claimed from Joshua in London last September. Ukraine's Oleksandr Usyk speaks during a press conference in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, Wednesday, Aug. 17, 2022. Britain's Anthony Joshua is due to fight defending champion Oleksandr Usyk in a heavyweight boxing rematch in Jeddah on Aug. 20. (AP Photo/Hassan Ammar) ""At one point,"" Usyk said in the buildup to the rematch, ""I went to the hospital where soldiers were wounded and getting rehabilitation, and they asked me to go, to fight (Joshua), to fight for the country. ""They said if you go there, you´re going to help our country even more instead of fighting inside Ukraine."" How about that for motivation? Usyk left Ukraine in March for a training camp in Poland and more recently in Dubai. He has had to spend so much time away from his family - he has a wife, Yekaterina, and three kids - and that has not been easy. But he is determined to provide some joy to his country, where the fight will be broadcast free of charge in a decision by organizers sparked by Usyk´s original push to buy the TV rights for the bout. ""I´m very pleased about that,"" he said. ""We all worked hard on it."" Joshua, seeking to become a three-time heavyweight champion, is in the rare position of being an underdog after being dominated in the first fight, losing by unanimous decision. After a clinic in movement and fast punching by Usyk, Joshua ended the fight slumped on the ropes and with a closed right eye. He hadn´t been able to take advantage of his longer reach and supposed extra power, and struggled with fighting a southpaw. The 32-year-old Joshua should be better prepared this time, having hired a new trainer in widely esteemed Robert Garcia, a former IBF super-featherweight champion who has Jose Ramirez, Jesse Rodriguez and Mikey Garcia - his younger brother and a four-weight world champion - in his stable. Joshua will have a different game plan, for sure - he surely won´t attempt to outbox Usyk like last time - but does he have the talent to beat a man who has stepped up from cruiserweight and still looks at home? Usyk appears to have bulked up since the first fight, too. ""I feel like one of my main strengths is that I´m a quick learner, I´m a sponge,"" Joshua said Wednesday at the final head-to-head. ""But ultimately, apart from all of the learning stuff, it´s a fight. That´s it. Whoever throws the most punches and lands the most punches wins."" This will be Joshua´s second fight in Saudi Arabia and he arrived in the kingdom a month ago, looking to regain his belts like he did in 2019 when he beat Andy Ruiz Jr. in a rematch in Riyadh. After that victory, he told reporters that coming to fight in Saudi Arabia has ""made me more aware of the issues"" in the country. The topic of conversation was ""sportswashing"" - the use of sports to burnish the kingdom´s image and downplay concerns about its human rights issues. Still, Joshua is back there again, for a fight the Saudis have reportedly paid $80 million to stage. He has called Saudi Arabia his ""second home"" and insisted his presence isn´t helping to sanitize the kingdom. When asked again about sportswashing, he said ""I don´t know what that is."" ""The world´s in a bad place - I can´t just point one place out,"" he said. ""If you want to point Saudi out, let´s point everyone out. We´ve all got to do better and that´s where my heart is. The whole world has got to do better if it wants to change. ""I feel like I bring light. Boxing is such a dark industry. There´s so much negativity, tearing each other down, and egos. I´m not really into that, I´m just trying to bring light to people."" It feels like a defining fight, both for Joshua´s career and for Usyk´s life. Heavyweight title matches can often be accompanied with potential plans for future fights and opponents, but both Joshua and Usyk are very much living in the present. ""He was in touch with high-ranking military officers and he visited the hospitals with injured soldiers. In every conversation, he heard words of blessing and support to take the rematch,"" Usyk´s promoter, Alexander Krassyuk, said of his fighter. ""People wanted him to fight. People still want him to win. People want the Ukrainian flag to rise, people want the Ukrainian anthem to be heard throughout the whole planet. Not many men in the world can deliver this to millions of people."" ___ More AP sports: https://apnews.com/hub/apf-sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports Britain's Anthony Joshua speaks during a press conference in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, Wednesday, Aug. 17, 2022.

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-11123379/Ship-Ukraine-alleges-stolen-grain-likely-Syria.html,2022-08-18,Ship that Ukraine alleges has stolen wheat likely off Syria,"A Russian cargo ship that Ukraine alleges holds stolen wheat from territory seized by Moscow appears to have reached the Syrian port of Tartus, according to satellite images analyzed Thursday by The Associated Press. The arrival of the SV Konstantin marks just the latest shipment of Ukrainian grain - whether legally purchased or allegedly looted - to reach Syria. Another vessel, the Razoni, recently docked full of legally purchased Ukrainian corn as part of a United Nations-led effort to get the country's food out of the war zone to a hungry world. The Konstantin's arrival also shows the level Damascus has relied on Russia to keep Syria's embattled President Bashar Assad in power amid his own nation's yearslong war, particularly at this Mediterranean Sea port that hosts Russian warships and has crucial Russian-run grain silos. The Konstantin traveled from the Russian-occupied Crimean Peninsula in the Black Sea from around July 6, according to ship-tracking data from MarineTraffic.com analyzed by the AP. The ship had loaded Ukrainian wheat at Sevastopol, the Ukrainian Embassy in Lebanon said in a statement to the AP on Thursday. That port city in Crimea has seen Russian forces previously bring grain by truck from occupied territories, Ukrainian officials say. The Konstantin traveled through the Bosphorus and reached the Turkish city of Izmir on the Aegean Sea. The ship then headed further into the Mediterranean along the coast of Cyprus before switching off its Automatic Identification System tracker on Sunday. Ships are supposed to keep their AIS trackers on, but vessels wanting to hide their movements often turn theirs off. Those heading to Syrian ports routinely do so. This satellite image from Planet Labs PBC shows the Russian-flagged cargo ship SV Konstantin, the red vessel the furtherest left, off the port in Tartus, Syria, Wednesday, Aug. 17, 2022. The Konstantin, that Ukraine alleges holds stolen grain from territory seized by Moscow amid the war there, appears to have reached the Syrian port of Tartus, satellite images analyzed Thursday by The Associated Press show. (Planet Labs PBC via AP) Satellite images from Planet Labs PBC analyzed by the AP show the Konstantin off the coast of Tartus on Tuesday and Wednesday. The vessel's length, width and appearance resembles previous Planet Labs images of the ship taken at a time corresponding to when its AIS tracker was still on north of Cyprus. Yoruk Isik, a non-resident scholar at the Washington-based Middle East Institute who monitors shipping through the Bosphorus, has been tracking the Konstantin. He and other open-source intelligence analysts first said they believed the vessel to be off Tartus as well, based on the satellite photos. After being contacted by the AP, the Ukrainian Embassy in Lebanon similarly said that it believed the Konstantin had arrived to Syria after earlier claiming it would head to Tripoli, Lebanon. ""Onboard of this ship there are grains that were plundered and illegally transported by the Russian occupation authorities from the storage facilities located on temporarily occupied territories in Zaporizhzhya, Kherson and Mykolaiv,"" the embassy said. Officials at Tartus port could not be reached for comment. Syria´s mission to the United Nations did not respond to a request for comment. Syria remains sanctioned by the West over killing and abuses of civilians during the civil war, though food supplies have been exempted by the West. Already in May, satellite images showed the Russian-flagged Matros Pozynich at dockside in Latakia, Syria. Ukraine said the ship had 27,000 tons of grain Russia stolen from it and initially tried to sell to Egypt, which refused to take the cargo. Tartus, on the Mediterranean Sea, lies about 320 kilometers (200 miles) northwest of Syria´s capital, Damascus. Russia's Soviet-era naval base there is Moscow's only such facility outside the former Soviet Union. In 2017, Moscow struck a deal with Assad´s government to extend its lease on Tartus for 49 years. The agreement allows Russia to keep up to 11 warships there, including nuclear-powered ones. Satellite photos this week showed at least two Russian submarines and other warships at the port. Russian firm Stroytransgaz, owned by billionaire oligarch Gennady Timchenko through his investment firm Volga Group, runs the port. Timchenko, who is close to Russian President Vladimir Putin, is sanctioned by the European Union and the U.S. Stroytransgaz did not respond to a request for comment. ___ Associated Press writer Kareem Chehayeb in Beirut contributed to this report. ___ Follow Jon Gambrell on Twitter at www.twitter.com/jongambrellAP."

Ethiopia´s conflict has serious regional implications, with the potential to destabilize the strategic and sometimes turbulent Horn of Africa region.

(Johanna Geron/Pool Photo via AP, File) Aid has started flowing more substantially in the past few months amid international mediation efforts, but the deliveries are widely described as inadequate to meet the needs of the millions of people essentially trapped there. Aid groups say major shortages of fuel to deliver supplies remain. The resumption of basic services and banking remains a key demand of the Tigray leaders. On Thursday, the prime minister´s spokeswoman said ""an operable environment needs to happen"" for the return of those services, including safety guarantees for service workers in the region. She also noted a government proposal for ""peace talks in the coming weeks"" and stressed they must be without preconditions. She accused the Tigray leaders of ""looking for excuses to avoid these peace talks."" She dismissed Tigray forces' allegations of new attacks by Ethiopian forces as ""a mechanism to deflect"" discussions on the peace process.

But little immediate progress was reported. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said he would follow up with Russian President Vladimir Putin, given that most of the matters discussed would require the Kremlin's agreement. With the meetings held at such a high level - it was the first visit to Ukraine by Erdogan since the war began, and the second by U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres - some had hoped for breakthroughs, if not toward an overall peace, then at least on specific issues. But none was apparent. Meeting in the western city of Lviv, far from the front lines, the leaders discussed expanding exchanges of prisoners of war and arranging for U.N. atomic energy experts to visit and help secure Europe's biggest nuclear power plant, which is in the middle of fierce fighting that has raised fears of catastrophe. Erdogan has positioned himself as a go-between in efforts to stop the fighting. While Turkey is a member of NATO, its wobbly economy is reliant on Russia for trade, and it has tried to steer a middle course between the two combatants. The Turkish president urged the international community after the talks not to abandon diplomatic efforts to end the war that has killed tens of thousands and forced more than 10 million Ukrainians from their homes. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, center, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, left, and United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres shake hands after their meeting in Lviv, Ukraine, Thursday, Aug. 18, 2022. (AP Photo/Evgeniy Maloletka) He repeated that Turkey is willing to act as ""mediator and facilitator"" and added, ""I remain convinced that the war will end at the negotiating table."" In March, Turkey hosted talks in Istanbul between Russian and Ukrainian negotiators that failed to end the hostilities. On the battlefield, meanwhile, at least 17 people were killed overnight in heavy Russian missile strikes on Ukraine´s Kharkiv region, Ukrainian authorities said Thursday. Russia's military claimed that it struck a base for foreign mercenaries in Kharkiv, killing 90. There was no immediate comment from the Ukrainian side. In the latest incident on Russian soil near the border with Ukraine, an ammunition dump caught fire in a village in the Belgorod region, the regional governor said. No casualties were reported. Video posted online, whose authenticity couldn´t be verified, showed orange flames and black smoke, with the sound of multiple explosions. Elsewhere, Russian officials reported that anti-aircraft defenses shot down drones in the Russian-occupied Crimean Peninsula at Kerch and near the Belbek airfield in the Black Sea port of Sevastopol. Explosions in recent weeks on the peninsula have destroyed warplanes and caused other damage at military airfields. Heightening international tensions, Russia deployed warplanes carrying state-of-the-art hypersonic missiles to its Kaliningrad region, an enclave surrounded by NATO members Lithuania and Poland. One major topic at the talks in Lviv was the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in southern Ukraine. Moscow and Kyiv have accused each other of shelling the complex. Condemning the Kremlin for what he called ""nuclear blackmail,"" Zelenskyy demanded that Russian troops leave the plant and that a team from the U.N.'s International Atomic Energy Agency be allowed in. ""The area needs to be demilitarized, and we must tell it as it is: Any potential damage in Zaporizhzhia is suicide,"" Guterres said at a news conference. Erdogan likewise expressed concern over the fighting around the plant, saying, ""We don´t want to experience another Chernobyl"" - a reference to the world´s worst nuclear accident, in Ukraine in 1986. Zelenskyy and the U.N. chief agreed Thursday on arrangements for an IAEA mission to the plant, according to the president's website. But it was not immediately clear whether the Kremlin would consent to the terms. As for a pullout of troops, a Russian Foreign Ministry official said earlier that that would leave the plant ""vulnerable."" Fears mounted Thursday when Russian and Ukrainian authorities accused each other of plotting to attack the site and then blame the other side. Late Thursday, multiple rounds of Ukrainian shelling struck the city in which the power plant is located, a Russian official reported. Guterres used the talks in Lviv to name Gen. Carlos dos Santos Cruz of Brazil to lead a previously announced U.N. fact-finding mission to the Olenivka prison where 53 Ukrainian POWs were killed in an explosion in July. Russia and Ukraine have blamed each other for the blast. Also on the agenda Thursday: an increase in grain exports. Earlier this summer, the U.N. and Turkey brokered an agreement clearing the way for Ukraine to export 22 million tons of corn and other grain stuck in its Black Sea ports since the Russian invasion. The blockage has worsened world food shortages, driven up prices and heightened fears of famine, especially in Africa. Yet even with the deal, only a trickle of Ukrainian grain has made it out - some 600,000 tons by Turkey's estimate. Zelenskyy said Thursday that he proposed expanding the shipments. Guterres, for his part, touted the operation's success but added, ""There is a long way to go before this will be translated into the daily life of people at their local bakery and in their markets."" ___ Suzan Fraser reported from Ankara, Turkey.

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-11122739/China-Japan-officials-meet-amid-Taiwan-tensions.html,2022-08-18,"China, Japan officials meet amid Taiwan tensions","Chinese and Japanese officials have met in northern China amid renewed tensions over Beijing's military threats against Taiwan and after Tokyo protested China's firing of missiles into Japan's exclusive economic zone during recent military drills. The meeting Wednesday between senior foreign affairs advisor Yang Jiechi and the head of Japan´s National Security Secretariat, Akiba Takeo, followed China´s cancellation of a meeting between the foreign ministers of the two countries after Japan signed on to a statement from the Group of Seven industrialized countries criticizing China´s threatening war games surrounding Taiwan earlier this month. Japan issued diplomatic protests over China´s firing of missiles into its exclusive economic zone during the drills, which saw Chinese warplanes and navy ships cross the middle zone of the Taiwan Strait that has long been a buffer between the sides. China claims Taiwan as its own territory, to be annexed by force if necessary. The former Japanese colony has been under Chinese military threat since Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalist government fled to the island in 1949 as Mao Zedong's Communist Party seized control of the Chinese mainland. In his comments to Takeo, Yang said ""the Taiwan question bears on the political foundation of China-Japan relations and the basic trust and good faith between the two countries,"" China's official Xinhua News Agency reported Thursday. ""Japan should ... shape up a right perception of China, pursue a positive, pragmatic and rational China policy, and uphold the right direction of peaceful development,"" Xinhua quoted Yang as saying. In this photo released by Xinhua News Agency, Yang Jiechi, right, a member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee and director of the Office of the Foreign Affairs Commission of the CPC Central Committee, poses for photos with Akiba Takeo, head of Japan's National Security Secretariat, during the ninth China-Japan high-level political dialogue in Tianjin municipality in northern China Wednesday, Aug. 17, 2022. Chinese and Japanese officials have met in northern China amid renewed tensions over China's military threats against Taiwan that have prompted protests from Tokyo over the firing of Chinese missiles into Japan's exclusive economic zone. (Zhao Zishuo/Xinhua via AP) China's nearly two weeks of military exercises surrounding Taiwan followed U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's visit to the island in defiance of Beijing's threats. China announced further drills in response to the visit by another Congressional delegation this week, but has not said when or where they will take place. The exercises appear to have had little impact among Taiwan's more than 23 million people, who overwhelmingly favor the status quo of de facto independence while maintaining robust economic ties with China. Takeo met earlier this month with U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan in Washington, during which they ""reiterated the importance of maintaining peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait and reinforced their resolve to stand united against Russia´s unjust and unprovoked war on Ukraine and united in support of the Ukrainian people,"" the State Department said in a news release. China's threats against Taiwan have been likened to Russia's invasion of its neighbor. Shortly before Moscow dispatched troops in February, Russian President Vladimir Putin and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping met in Beijing, where they declared their relationship had ""no limits"" and Russia supported China's claim to Taiwan. Many Chinese also resent Japan over its brutal invasion and occupation of parts of the country during the 1930s and 1940s, sentiments kept alive by Communist Party propaganda. In an incident reported widely on social media, a Chinese woman wearing a traditional Japanese kimono dress was recently detained by police in the eastern city of Hangzhou for allegedly creating a disturbance. She was reportedly released without charge after writing an apology."
https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-11119705/Egypt-says-central-bank-governor-resigns-amid-economic-woes.html,2022-08-17,Egypt's central bank governor resigns as economic woes mount,"Egypt´s central bank governor resigned Wednesday as the Middle East's most populous nation struggles to curb inflation triggered by Russia's war in Ukraine, high oil prices and a drop in tourism. President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi accepted the resignation of Tarek Amer and named him a presidential adviser, the Egyptian leader´s office said in a statement. The brief statement offered no explanation for Amer´s resignation. No replacement was immediately named for Amer, who had been appointed governor of the central bank in November 2015. He has been criticized for his handling of Egypt´s financial challenges. The currency is under pressure, sliding in value to more than 19 Egyptian pounds to the dollar. That followed a central bank decision allowing the currency to depreciate by around 16% in March to try to stem a growing trade deficit. ""It seems there's a lot of tensions within policymaking circles, and I think that's ultimately what led to Mr. Amer's resignation,"" said Jason Tuvey, a senior emerging markets economist at Capital Economics. Tuvey said there are officials that oppose devaluing the pound and instead support measures like rationing gas consumption by curbing electricity usage, which could in turn harm business activity. Amer had traditionally been seen as in the camp that supported the pound's depreciation as a way to secure a loan from the International Monetary Fund. FILE - Egyptian Central Bank Governor Tarek Amer speaks during a press conference at the Central Bank of Egypt in Cairo, Nov. 3, 2016. Amer resigned as the country has struggled to address its financial woes. According to a Wednesday, Aug. 17, 2022 statement from President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi's office, el-Sissi accepted the resignation and named him a presidential adviser. The brief statement offered no reason for Amer's resignation and no replacement was immediately named. (AP Photo/Nariman El-Mofty, File) The London-based Capital Economics research firm predicts that Egypt´s currency will continue to slide, reaching 25 pounds to the dollar by the end of 2024 amid sustained pressure. The resignation of the central bank head comes after key ministries were reshuffled Saturday as the government faces mounting pressure from economic challenges. The Cabinet shake-up, which was approved by parliament in an emergency session, affected 13 ministries, including health, education, culture, local development and irrigation. The country´s minister of tourism and antiquities also was replaced. Egypt´s expansive tourism industry, which employs millions, was hit hard by years of turmoil, the COVID-19 pandemic and then the war in Ukraine. Prior to the conflict, around a third of tourists to Egypt came from Russia. Russia´s war has been deeply felt in other ways in Egypt, the world´s largest wheat importer that sources around 80% of it from the Black Sea region. In the first weeks after the invasion of Ukraine in late February, the price of wheat and other grains skyrocketed, as did the price of fuel. Although prices have come down somewhat, the cost of grains remains at least 50% higher than before the pandemic in early 2020. Furthermore, the cost of shipping to export those grains through the Black Sea is high. Inflation in the country of 103 million people reached 14.6% in July, increasing pressure on lower-income households and everyday necessities. Around a third of Egyptians live in poverty, according to government figures. The World Bank notes that Egypt's government announced an assistance package worth 130 billion pounds (more than $8 billion) just before devaluing the pound in March to alleviate the impact of rising prices. The package aimed to increase public-sector wages and pensions, as well as expand direct cash assistance programs. Egypt's Gulf Arab allies have come to its assistance with multibillion-dollar investments buoyed by high oil prices that have helped their bottom line. Saudi Arabia´s sovereign wealth fund, known as the Public Investment Fund, recently established a division in Egypt that has already announced deals worth $1.3 billion with the aim of bringing in $10 billion into Egypt. ___ Batrawy reported from Dubai, United Arab Emirates."
https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-11119691/EU-host-Serbia-Kosovo-talks-Brussels-amid-tensions.html,2022-08-17,EU to host Serbia-Kosovo talks in Brussels amid tensions,"Wartime rivals Serbia and Kosovo are holding high-level crisis talks on Thursday which European Union mediators hope will de-escalate growing tensions in the Balkans, where Russia has tried to further increase its influence amid the war in Ukraine. Hopes that the rare face-to-face meeting between Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic and Kosovo Prime Minister Albin Kurti, to be held in Brussels, could produce a major breakthrough are slim. But Western officials overseeing the decades-old deadlock between the two neighbors hope that it would at least reduce the increasingly war-mongering rhetoric coming from both sides. ""All open issues will be addressed and should be addressed through the EU-facilitated dialogue,"" European Commission spokesperson for foreign affairs Nabila Massrali told reporters. ""Both parties must end their hostilities at this point"" and ""act responsibly."" NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg, who separately met Vucic and Kurti in Brussels on Wednesday, said NATO-led troops stationed in Kosovo have strengthened their presence on Kosovo´s northern border with Serbia because of the current tensions. ""But of course, we will act when needed and we will act in a proportionate way because our main aim is to help to reduce tensions and to ensure all communities to freedom of movement, to the safety of all communities, including, of course, the Serbs in Kosovo,"" Stoltenberg said. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, right, speaks with Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic prior to a meeting at NATO headquarters in Brussels, Wednesday, Aug. 17, 2022. (AP Photo/Olivier Matthys) He urged ""all parties to engage positively and constructively in the latest round of the EU talks tomorrow."" Kosovo is a former province of Serbia, which has refused to recognize the country's 2008 declaration of independence. The European Union has overseen years of talks to normalize their ties. Vucic said it was ""a lie"" that Serbia wants to intervene in Kosovo but added that a generation of new Serb ""kids"" living there ""do not consider Kosovo as an independent state and view it as a part of Serbia."" ""We are going to have difficult discussions tomorrow,"" Vucic said. ""We do not agree almost on anything"" with Kurti and the Kosovo leadership. State Department spokesman Ned Price said success of the Brussels talks ""is an absolute priority"" for the U.S. ""We fully support this dialogue."" he told reporters in Washington. ""It´s important, we believe, that both parties use this opportunity to advance their discussions on normalization."" The latest tensions between Serbia and Kosovo soared late last month when Kurti´s government declared that Serbian identity documents and vehicle license plates would no longer be valid on Kosovo territory. Under apparent pressure from the West, Kurti postponed the implementation of the measure for a month, to Sept. 1. Minority Serbs, who live mostly in northern Kosovo, reacted with anger, putting up roadblocks, sounding air raid sirens and firing their guns into the air and in the direction of Kosovo police officers. No one was injured. The Kosovo government accused neighboring Serbia of instigating the riots in order to destabilize the country, which declared independence after a NATO intervention that stopped Serbia´s bloody crackdown against ethnic Albanian separatists in 1999. Kosovo Interior Minister Xhelal Svecla accused Serbia and its ally Russia of triggering and supporting the rioting. ""We see direct involvement of Belgrade, not just in their rhetoric ... but also in direct involvement of groups from Serbia, including their security agencies,"" he told the Associated Press. ""This is inflated and imported from Serbia and Russia, their so-called bigger brother, to incite violence in Kosovo."" Serbian officials accused Kosovo authorities of planning to chase all remaining Serbs out of Kosovo, saying Belgrade will use ""all available means"" to stop the ""pogrom."" As the EU appealed for calm, Vucic visited Serbian army headquarters in Belgrade in what was seen as a thinly veiled warning that all options - including military action - were on the table. There are about 3,800 NATO-led peacekeepers stationed in Kosovo and any military intervention there, Serbian or Russian, would almost certainly create a wider conflict. Russian officials and their propaganda, which are very active in Serbia, were quick to join the pro-Serbian narrative, claiming the Serb minority in Kosovo is being oppressed and subjected to violence by majority ethnic Albanians - the same narrative used as an excuse by Moscow for invading Ukraine. There are fears in the West that Russia could use Serbia to destabilize the Balkans and thus shift at least some attention from its war in Ukraine. Raising the stakes, Russian officials recently started advocating establishing a military base in Serbia, which is surrounded almost entirely by NATO member nations. ""Serbia is militarily neutral and we do not need foreign (military) bases,"" Vucic, who is considered a pro-Russian politician and often praises his friendly ties with Russian President Vladimir Putin, said after his talks with Stoltenberg. Serbia, Russia and China don´t recognize Kosovo´s independence, which is supported by the United States and most other Western states. The EU has said that both Serbia and Kosovo need to normalize their relations if they want to join the 27-nation bloc. ___ AP writer Raf Casert contributed from Brussels.

Paul Griffiths, who oversees the world´s busiest airport for international travel, told The Associated Press that the airport handled 160% more traffic over the past six months compared to the same period last year, part of an air travel rebound around the world. The nearly 28 million people who traveled through the airport over the past six months represent some 70% of the airport´s pre-pandemic levels, even as Dubai´s key source market of China remains closed due to severe pandemic restrictions. Griffiths said he expects the airport's traffic to return to pre-pandemic levels by the end of next year. ""It´s a very, very welcome surge of traffic,"" Griffiths said. The first World Cup in the Middle East, he added, will send foreign soccer fans flocking to Al Maktoum International Airport at Dubai World Central, or DWC. From there, they'll travel daily to Qatar, a tiny neighbor that faces a hotel squeeze. ""We've actually seen a huge amounts of demand at DWC for slot filings for airlines wanting to operate a shuttle service,"" he said. ""I think the city has a lot to offer and a lot to gain from the World Cup.""

Dubai International Airport saw a surge in passengers over the first half of 2022 as pandemic restrictions eased and the upcoming FIFA World Cup in Qatar will further boost traffic to the city-state's second airfield, its chief executive said Wednesday. (AP Photo/Jon Gambrell) Among the airlines buying extra slots to shuttle soccer fans to the tournament from DWC are Qatar Airways, low-cost carrier FlyDubai and budget airline Wizz Air Abu Dhabi, he said. Ambitions plans to turn the airfield in Dubai's southern desert into a mega-aviation hub, first unveiled by Dubai before the 2008 global financial crisis, have sputtered in recent years. Long-haul carrier Emirates, based in Dubai, parked many of its double-decker Airbus A380s there during the pandemic as commercial flights halted. A key East-West transit point, Dubai's air traffic is closely watched as a barometer of the city-state's non-oil economy. Emirates remains the linchpin of the wider empire known as ""Dubai Inc.,"" an interlocking series of government-owned businesses. During the first half of 2022, Dubai International Airport dealt with nearly 56% more flights than the same period in 2021, when contagious coronavirus variants clobbered the industry. Now, in a sign of the health of the industry, Emirates said Wednesday that it would pour billions of dollars into retrofitting much of its Airbus A380 and Boeing 777 fleet. At the height of the pandemic, the airline received a $4 billion government bailout. The widespread lifting of virus restrictions has triggered a rapid increase in air travel demand, filling Dubai´s hub and causing mayhem at airports around the world. While Dubai has not seen the chaotic crowds overwhelming European hubs in recent weeks, Griffiths said the global disruptions have affected its main airport. ""It´s obviously affected growth because some of the caps on capacity that they´ve applied to airports like Heathrow have had an impact on our numbers,"" he said. Last month Emirates lashed out at Heathrow, refusing its request to cap departing passengers and cut flights to the London hub. Emirates later agreed to temporarily limit sales on its flights. Since Moscow's invasion of Ukraine sent Russia´s richest businessmen scrambling to save their assets from what became a widening dragnet, Dubai has welcomed an influx of Russians to its beach-front villas and luxury hotels. The city remains one of the few remaining flight corridors out of Moscow. Griffiths declined to comment on Russians carrying cash out of the country to Dubai, which has become the talk of the town in recent months. But he said the flow of Russian visitors would not stop anytime soon, adding: ""It's still a major source of traffic for us."" ___ Follow Isabel DeBre on Twitter at www.twitter.com/isabeldebre.

Nine Russian warplanes were reported destroyed at an air base in Crimea last week, and an ammunition depot on the peninsula blew up on Tuesday. Ukrainian authorities have stopped short of publicly claiming responsibility, preferring to keep the world guessing, but President Volodymyr Zelenskyy alluded to Ukrainian attacks behind enemy lines after the latest blasts, which Russia blamed on ""sabotage."" Russia seized the Crimean Peninsula from Ukraine in 2014 and has used it as a staging ground for attacks on the country in the war that began Feb. 24. Ukrainian authorities have vowed to recapture Crimea and other occupied territories. ""The invaders will die like dew in the sun,"" Zelenskyy, in his nightly video address Wednesday, said of the effort to retake Crimea and other areas. The explosions represent the latest setback for Moscow, which began its invasion with hopes of taking Kyiv in a lightning offensive but soon became bogged down in the face of fierce resistance. As the war nears the six-month mark, the two sides are engaged in a grinding war of attrition, fighting village to village, largely in the country's east. Smoke rises over the site of explosion at an ammunition storage of Russian army near the village of Mayskoye, Crimea, Tuesday, Aug. 16, 2022. Explosions and fires ripped through an ammunition depot in Russian-occupied Crimea on Tuesday in the second suspected Ukrainian attack on the peninsula in just over a week, forcing the evacuation of more than 3,000 people. (AP Photo) The attacks in Crimea may mark the opening of a new front that would represent a significant escalation in the war and could further stretch Russia's resources. ""Russian commanders will highly likely be increasingly concerned with the apparent deterioration in security across Crimea, which functions as rear base area for the occupation,"" Britain's Defense Ministry wrote on Twitter. As a result of the airfield attacks, Russia is moving dozens of warplanes and helicopters to deeper positions in Crimea and to Russian bases elsewhere, Ukrainian military intelligence reported. Tuesday's explosions ripped through an ammunition site near the town of Dzhankoi, forcing the evacuation of about 3,000 people. Munitions continued to explode Wednesday and authorities fought the fires with a helicopter, said Crimea's regional leader, Sergei Aksyonov. He said a search for the perpetrators was underway. The Kommersant business paper also reported explosions Tuesday at a Crimean base in Gvardeyskoye. There was no confirmation from the Russians. The British intelligence report said Gvardeyskoye and Dzhankoi are home to two of the most important Russian military airfields in Crimea. Just over a week ago, explosions rocked the Russians' Saki air base on Crimea and destroyed planes on the ground. Moscow suggested that the blasts were accidental, caused perhaps by a careless smoker, but Ukrainian authorities mocked that explanation and hinted at their involvement. Last month, a small explosive device carried by a makeshift drone blew up in a courtyard at the headquarters of Russia´s Black Sea Fleet in the Crimean port of Sevastopol, wounding six people and prompting the cancellation of ceremonies there honoring Russia´s navy. In other developments Wednesday, two civilians were reported killed and seven wounded by Russian shelling of several towns and villages in the Donetsk region in the east that is the current focus of the Kremlin offensive. In the south, Russian warplanes fired cruise missiles at the Odesa region overnight, wounding four people, according to regional administration spokesman Oleh Bratchuk. In Mykolaiv, also in the south, two Russian missiles damaged a university building but injured no one. Russian forces also shelled Kharkiv and the surrounding region in the northeast, killing at least six people, wounding at least 16 and damaging residential buildings and civilian infrastructure, authorities said. Meanwhile, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres arrived in the western Ukrainian city of Lviv for a meeting Thursday with Zelenskyy and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. U.N. spokesman Farhan Haq said Guterres will raise the topic of food and grain shipments, nuclear power plant safety and the recent prison explosion that killed scores of captured Ukrainian fighters, and will ""do what he can to essentially lower the temperature as much as possible."" The last time the U.N. chief came to Ukraine, in April, Russia launched a missile strike on Kyiv. ___ Follow the AP´s coverage of the war at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine People help evacuate an elderly man from an area near the site of explosion at an ammunition storage of Russian army near the village of Mayskoye, in Crimea, Tuesday, Aug. 16, 2022.

The double-digit surge in consumer prices over a year earlier was higher than analysts´ central forecast of 9.8% and a jump from the annual rate of 9.4% in June, the Office for National Statistics said Wednesday. The increase was largely due to rising prices for food and staples, including toilet paper and toothbrushes, it said. Most economists believe worse is to come. The Bank of England says soaring natural gas prices are likely to drive consumer price inflation to 13.3% in October. It says that will push Britain into a recession that is expected to last through 2023. Those pressures persuaded the bank to boost its key interest rate by half a percentage point this month, the biggest of six consecutive increases since December. The rate now stands at 1.75%, the highest since the depths of the global financial crisis in late 2008. ""We expect another 50bp (basis points) rate hike in September,"" said James Smith, developed markets economist and ING Economics. ""We wouldn´t rule out another hike in November."" Inflation is surging in many countries as Russia's war in Ukraine has triggered unprecedented increases in energy prices worldwide. Russia has reduced natural gas shipments to Europe in retaliation for the West´s support of Ukraine, creating a crisis for the fossil fuel that powers factories and heats homes in the winter. FILE - A woman selects fruits at a supermarket in London, Wednesday, Nov. 17, 2021. The Office for National Statistics said Wednesday, Aug. 17, 2022, that consumer prices inflation hit double digits, a jump from 9.4% in June and higher than analysts' central forecast of 9.8%. The increase was largely due to rising prices for food and staples including toilet paper and toothbrushes, it said. (AP Photo/Frank Augstein, File) The gas woes are threatening a recession in the 19 countries sharing the euro currency, where inflation hit a record 8.9% in July. The United States has already seen two quarters of economic contraction, intensifying fears of a recession. U.S. inflation eased somewhat to 8.5% in July but is still near a four-decade high. ""I understand that times are tough, and people are worried about increases in prices that countries around the world are facing,"" U.K. Treasury chief Nadhim Zahawi said. ""Although there are no easy solutions, we are helping where we can,"" he said, including with a 400-pound ($483) payment to households facing rocketing energy bills. Britain's Conservative government is under pressure to do even more to help people cope with the cost-of-living crisis. The average U.K. household fuel bill has risen more than 50% this year, and another increase is due in October, when the average bill is forecast to hit 3,500 pounds ($4,300) a year. Prime Minister Boris Johnson is due to leave office next month and says any new measures must be left to his successor. The favorite to replace him, Foreign Secretary Liz Truss, is opposed to major intervention, saying she favors tax cuts over ""handouts."" The other contender, former Treasury chief Rishi Sunak, introduced a 25% windfall tax on oil and gas companies' profits in May that is expected to raise several billion pounds to help fund payments for people with rising utility costs. Opposition politicians want the tax expanded to electricity firms - a move Truss firmly opposes, saying, ""I don´t think profit is a dirty word."""

His 8-year-old daughter ""ran in panic to the basement. It was 2 o´clock in the morning and (she) was really scared,"" said Zhdanov, who later fled the city on the Black Sea and has been living in Kyiv, the capital, for the past three weeks. Kherson, located north of the Crimean Peninsula that was annexed by Moscow in 2014, was the first city to fall after Russia's invasion on Feb. 24. The port remains at the heart of the conflict and Ukraine´s efforts to preserve its vital access to the sea. For Russia, Kherson is a key point along the land corridor from its border to the peninsula. Zhdanov and others who made the hazardous journey to escape from the region describe increasingly grim conditions there, part of a heavy-handed effort by Russia to establish permanent control. The streets in the city, which had a prewar population of about 300,000, are mostly deserted. Rumors swirl about acts of armed resistance and the sudden disappearance of officials who refuse to cooperate with the Russian authorities. Occupation forces patrol in markets to warn those trying to use the Ukrainian currency, the hryvnia, in transactions. Pro-Moscow officials have been installed in local and regional governments, as well as on the police force. Workers at various municipal services face pressure to cooperate with Russian managers. Most schools have closed. FILE - Russian soldiers guard an area as a group of foreign journalists visit in Kherson, Kherson region, south Ukraine, May 20, 2022.

(AP Photo, File) Supplies of essential goods are uneven, halting most commercial activity. There are shortages of medicines and spikes in the price of other commodities. Many residents had been determined to hold out as long as possible for a promised Ukrainian counterattack that hasn't materialized. ""There was physical danger in the city, because there were many soldiers,"" Zhdanov said. A referendum on the region becoming a part of Russia has been announced by Moscow-installed officials, although no date has been set. Meanwhile, officials are pressuring those remaining to take Russian citizenship. Income from Zhdanov's family flower business dried up after the currency change, although he kept growing plants anyway. ""It´s difficult to survive with no money and no food,"" he said. ""Who would want a Russian government if your life, business, and kids´ education are taken away from you? They´ve all gone."" When he left Kherson with his family, Zhdanov risked arrest by hiding a Ukrainian flag in the bottom of his pack. He had kept the flag from a public protest of the Russian troop presence. Journalist Yevhenia Virlych also stayed for five months and kept working, writing about officials who had allegedly cooperated with the Russians. But she worked while in hiding and feared for her safety, frequently changing apartments and posting photos of Poland on social media to give the impression she had already fled. ""They have tied a knot around Kherson and it´s getting tighter,"" Virlych said, adding that locals are being pressured to accept Russian passports. ""Russia, which came under the banner of liberation, but came to torture and take us captive. How can anyone live that way?"" Last month, Virlych finally fled to Kyiv with her husband. Those wanting to leave Kherson must pass a series of Russian military checkpoints. Soldiers search belongings, identity papers and mobile phones, with anyone suspected of supporting the resistance facing interrogation at so-called filtration camps. As Kherson sinks into poverty, it's getting harder to leave. A bus ticket to Zaporizhzhia, a city 300 kilometers (185 miles) to the northeast, now costs the equivalent of $160. Before the war, it was $10. Virlych said she admired the bravery of those who are staying behind as well as of those who risked their lives to join anti-Russian protests in the early stages of the occupation. She recalled a major demonstration on March 5 attended by more than 7,000 people. ""In all my life, I´ve never seen people take such action,"" she said. By April, the protests had stopped as occupying troops began responding to them with lethal force, Virlych added, saying, ""The Russians were opening fire (at crowds) and people were getting wounded."" Moscow wants to maintain its hold on Kherson, which is strategically located near the North Crimean Canal that provides water to the Russian-occupied peninsula. Ukraine had shut down the canal after the annexation eight years ago, but the Russians reopened it after they took control of the region. Like Zhdanov, Virlych is still holding out hope for a Ukrainian counteroffensive to wrest the region away from Russia. ""I believe only in God and the Ukrainian armed forces,"" she said.

North Korea last month became one of the few nations in the world to recognize the independence of Donetsk and Luhansk, another Russian-backed separatist region in eastern Ukraine, prompting Kyiv to cut off diplomatic ties with Pyongyang. There are indications North Korea is reviewing plans to send workers for restoration projects in those regions, which could help its economy but run against U.N. Security Council sanctions over its nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles program. In his comments sent Monday, Donetsk separatist leader Denis Pushilin expressed hope that his Moscow-backed republic and North Korea could achieve ""equally beneficial bilateral cooperation agreeing with the interests"" of their people, the North´s official Korean Central News Agency said Wednesday. Donetsk´s foreign ministry has said its ambassador to Russia, Olga Makeeva, met with North Korean ambassador to Russia Sin Hong Chol in Moscow on July 29 to discuss economic cooperation. According to the ministry, Sin then said there would be ""great potential"" for bilateral cooperation in trade and the ""field of labor migration"" following North Korea´s easing of pandemic border controls. North Korea is reportedly having similar discussions with Luhansk.

The head of Russian proxy forces in eastern Ukraine's Donetsk region has sent a message to Kim calling for cooperation amid signs the North is considering sending laborers for restoration projects in Russian-occupied regions of Ukraine. (Korean Central News Agency/Korea News Service via AP, File) In 2017, Russia backed sanctions imposed by the U.N. Security Council in response to a North Korean long-range missile test that required member states to repatriate all North Korean workers from their territories within 24 months. U.S. State Department spokesperson Ned Price last month criticized Russian suggestions that North Korean workers could be employed for restoration projects in Russian-occupied regions of Ukraine, saying that such arrangements would be ""an affront to the sovereignty of Ukraine."" Price was referring to comments by Russian Ambassador to North Korea Alexander Matsegora, who told the Tass news agency that North Korean construction workers would potentially provide ""very serious help"" in rebuilding the Donbas region. Pushilin´s message to Kim was timed for the Aug. 15 anniversary of the Korean Peninsula´s liberation from Japanese colonial rule at the end of World War II. He congratulated Kim over the anniversary and insisted that the ""people of the Donbas region, too, are fighting to regain their freedom and justice of history today just as the Korean people did 77 years ago,"" KCNA said. The report didn´t say whether Kim sent a message to Pushilin in response. Luhansk and Donetsk together make up the Donbas region, a mostly Russian-speaking region of steel factories, mines and other industries in Ukraine´s east. Separatists have controlled parts of both provinces since 2014, but Russian President Vladimir Putin recognized their independence only shortly before Russia invaded Ukraine in February. Syria is the only other nation that has recognized their independence. North Korea has repeatedly blamed the United States for the crisis in Ukraine, saying the West´s ""hegemonic policy"" justified Russian military actions in Ukraine to protect itself. Kim has also been exploiting a division in the U.N. Security Council that has deepened over Russia´s invasion of Ukraine to accelerate his weapons development as he tries to cement the North as a nuclear power and negotiate a removal of crippling U.S.-led sanctions from a position of strength. North Korea has test-fired more than 30 missiles in 2022 alone, including its first flight test of an intercontinental ballistic missile in nearly five years. There are also indications the North is restoring tunnels at a nuclear testing site that was last active in 2017 in possible preparations to resume nuclear explosive tests."

The 40-year-old Williams fell to 0-2 in matches since announcing ""the countdown has begun"" on her career, losing 6-4, 6-0 to U.S. Open champion Emma Raducanu in the Western & Southern Open on Tuesday night. Williams said last week in a Vogue magazine essay and an Instagram post that her career was winding down, although she did not explicitly say the U.S. Open, which begins Aug. 29 in New York, would be her last tournament. The Cincinnati event was the second U.S. Open tuneup for Williams, and the next time she takes the court will be at Flushing Meadows. She lost to Belinda Bencic in straight sets last week in Toronto. A day before the announcement, Williams beat Nuria Parrizas-Diaz for her first match win since the 2021 French Open. Williams is a 23-time Grand Slam champion, most recently in 2017 at the Australian Open, when she was pregnant with daughter Olympia. She said wanting to expand her family was a big reason she plans to step away. Raducanu, ranked No. 19 in the world, was sharp as she dispatched Williams - and quieted the vocally pro-Williams crowd - in 1 hour, 5 minutes. Serena Williams, of the United States, takes the court for a match against Emma Raducanu, of Britain, during the Western & Southern Open tennis tournament Tuesday, Aug. 16, 2022, in Mason, Ohio. (AP Photo/Aaron Doster) ""I can´t believe I just played Serena Williams,"" the 19-year-old Raducanu said. ""It´s something that I think I´m really fortunate to have been able to do, and for our careers to have crossed when there´s such a big (age) gap and watching her growing up, it was an amazing experience to just play her."" Williams did not speak to reporters after the match. Fans cheered heartily when Williams was introduced, and again when she won her first point on a Raducanu error in the second game. Williams yelled in frustration when she double-faulted and screamed even louder and pumped her fist when she won the third game of the first set. ""I just knew how important every single point was because you let up a little bit, yeah, she´s going to be all over you,"" Raducanu said. ""She´s just such a legend."" Down 2-0 in the first set, she fought back within 4-3 and then 5-4, but Raducanu closed out the set at love. Raducanu rolled from there, with Williams looking frustrated and even resigned near the end. Williams was sidelined for a year by a torn hamstring suffered last year at Wimbledon, and her late-career injuries have contributed to inconsistency on the court. The players thrilled the crowd with an exciting rally in the fifth game of the second set, won by Williams with a forehand volley. But she double-faulted on the next point on the way to being broken. She briskly left the court after the match, waving to the crowd as she exited. ""I think that the crowd was pretty electric,"" Raducanu said. ""The stadium was really packed, and even if they were cheering for Serena ... I was prepared for that."" Raducanu, who faces veteran Victoria Azarenka in Wednesday's second round, has not won a title since her out-of-nowhere triumph at the U.S. Open last year. In the men's draw, top-ranked Daniil Medvedev of Russia advanced to the third round, beating 24th-ranked Botic van de Zandschlup 6-4, 7-5. Medvedev, banned by Wimbledon for his country's invasion of Ukraine, was coming off a second-round loss to Wimbledon finalist Nick Kyrgios last week in Canada. Kyrgios beat Alejandro Davidovich Fokina 7-5, 6-4 on Tuesday. Also Tuesday, four-time Grand Slam champion Naomi Osaka was eliminated by Shuai Zhang, 6-4, 7-5. The tournament lost another big name, Coco Gauff, when she retired from her match against qualifier Marie Bouzkova with a left ankle injury. Gauff had her ankle taped after the first set and dropped out after the first game of the second set. Karolina Pliskova advanced with a 7-5, 6-1 win over Williams' older sister, Venus. Bencic fell to Sorana Cirstea, 6-2, 6-7 (3), 6-4. Rafael Nadal, sidelined since withdrawing from Wimbledon with an abdominal tear, practiced before a large crowd.

Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan have accepted an invition from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to meet Thursday to review the deal allowing Ukrainian grain to be shipped to world markets to help alleviate the global grain crisis and discuss ways to end the six-month-old war. U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric told reporters Tuesday that he has no doubt the three leaders will also discuss the situation at the Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, where Russia and Ukraine have accused each other of shelling. Dujarric said they also will likely talk about a U.N. fact-finding mission to investigate the killings at the Olenivka prison in a separatist region of eastern Ukraine that the warring nations accuse each other of carrying out. He said he expects ""the need for a political solution"" to the war to be raised during the meeting in the western city of Lviv, not far from the Polish border. It comes after the signing of an international agreement in Istanbul on July 22 clearing the way for Ukraine to export 22 million tons of corn and other grain stuck at its Black Sea ports and in silos since Russia invaded the country on Feb. 14. A separate memorandum between Russia and the U.N. signed the same day was aimed at clearing roadblocks to its shipments of food and fertilizer to world markets. Erdogan´s office confirmed that he leader will be in Lviv on Thursday to meet with Zelenskyy and Guterres to discuss the grain deal as well as ways to end the war through diplomatic means. The Brave Commander bulk carrier makes its way from the Pivdennyi Seaport near Odesa, Ukraine, Tuesday, Aug. 16, 2022.

(AP Photo/Nina Lyashonok) Guterres first proposed the grain deal to Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukraine´s Zelenskyy at separate meetings in Moscow and Kyiv in late April. The U.N.´s Dujarric said the secretary-general´s trip to Ukraine is ""a chance for him just to see first-hand the results of an initiative ... that is so critically important to hundreds of millions of people."" After the three-way meeting, and likely bilateral talks between Erdogan and Guterres, the U.N. chief will travel to Odesa, one of the three Ukrainian ports now operating to ship grain, on Friday, Dujarric said. He will then travel to Istanbul on Saturday to visit the center coordinating the Black Sea shipping, which includes the four parties to the deal -- Ukraine, Russia, Turkey and the United Nations. Russia was not invited by Zelenskyy to the meeting in Lviv. Dujarric said the secretary-general had ""a very good conversation"" Monday with Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu, which touched on the grain shipments from both Ukraine and Russia. During the phone call, Guterres and Shoigu also discussed ""the conditions for the safety operations of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant"" and a fact-finding mission to the Olenivka prison, Dujarric said. The war and a halt to all Ukrainian grain shipments and most Russian shipments of grain and fertilizer added significantly to the global food crisis because both countries are major suppliers to world markets. Developing countries have been especially hard-hit by supply shortages and high prices. Even though ships are now leaving Russia and Ukraine and some prices have dropped, the food crisis has not ended. ___ Associated Press writer Suzan Fraser in Ankara, Turkey, contributed to this report."

The tough statement comes amid tensions between Russia and the West over Moscow's action in Ukraine. The ministry said that Britain has sent a notice informing about a planned flight of an RC-135 reconnaissance plane along a route that partly passes over Russian territory. ""We regard this action as a deliberate provocation,"" the ministry said, adding that the Russian air force has been ""given the task to prevent the violation of the Russian border."" ""All possible consequences of this deliberate provocation will lie entirely with the British side,"" the ministry said in a statement, without specifying when and where the British flight was planned.

Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon called on the world Tuesday to honor civilians who were killed when Russian ground forces tried to invade Ukraine's capital and eventually retreated from the area surrounding Kyiv. Ban, a former South Korean diplomat who served as secretary-general between 2007 and 2016, visited Bucha, a city northwest of the Ukrainian capital where hundreds of civilians were found dead after the Russian withdrawal in late March. ""It´s hard to express my feelings. It´s a horrendous atrocity. It´s a crime against humanity and (those responsible) should be held accountable,"" Ban told The Associated Press after visiting the Church of St. Andrew the Apostle. Authorities said 116 bodies were found in a mass grave near the church after Russian soldiers pulled out. ""All the people killed here without any reason should be fully honored and remembered in the history of humankind,"" Ban said. He traveled to Ukraine as part of an international peace initiative known as The Elders, which former South African President Nelson Mandela founded in 2007. Former U.N.

(AP Photo/Evgeniy Maloletka) Ban was joined by former Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos, who is a Nobel Peace Prize laureate like the late Mandela. Santos also described the massacre of Ukrainian civilians as a crime against humanity. ""The whole world should be very much aware of what is happening and be in a position to support the Ukrainian people in their effort to gain their peace and freedom,"" Santos told the AP. The two former leaders visited the site of the mass grave behind the church and visited a display of photographs inside the building with scenes from the aftermath of the intense fighting in Bucha in late February and March. The civilian killings at Bucha have become a symbol of brutality of the war. They were carried out as Russia launched a failed effort to capture the Ukrainian capital after it invaded the country on Feb. 24. Municipal authorities say 458 bodies have been found in the Bucha area since the city's 33-day Russian occupation ended. The victims include 12 children, who in most cases were killed with their parents. ___ Vasilisa Stepanenko contributed to this report. ___ Follow the AP´s coverage of the war at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine Former U.N.

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-11116173/Satellite-images-ship-Ukraine-Syria.html,2022-08-16,Satellite images show first ship out of Ukraine in Syria,"The first shipment of grain to leave Ukraine under a wartime deal appears to have ended up in Syria - even as Damascus remains a close ally of Moscow, satellite images analyzed Tuesday by The Associated Press show. The arrival of the cargo ship Razoni in Syria comes after the government in Kyiv praised the ship´s initial departure from the port of Odesa as a sign that Ukraine could safely ship out its barley, corn, sunflower oil and wheat to a hungry world where global food prices have spiked in part due to the war. But its arrival in Syria's port of Tartus shows how complicated and murky international trade and shipping can be. Syria has already received Ukrainian grain taken from Russian-occupied territory amid Moscow´s war on Kyiv. Images from Planet Labs PBC analyzed by the AP showed the Sierra Leone-flagged Razoni at port just before 11 a.m. Monday. The vessel was just next to the port's grain silos, key to supplying wheat to the nation. Data from the Razoni's Automatic Identification System tracker shows it had been turned off since Friday, when it was just off the coast of Cyprus, according to ship-tracking website MarineTraffic.com. Ships are supposed to keep their AIS trackers on, but vessels wanting to hide their movements often turn theirs off. Those heading to Syrian ports routinely do so. The Razoni could be identified in the satellite image by its color, length and width, as well as the four large white cranes on its deck. Samir Madani, co-founder of the oil-shipment website TankerTrackers.com and an expert on following ships via satellite images, similarly identified the vessel from the image. This satellite image from Planet Labs PBC shows the Sierra Leone-flagged cargo ship Razoni, center bottom with four white cranes on its red deck, at port in Tartus, Syria, Monday, Aug. 15, 2022. The first shipment of grain to leave Ukraine under a wartime deal has ended up in Syria, even as that country remains a close ally of Moscow, satellite images analyzed Tuesday by The Associated Press show. (Planet Labs PBC via AP) The Financial Times first reported on the satellite image. The Razoni, loaded with 26,000 tons of corn, left Odesa on Aug. 1. The cargo ship was the first to leave a Ukrainian-controlled port in the country since Russia launched the war in February. As part of the deal, a United Nations coordination center in Istanbul staffed by Turkey, Russia and Ukraine oversees the shipments to make sure they safely travel through the Black Sea, which has mines in some areas and has seen combat during the conflict. But Lebanon, which was Razoni's presumed destination, ended up not taking the shipment, even as it struggles with its own economic crisis. Lebanese media had reported that after a monthslong delay due to the war in Ukraine, the merchant who had bought the shipment no longer wanted it. The vessel sat off Mersin, Turkey, before heading to Syria. Asked about the Razoni, the U.N. Joint Coordination Center said in a statement that ""after outbound vessels clear inspection in Istanbul, the JCC ceases monitoring them."" ""The cleared vessels proceed then to their final destinations, whatever those may be,"" the center said. On Tuesday, the Ukrainian Embassy in Beirut referred to an earlier statement that Razoni's cargo was no longer Kyiv's responsibility. ""Our task has been to reopen seaports for grain cargo and it has been done,"" the statement said. In Washington, State Department spokesperson Ned Price similarly said that America didn't ""determine who buys the grain shipments or their final destinations."" ""What matters most to us are a couple things,"" Price said. ""One: That Ukraine is appropriately compensated for the grain, the foodstuff, for the crops that it is in this case providing. And that the food gets to where it is needed most."" An official reached by telephone Tuesday at the Tartus port declined to comment. Syria's mission to the United Nations did not respond to a request for comment. Tartus, on the Mediterranean Sea, lies about 320 kilometers (200 miles) northwest of Syria's capital, Damascus. Syria remains sanctioned by the West over killing and abuses of civilians during the civil war, though food supplies have been exempted by the West. Russian military support has been key to Syrian President Bashar Assad remaining in power. Syria has recognized the Russian-backed breakaway eastern Ukrainian regions of Donetsk and Luhansk as sovereign entities, leading to Kyiv severing diplomatic ties with Damascus. Since earlier this year, ships have carried Ukrainian foodstuffs from Russian-occupied territory to Syria. In May, satellite images showed the Russian-flagged Matros Pozynich at dockside in Latakia, Syria. Ukraine said the ship had 27,000 tons of grain Russia stole from it and initially tried to sell to Egypt, which refused to take the cargo. ___ Associated Press writers Kareem Chehayeb in Beirut and Matthew Lee in Washington contributed to this report."

After two years of remote meetings amid pandemic restrictions, more than half of Indonesia´s Parliament was in attendance as President Joko Widodo told them and top officials on the eve of Independence Day that regional tensions are threatening security. ""We must always remain vigilant, cautious and alert,"" Widodo said. ""Crisis after crisis still haunts the world."" He noted that when war broke out in Ukraine causing energy and food crises, the world was still grappling with the health and economic impacts of COVID-19. Some countries are predicted to go bankrupt, while over 550 million people face extreme poverty and 345 million others face food shortages and famine, Widodo said. ""The challenges are not easy for the world and for Indonesia. We must face those challenges with prudence and vigilance,"" he said. Russia's war in Ukraine has exacerbated rising prices in Indonesia amid ongoing supply chain disruptions from the pandemic, causing cooking oil prices to soar while the interruptions in wheat, soybeans and corn have affected the cost of several foods. Indonesian President Joko Widodo gestures as he delivers his annual State of the Nation Address ahead of the country's Independence Day, at the parliament building in Jakarta, Indonesia, Tuesday, Aug. 16, 2022. (Bagus Indahono/Pool Photo via AP) In April, Indonesia banned all exports of crude palm oil, a key ingredient in cooking oils, for a month amid a series of student protests against skyrocketing food prices. Indonesia and Malaysia are the world´s largest exporters of palm oil, accounting for 85% of global production. As the host of the Group of 20 richest and biggest economies this year, Indonesia has sought to bridge divisions between members over Russia´s invasion. Widodo has been guarded in his comments about the war in Ukraine in an attempt to remain neutral. Widodo was the first Asian leader to visit the warring countries. Ukraine is not a G-20 member, but Widodo has invited Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to the November summit along with Russian President Vladimir Putin, hoping to appease all sides and limit any distractions from the forum´s agenda. Zelenskyy has said he won´t attend if the war is continuing then and has opted to follow the discussions by video link. The inflation rate in Indonesia has been relatively modest with the shock being mostly absorbed through a budget bolstered by energy subsidies. Widodo said the state budget recorded a surplus of 106 trillion rupiah ($7.2 billion), allowing the government to provide fuel, gas and electricity subsidies of 502 trillion rupiah ($34 billion) this year to cushion fuel prices. However, he said the administration must recalculate its energy subsidies to reduce the burden on the budget. Southeast Asia´s largest economy served as a key exporter of coal, palm oil and minerals amid a global shortage in commodities after Russia´s invasion of Ukraine. Coal exports increased to record levels in March after a brief ban on its shipments early this year to secure domestic supplies.

Addressing a security conference attended by military officials from Africa,, Asia and Latin America, Putin reaffirmed his long-held claim that he sent troops into Ukraine in response to Washington turning the country into an ""anti-Russia"" bulwark. ""They need conflicts to retain their hegemony,"" Putin charged. ""That´s why they have turned the Ukrainian people into cannon fodder. The situation in Ukraine shows that the United States is trying to drag the conflict out, and it acts in exactly the same way trying to fuel conflicts in Asia, Africa and Latin America."" The speech represented the latest attempt by the Russian leader to rally support amid bruising Western sanctions that targeted the Russian economy and finance along with its government structures, top officials and businesses for Moscow´s action in Ukraine. Putin also drew parallels between the U.S. backing Ukraine and a recent visit to Taiwan by U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, charging that both were part of an alleged American attempt to foment global instability. ""The American adventure in Taiwan wasn't just a trip by an irresponsible politician.

""The era of the unipolar world order is nearing its end,"" he added.

Crews removed a replica of a T-34 tank that sat atop the monument outside the city of Narva in Estonia's Russian-speaking east and placed it on a truck that took it to the Estonian War Museum in Viimsi, a town north of the capital, Tallinn. The monument commemorates the Soviet soldiers who died fighting Nazi Germany during World War II. Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas said a neutral grave marker would replace the tank replica and the memorial outside Narva would ""remain a dignified site for commemorating the dead."" Estonia, which shares a nearly 300-kilometer (180-mile) border with Russia, has taken a hard-line stance against Russia´s invasion of Ukraine. The prime minister said that removing symbols like the tank was necessary to protect public order and to prevent Moscow from sowing discord in Estonia, a country with a significant ethnic Russian minority. ""No one wants to see our militant and hostile neighbor foment tensions in our home,"" Kallas said. ""We will not afford Russia the opportunity to use the past to disturb the peace in Estonia."" Cranes unload a Soviet T-34 tank which was installed as a monument in Narva from a trailer at a military museum in Tallinn, Estonia, Tuesday, Aug. 16, 2022. Estonia's government said Tuesday it has decided to remove a Soviet monument in the border town of Narva, sitting in the Baltic country's Russian-speaking part, with the prime minister saying the reason for the dismantling is that it represents a risk for public order. (AP Photo/Sergei Grits) Like its Baltic neighbors, Estonia has removed many monuments glorifying the Soviet Union or communist leaders since the country regained independence in 1991. In 2007, the relocation of a World War II monument of a Red Army soldier in Tallinn sparked days of rioting. The government and many Estonians saw the Tallinn monument as a painful reminder of five decades of Soviet occupation, while some ethnic Russians viewed its move as an attempt to erase their history. After the city council in Narva decided the replica tank should go, a crowd gathered around the monument to protest the plan. A total of seven Soviet-era monuments in Narva are slated for removal, the government said Tuesday. The city, whose 57,500 inhabitants are chiefly Russian speakers, is about 210 kilometers (130 miles) east of Tallinn and separated from the Russian town of Ivangorod by the Narva river. Russian officials have criticized Estonia's drive to remove remaining Soviet-era monuments. ""We find this outrageous. A war with a common history, getting rid of monuments for those who saved Europe from fascism, of course, is outrageous. This does not make any nation look good, including Estonia,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said earlier this month. Earlier this month, Estonia decided to bar people from neighboring Russia with tourist visas from entering the northernmost Baltic country as a consequence of the war in Ukraine. The European Union, of which Estonia is a member, already has banned air travel from Russia after Moscow invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24. But Russians can still travel by land to Estonia and apparently take flights to other European destinations. ___ Follow the AP´s coverage of the war at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine Police officers stand next to a trailer transporting a Soviet T-34 tank which was installed as a monument in Narva, arrived to a military museum in Tallinn, Estonia, Tuesday, Aug. 16, 2022.

Russia blamed the blasts in the village of Mayskoye on an ""act of sabotage,"" without naming the perpetrators. Separately, the Russian business newspaper Kommersant quoted residents as saying plumes of black smoke also rose over an air base in Crimea´s Gvardeyskoye. Ukraine stopped short of publicly claiming responsibility for any of the blasts, including those that destroyed nine Russian planes at another Crimean air base last week. Russia seized the Crimean Peninsula in 2014 and has used it to launch attacks against Ukraine in the war that began nearly six months ago. If Ukrainian forces were behind the explosions, that would represent a significant escalation in the war. Such attacks could also indicate that Ukrainian operatives are able to penetrate deeply into Russian-occupied territory. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy alluded to Ukrainian attacks behind enemy lines when he included individuals ""who oppose the occupiers in their rear"" in a list of people he thanked for supporting the country's war effort. Smoke rises over the site of explosion at an ammunition storage of Russian army near the village of Mayskoye, Crimea, Tuesday, Aug. 16, 2022. Explosions and fires ripped through an ammunition depot in Russian-occupied Crimea on Tuesday in the second suspected Ukrainian attack on the peninsula in just over a week, forcing the evacuation of more than 3,000 people. (AP Photo) In a video address Tuesday night, he also warned people not go near Russian military installations and storage sites for ammunition and equipment. In another reported act of sabotage, Russia´s Tass news service quoted the FSB security agency as saying Ukrainian operatives blew up six high-voltage transmission towers earlier this month in Russia's Kursk region, close to Ukraine. The Kremlin has demanded that Kyiv recognize Crimea as part of Russia as a condition for ending the fighting, while Ukraine has vowed to drive Moscow's forces from the peninsula on the Black Sea. Videos posted on social media showed thick columns of smoke rising over raging flames in Mayskoye, and a series of explosions could be heard. The Russian Defense Ministry said a power plant, electrical lines, railroad tracks and apartment buildings were damaged. ""We came out to take a look and saw clouds of smoke coming from the cowshed where the military warehouses are,"" said resident Maksim Moldovskiy. ""We stayed there until about 7-8 a.m. Everything was exploding - flashes, fragments, debris falling on us. Then the emergency guys came and said they were evacuating everybody."" Crimea´s regional leader, Sergei Aksyonov, said two people were injured and more than 3,000 evacuated from two villages. ""The detonations are rather strong. Ammunition is strewn all over the ground,"" he said, adding that several homes burned down. In what may have been retaliation for the attacks in Crimea, Russian warplanes fired missiles at a military airfield in Zhytomyr, 87 miles (140 kilometers) west of Kyiv, damaging a runway and vehicles, Ukrainian officials reported. Crimea is a popular summer destination for Russian tourists, and last week's explosions at Crimea's Saki air base sent sunbathers on beaches fleeing as flames and pillars of smoke rose over the horizon. Ukrainian officials warned Tuesday that Crimea would not be spared the ravages of war. Rather than a travel destination, ""Crimea occupied by Russians is about warehouse explosions and a high risk of death for invaders and thieves,"" Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak said on Twitter. Russia blamed last week's explosions on an accidental detonation of munitions, but satellite photos and other evidence - including the dispersed blast sites - pointed to a Ukrainian attack, perhaps with anti-ship missiles, military analysts said. Britain´s Defense Ministry said in an intelligence update that vessels in Russia´s Black Sea Fleet are in an ""extremely defensive posture"" in the waters off Crimea, with ships barely venturing out of sight of the coastline. Russia´s flagship Moskva went down in the Black Sea in April, and last month Ukrainian forces retook strategic Snake Island. The Russian fleet´s ""limited effectiveness undermines Russia´s overall invasion strategy,"" the British said. ""This means Ukraine can divert resources to press Russian ground forces elsewhere."" Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu charged that in addition to supplying arms to Ukraine, Western allies have provided detailed intelligence and instructors to help Ukraine operate weapons that can hit deep in occupied territory. ""Western intelligence agencies not only have provided target coordinates for launching strikes, but Western specialists also have overseen the input of those data into weapons systems,"" Shoigu said. In other developments: - A U.N.-chartered ship loaded with Ukrainian grain set out for the hunger-stricken Horn of Africa in the first such relief delivery of the war. The shipment was made possible by an internationally brokered deal to free up grain trapped in Ukrainian ports by the fighting and establish safe corridors through the mined water of the Black Sea. - U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres plans to travel to Ukraine for a meeting Thursday in the western city of Lviv with Zelenskyy and Turkey´s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. They are expected to discuss the grain shipments and a possible fact-finding mission to the Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, which Russia and Ukraine have accused each other of shelling. Guterres will also visit Odesa on Friday. During Guterres´ last trip to Ukraine, in April, Russia forces launched an airstrike on Kyiv while he was visiting the capital. - Samantha Power, head of the U.S. Agency for International Development, said the United States is giving more than $68 million in additional funding to the U.N. World Food Program ""to purchase, move, and store up to 150,000 metric tons of Ukrainian wheat to help respond to the global food crisis."" - Russian shelling killed at least two civilians in the industrial Donbas region in the east and in the city of Kharkiv in the northeast, Ukrainian authorities said. ___ Associated Press writer Edith M.

More quietly, a parallel wartime deal met Moscow´s demands to clear the way for its wheat to get to the world, too, boosting an industry vital to Russia´s economy that had been ensnared in wider sanctions. While the U.S. and its European allies work to crush Russia's finances with a web of penalties for invading Ukraine, they have avoided directly sanctioning grains and other goods that feed people worldwide. Russian and Ukrainian wheat, barley, corn and sunflower oil are important to countries in Asia, Africa and the Middle East, where millions rely on subsidized bread for survival. As the war spiked food and energy prices, millions of people have been pushed into poverty or closer to the brink of starvation. Two deals that the U.N. and Turkey brokered last month to unblock food supplies depend on each other: one protects ships exporting Ukrainian grain through the Black Sea and the other assures Russia that its food and fertilizer won't face sanctions, safeguarding one of the pillars of its economy and helping ease concerns from insurers and banks. The agreement allowed a Western shipper to move two vessels of grain out of Russia in a matter of weeks. It used to take months because Western banks refused to transfer payments to Russia. Although U.S. and European Union sanctions don´t directly target Russian agriculture, Western banks have been wary of running afoul, hindering buyers' and shippers' access to Russian grain. ""You have to invest time with the banks to make them understand this whole thing because the authority says, `Go ahead there´s no sanction,´ but the banks self-sanction,"" said Gaurav Srivastava, whose company Harvest Commodities buys, ships and sells grains from the Black Sea region. A harvester collects wheat in Semikarakorsky District of Rostov-on-Don region near Semikarakorsk, Southern Russia, Wednesday, July 6, 2022. Russia is the world's biggest exporter of wheat, accounting for almost a fifth of global shipments. It is expected to have one of its best ever crop seasons this year. Agriculture is among the most important industries in Russia, accounting for around 4% of its GDP, according to the World Bank. (AP Photo) He called the process with banks a ""labor intensive exercise."" What´s changed in recent weeks, Srivastava said, is ""the appearance ... of this being sort of a truce between all parties."" The deal mattered to Russia because it's the world´s biggest exporter of wheat, accounting for almost a fifth of global shipments, and the country is expected to have one of its best-ever crop seasons this year. Agriculture accounts for around 4% of Russia's gross domestic product, according to the World Bank. ""What is more important is employment,"" said Russian economist Sergey Aleksashenko, referring to jobs created by agriculture. ""It's like 7 to 8% of employment."" Farming provides 5-6 million Russian jobs, with some regions almost entirely dependent on it for their livelihood, he said. Srivastava, whose company operates from Los Angeles and Geneva, hopes to be able to ship out 10-15 million tons of Russian grain over the coming year. He also has been able to move out two chartered ships that were stuck at Ukrainian ports since the start of the war on Feb. 24. He said the company is aiming to pick up 1 million tons of grain from Ukraine under the four-month-long U.N. deal. ""We are a commercial business, but we are trying to help the plight of farmers in both Russia and Ukraine,"" Srivastava said. ""I´m very optimistic, especially in the last couple of weeks."" Russia´s demands for the deal included public statements from the U.S. and EU that sanctions don't target Russian food and fertilizer. It also raised issues around financial transactions to the Russian Agricultural Bank, access for Russian-flagged vessels at ports and ammonia exports needed for fertilizer production. A week before Russia signed the agreement, the U.S. Treasury Department issued statements with such assurances. It made clear that Washington hadn't imposed sanctions on the sale or transport of agricultural commodities or medicine from Russia. Treasury also issued a broad license to authorize certain transactions related to agricultural commodities, saying the U.S. ""strongly supports efforts by the United Nations to bring both Ukrainian and Russian grain to world markets and to reduce the impact of Russia´s unprovoked war on Ukraine on global food supplies and prices."" The EU also reiterated that Russian agriculture hadn't been sanctioned and blamed the global spike in food prices on the war and the Kremlin's agricultural export caps meant to protect its domestic market. The 27-nation bloc said its sanctions provide exceptions, such as allowing EU countries to authorize access to ports for Russian-flagged vessels for trade in agricultural or food products. Russia says it's still facing challenges. The country's agriculture ministry says difficulty with the supply of imported farming equipment, which isn't directly sanctioned, also threatens the grain harvest. It said domestic needs would be met, but that exports might be affected. Even after the deal was signed, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov chided Western assurances that agriculture was exempt from sanctions. During a diplomatic tour of Africa focused on food exports, he said a ""half-truth is worse than a lie"" while pointing to the chilling effect of sanctions. U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres ""committed himself to press the Western countries to lift those restrictions,"" Lavrov said. ""We´ll see whether he can succeed."" Meanwhile, Russian and Ukrainian grains are ever more critical to averting hunger in developing countries. S&P Global Commodity Insights said in a June report that 41 million tons of Russian wheat could be available for export this year. But overall, the world is expected to produce 12.2 million tons less wheat and 19 million tons less corn for the 2022-2023 harvest compared with the previous year, International Grains Council Executive Director Arnaud Petit said. This is in part due to the war in Ukraine and drought in Europe, he said. While a strong U.S. dollar and inflation may force some countries to ration food imports, Petit noted that some countries are imposing export controls that could impact the availability of grains in sub-Saharan Africa and the Middle East. ___ Raf Casert contributed to this report from Brussels. ___ Follow the AP´s coverage of the war at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine FILE - A security officer stands next to the ship Navi-Star which sits full of grain since Russia's invasion of Ukraine began five months ago as it waits to sail from the Odesa Sea Port, in Odesa, Ukraine, July 29, 2022.

The allies´ summertime drills, named Ulchi Freedom Shield, will take place from Aug. 22 to Sept. 1 in South Korea and include field exercises involving aircraft, warships, tanks and potentially tens of thousands of troops. The drills underscore Washington and Seoul´s commitment to restore large-scale training after they canceled some of their regular drills and downsized others to computer simulations in recent years to create space for diplomacy with North Korea and because of COVID-19 concerns. The U.S. Department of Defense also said the U.S., South Korean and Japanese navies took part in missile warning and ballistic missile search and tracking exercises off the coast of Hawaii from Aug. 8 to 14, which it said were aimed at furthering three-way cooperation in the face of North Korean challenges. While the United States and South Korea describe their exercises as defensive, Ulchi Freedom Shield will almost surely draw an angry reaction from North Korea, which describes all allied training as invasion rehearsals and has used them to justify its nuclear weapons and missiles development. China, North Korea´s main ally, expressed concern over the expansion of U.S. military exercises with its Asian allies, saying they could worsen tensions with the North. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin didn´t offer a specific answer when asked whether Beijing believes the trilateral drills in Hawaii were in some way directed at China. FILE - In this photo provided by South Korea Defense Ministry, a missile is fired during a joint training between U.S. and South Korea at an undisclosed location in South Korea, on May 25, 2022. The United States and South Korea will begin their biggest combined military training in years, starting Aug. 22, in the face of an increasingly aggressive North Korea, which has been ramping up weapons tests and threats of nuclear conflict against Seoul and Washington, the South's military said Tuesday, Aug. 16. (South Korea Defense Ministry via AP, File) ""North Korea has repeatedly expressed its concern"" over the joint drills, Wang said in a briefing in Beijing on Tuesday. ""The negative impact of the military exercises on the situation on the Korean Peninsula is worth paying attention to. All parties should act prudently and stop any actions that may increase tension and confrontation and damage the mutual trust,"" he said. Before being shelved or downsized, the U.S. and South Korea held major joint exercises every spring and summer in South Korea. The spring ones had been highlighted by live-fire drills involving a broad range of land, air and sea assets and usually involved around 10,000 American and 200,000 Korean troops. Tens of thousands of allied troops participated in the summertime drills, which mainly consisted of computer simulations to hone joint decision making and planning, although South Korea´s military has emphasized the revival of large-scale field training this time. Officials at Seoul´s Defense Ministry and its Joint Chiefs of Staff did not comment on the number of U.S. and South Korean troops that will participate in Ulchi Freedom Shield. The drills, which will kick off along with a four-day South Korean civil defense training program led by government employees, will reportedly include exercises simulating joint attacks, front-line reinforcements of arms and fuel, and removals of weapons of mass destruction. The allies will also train for drone attacks and other new developments in warfare shown during Russia´s war on Ukraine and practice joint military-civilian responses to attacks on seaports, airports and major industrial facilities such as semiconductor factories. ""The biggest meaning of (Ulchi Freedom Shield) is that it normalizes the South Korea-U.S. combined exercises and field training, (contributing) to the rebuilding of the South Korea-U.S. alliance and the combined defense posture,"" Moon Hong-sik, a Defense Ministry spokesperson, said during a briefing. Some experts say North Korea may use the drills as an excuse to increase tensions. North Korea has already warned of ""deadly"" retaliation against South Korea over its own COVID-19 outbreak, which it dubiously claims was caused by anti-North Korean propaganda leaflets and other objects flown across the border by balloons launched by southern activists. There are concerns that the North Korean threat, issued last week by the powerful sister of leader Kim Jong Un, portends a provocation which might include a nuclear or missile test or even border skirmishes. In an interview with Associated Press Television last month, Choe Jin, deputy director of a think tank run by North Korea's Foreign Ministry, said the United States and South Korea would face ""unprecedented"" security challenges if they don´t drop their hostile military pressure campaign against North Korea, including joint military drills. Kim Jun-rak, spokesperson of South Korea´s Joint Chiefs of Staff, said the South Korean and U.S. militaries are maintaining a close watch on North Korean military activities and facilities. Animosity has increased on the Korean Peninsula since U.S.-North Korea nuclear negotiations derailed in early 2019 because of differences over a relaxation of crippling U.S.-led sanctions on North Korea in exchange for disarmament steps. Kim Jong Un has since declared North Korea will bolster its nuclear deterrent in the face of ""gangster-like"" U.S. pressure and halted all cooperation with South Korea. Exploiting a division in the U.N. Security Council over Russia´s war on Ukraine, North Korea has dialed up its weapons testing to a record pace this year, conducting more than 30 ballistic launches. They included the country´s first intercontinental ballistic missiles since 2017 and tests of tactical systems designed to be armed with small battlefield nuclear weapons. Kim has punctuated the testing binge with repeated warnings that North Korea will proactively use its nuclear weapons in conflicts with South Korea and the United States, which experts say indicate an escalation in its nuclear doctrine that could cause greater concern for its neighbors. South Korea and U.S. officials say North Korea has been gearing up for its first nuclear test since September 2017, when it claimed to have developed a thermonuclear warhead to fit on its ICBMs. FILE - Protesters wearing masks of U.S. President Joe Biden, left, and South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol stage a rally to oppose planned joint military exercises, called the Ulchi Freedom Shield, between South Korea and the United States on the occasion of U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi's visit in South Korea, in front of the presidential office in Seoul, South Korea Aug. 4, 2022.

Zakhar was a civil engineer. Now they are soldiers, training to liberate Ukraine from Russia's invasion - but doing it more than 1,000 miles (1,600 kilometers) away in Britain. They are among several hundred Ukrainian recruits pounding through an intense form of infantry training at an army base in southeast England. One batch of the 10,000 Ukrainian soldiers that the British military has pledged to train within 120 days, they are spending several weeks learning skills including marksmanship, battlefield first aid and -- crucially for their country's future - urban warfare. As the Ukrainians practice house-clearing amid the rattle of gunfire and pall from smoke grenades on a mock-townscape where British soldiers once trained for operations in Northern Ireland, they think about driving Russian troops from the streets of their own cities.. ""The most important part is urban training, because it´s the most dangerous combat, in cities,"" said Serhiy, who like the other Ukrainians did not want his full named used because of security concerns. ""The British instructors have a lot of experience, from Iraq, Afghanistan. We can adapt all this knowledge to the Ukrainian situation and use it to liberate our country from Russian invasion."" British trainers are putting the Ukrainian troops through a condensed version of the British Army´s infantry training, covering weapons handling, first aid, patrol tactics and the law of conflict. The aim is to turn raw recruits into battle-ready soldiers in a matter of weeks. The first batch arrived last month and have already been sent back to replenish depleted Ukrainian units. ""We are running a basic infantry course, which takes Ukrainian recruits and teaches them to shoot well, to move and communicate well within any tactical environment, and to medicate well,"" said Maj. Craig Hutton, a Scots Guards officer helping to oversee the training.

They have a fantastic will to learn, and they just want to practice, practice and practice more."" More than 1,000 U.K. personnel are involved in the training mission, taking place at four bases around the U.K. Other countries are also sending trainers, including Canada, the Netherlands, New Zealand and the Nordic nations.

I left my brothers and sisters, my relatives, to gain knowledge and experience that will help me ... free our territory from occupiers and invaders,"" he said through an interpreter. Serhiy, the onetime IT worker, has been in uniform for less than a month and is equally determined. ""I know that Ukrainian soldiers are dying to protect our homes right now. So it´s hard to know that I am not with them,"" he said. ""But the Ukrainian army needs only professional soldiers, so I am ready to train as hard as possible to be ready for the battle ahead."" Brigadier Justin Stenhouse, who is in charge of the training as commander of the 11th Security Assistance Brigade, said seeing the motivation of the Ukrainians is ""humbling."" But he acknowledged that preparing for the chaos of urban combat is ""almost impossible to do in training."" The goal of the mission, he said, is to ""train them so they can adapt to survive in those early weeks of combat.""

The Sierra Leone-flagged ship Razoni, which left Odesa on Aug. 1, and moved through the Black Sea carrying Ukrainian corn, later passed inspection in Turkey. It was initially heading for Lebanon with 26,000 metric tons of corn for chicken feed. The corn´s buyer in Lebanon later refused to accept the cargo, since it was delivered much later than agreed. The Razoni hasn´t had its tracker on for the last three days and it appeared off the east coast of the Mediterranean island of Cyprus at last transmission. It was not clear if the Razoni had its tracker off because it was heading to a port in Syria, a strong ally of Russia that Ukraine had accused of importing grain stolen from Ukraine. Syria is also under Western sanctions because of the 11-year conflict there that has killed hundreds of thousands. Syrian port officials could not be immediately reached for comment. ""Our task has been to reopen seaports for grain cargo and it has been done,"" Ukraine´s embassy in Beirut said in a statement in English, adding that to date, 16 vessels have left Ukraine carrying more than 450,000 tons of agricultural products since a breakthrough agreement was brokered by Turkey and the United Nations with Russia and Ukraine.

""We don´t have any information about (the) position of the vessel and cargo destination,"" it said. ""We have also information that cargo has been resold a few times after that."" The embassy said: ""We are not responsible for (the) vessel and cargo, especially when it left Ukraine, moreover after vessel´s departure from foreign port."" The Black Sea region is dubbed the world´s breadbasket, with Ukraine and Russia key global suppliers of wheat, corn, barley and sunflower oil that millions of impoverished people in Africa, the Middle East and parts of Asia rely on for survival. An estimated 20 million tons of grain - most of it said to be destined for livestock - has been stuck in Ukraine since the start of the 6-month-old war.

The Scandinavian country´s statistics agency on Monday said Norwegian exports reached 229 billion kroner ($24 billion) last month, 0.4% higher than the previous record set in March this year. Norway´s trade surplus of 153.2 billion kroner ($15.8 billion) also was the highest on record. Norway, a major producer of offshore oil and gas, has seen energy exports surge as European countries scramble to find alternatives to Russian energy in response to Moscow's invasion of Ukraine. Since the invasion, the EU has approved bans on Russian coal and most oil to take effect later this year, but it did not include Russian natural gas because the 27-nation bloc depends on gas to power factories, generate electricity and heat homes. However, Russian President Vladimir Putin has weaponized gas exports to pressure the bloc into reducing its sanctions over the war in Ukraine or to push other political aims. The EU has been left scrambling to fill gas storage ahead of winter, when demand rises and utility companies draw down their reserves to keep homes warm and power plants running.

At a one-day meeting of the five Nordic leaders in Oslo, Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said: ""We must phase out Russian gas as soon as possible."" She said Europe is ""facing a challenging fall."" Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre said the Nordic countries also should focus on renewable energies, including wind and solar.

In its regular Facebook update, the military's general staff said Russian troops had attempted to push towards Kramatorsk, one of two major cities in the eastern Donetsk province that remain under Ukrainian control, but ""they failed completely and chaotically retreated to their previous positions."" In the same post, the military said Russian forces had staged an unsuccessful assault on Bakhmut, a strategic town in the Donetsk region whose capture would pave the way for Russia to take Kramatorsk and the de facto Ukrainian administrative capital, Sloviansk. The Donetsk region is one of two provinces that make up the Donbas, where the fighting has largely been focused in recent months, since Kremlin forces retreated from around the capital, Kyiv. Russian officials announced the full capture of the Luhansk region, the second of the two, early last month, though its Ukrainian governor has repeatedly claimed that Kyiv´s forces are holding out in a small area near the regional boundary. In the same update, the military claimed that Russia had tried and failed to break through Ukrainian defense lines in the northern Kharkiv region, home to Ukraine´s second-largest city, but were ""met harshly and thrown back."" A man cleans an apartment destroyed after Russian shelling in Nikopol, Ukraine, Monday, Aug. 15, 2022. (AP Photo/Kostiantyn Liberov) Meanwhile, the Russian FSB, the KGB´s main successor agency, said that it had thwarted a ""sabotage and terrorist attack"" on an oil pipeline in Russia´s southern Volgograd region, which it blamed on two Russian citizens colluding with Ukrainian security forces. The claims could not be immediately verified. Elsewhere, Russian and Ukrainian officials traded more accusations Monday about renewed shelling of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, with each side alleging that the other was responsible for the attacks that have raised fears of a catastrophe. The press office of the Kremlin-backed administration in Enerhodar, the Russian-controlled city where the plant is located, told the Interfax agency that Ukrainian forces were carrying out ""massive shelling"" of the facility, as well as Enerhodar´s residential and industrial areas. According to the statement, the shelling came from nearby Nikopol, a Ukrainian-held city which faces the plant across the Dnieper River. The mayor of Nikopol later said that Russians were shelling Enerhodar themselves. Mayor Yevhen Yevtushenko and other municipal authorities in Nikopol have repeatedly accused Russian troops stationed at the plant of shelling the city, knowing that Ukrainian forces there were unlikely to fire back. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy renewed his call for fresh sanctions against Moscow and its nuclear industry in response to the situation. He described Russian forces´ actions there as ""nuclear blackmail"" that may embolden malign actors worldwide. As Russian forces kept up their artillery barrages around Ukraine, at least three Ukrainian civilians were killed and 20 others wounded, Ukrainian officials said. The deaths and 13 of the wounded were blamed on Russian shelling that hit towns and villages in the Donetsk region, regional officials said. In the country´s second-largest city of Kharkiv, seven civilians were wounded by Russian shelling that hit residential buildings and an area near a bus stop. Kharkiv Gov. Oleh Synyehubov said the wounded included a 80-year-old woman. Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Lt. Gen. Igor Konashenkov said Monday that Russian warplanes have struck Ukrainian army positions in the southern Kherson region and in the Donetsk region. He added that the Russian air force also hit a facility in the Kharkiv region, killing at least 100 and wounding 50 ""mercenaries"" from Poland and Germany. His claims could not be independently verified. Speaking at the opening of an arms show outside Moscow, Russian President Vladimir Putin hailed the military, which he said was ""liberating the Donbas step by step."" He also vowed to expand arms sales to Russian allies, whom he praised for continuing to offer firm support to Moscow in the face of Western pressure. For its part, the Ukrainian military claimed to have destroyed more than 10 Russian warehouses with ammunition and military equipment in the past week. In other developments Monday: - Lawyers for American basketball star Brittney Griner filed an appeal against her nine-year Russian prison sentence for drug possession, Russian news agencies reported. Griner, a center for the Phoenix Mercury and a two-time Olympic gold medalist, was convicted on Aug. 4. She was arrested in February at Moscow´s Sheremetyevo Airport after vape canisters containing cannabis oil were found in her luggage. - The Ukrainian parliament extended martial law and the country's general mobilization for another 90 days. - Zelenskyy dismissed the heads of three regional branches of Ukraine´s top security agency, SBU, in the Kyiv, Lviv and Tarnopil regions. Zelenskyy´s office didn´t elaborate on the reasons behind the move. Last month, he dismissed SBU chief Ivan Bakanov and a chief prosecutor, saying their departments had too many people who faced accusations of collaborating with the Russians. - The trial of five European men captured in eastern Ukraine got underway in a court administered by Kremlin-backed separatists, Russian media reported. Three of the five - a Swede, a Croat and a Briton - could face the death penalty over charges of serving as mercenaries and ""undergoing training in order to seize power"" under the laws of the self-proclaimed, unrecognized Donetsk People´s Republic, Russian state media reported. The remaining two, both British, face prison terms. - A British military reconnaissance plane violated Russia´s airspace, the Russian defense ministry said. The ministry said in a statement that Russian air defense forces in Russia´s Arctic northwest had spotted the plane heading towards the border from the direction of the Barents Sea. A Russian fighter identified the aircraft as a British Air Force RC-135 and forced it out of Russian territory, the ministry said. - German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said Berlin would not back several fellow European countries that have called for an EU-wide move to stop issuing tourist visas to Russian citizens. The nations backing such a ban say that Russians should not be able to take vacations in Europe while Moscow wages war in Ukraine. Finland and Denmark want an EU decision and some EU countries bordering Russia already no longer issue visas to Russians. ""This is not the war of the Russian people. It is (Russian President Vladimir) Putin´s war and we have to be very clear on that topic,"" Scholz said. ___ Follow the AP´s coverage of the war at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine American actor Liev Schreiber stands in front of a house which have been destroyed by Russia bombardment in Borodianka, near Kyiv, Ukraine, on Monday, Aug. 15, 2022.

Police said that the nine bomb threats also targeted shopping centers, hospitals and medical facilities. Monday´s threats follow more than 40 similar incidents that plagued the small non-European Union nation in July, more than half of them targeting Chisinau airport and causing severe service disruptions. None of the scores of recent threats in Moldova, which shares a border with war-torn Ukraine, have turned out to be true. No explosives have been discovered and no one has yet been charged. Airport security, however, has been bolstered. Moldovan Prime Minister Natalia Gavrilita said in a recent interview with Radio Moldova that some of the threats had been traced to I.P. addresses in Russia and Belarus but that they could have been manipulated. She added that requests were made to those countries to investigate. ""It is very clear that these alerts are meant to slow our vigilance, keep us busy, (and) test our reaction,"" she added. In April, tensions in Moldova soared after a series of explosions in Transnistria - a Russia-backed separatist region of Moldova where Russia bases about 1,500 troops - raised fears that it could get dragged into Russia´s war in Ukraine. Transnistria has a population of about 470,000 and has been under the control of separatist authorities since a civil war in 1992. Moldova, although constitutionally neutral and thus not a potential NATO member, was granted European Union candidate status in late June. But full membership to the 27-nation bloc will be a long road contingent on a series of reforms such as tackling corruption, organized crime, strengthening human rights and the rule of law. ___ McGrath contributed from Sighisoara, Romania."

The court said the date is ""provisional"" and that reading the verdict will likely take half a day. The marathon trial opened on March 9, 2020, at a top-security courtroom near Amsterdam's Schiphol, the airport the doomed Kuala Lumpur-bound flight set off from on July 17, 2014. It was shot down over war-torn eastern Ukraine hours later, killing all 298 passengers and crew. An international team of investigators and prosecutors named four suspects in the downing: Russians Igor Girkin, Sergey Dubinskiy and Oleg Pulatov as well as Ukrainian Leonid Kharchenko. They are charged with murdering all those who died. None of the suspects has been arrested or sent to the Netherlands, so their trial went ahead in their absence. Only Pulatov is represented by a team of defense lawyers, who say he insists he is innocent. Prosecutors in December urged the judges to sentence all four men to life imprisonment. The trial is being held in the Netherlands because about two-thirds of those killed were Dutch. Prosecutors say the Buk missile system that destroyed the Boeing 777 was transported into Ukraine from the Russian 53rd Anti-Aircraft Missile Brigade´s base in Kursk, and after a missile was fired the launching system was then returned to Russia. Russia has denied involvement in the downing of the plane. ""The crew of the Telar pressed the button, but according to the indictment it was Girkin, Dubinskiy, Pulatov and Kharchenko who directed the employment of this weapon in order to serve their own interests,"" prosecutor Ward Ferdinandusse told judges as the trial opened."

An association of gas pipeline operators on Monday set the level at 2.4 euro cents per kilowatt hour under legislation passed by the German parliament, which had an expected range of 1 to 5 cents. The tax on gas that is used to heat homes in winter and generate electricity is set to take effect in October and run through the beginning of April. It will not show up in utility bills until November or December. Vice Chancellor Robert Habeck has said the tax will mean added costs of several hundred euros per year for an average household. The government is seeking ways to soften the blow through financial assistance for poorer households and a proposed break on value-added tax. Chancellor Olaf Scholz tweeted Monday that ""we will leave no one behind"" amid the higher costs. The gas tax will raise money to compensate importers of Russian gas whose contracts with city utilities do not permit them to pass on the costs of surging natural gas prices. Russia has sharply cut back supplies of natural gas that costs less under long-term contracts, forcing importers to purchase much more expensive gas on the spot market to fulfill their obligations. The government has agreed to bail out the largest importer, Uniper. Habeck said that 12 importers have applied for help and would receive 34 billion euros ($34.7 billion), or about 90% of their exceptional costs, the dpa news agency reported. He said Monday that the choice was not between a tax and no tax: ""The alternative would have been the collapse of the German energy market.""

(AP Photo/Michal Dyjuk) President Andrzej Duda in a speech recalled how Soviet commanders at the time were sure of victory, drawing a obvious parallel to Russian assumptions when it launched it full-scale war on Ukraine on Feb. 24. ""For 74 years of its existence, Soviet Russia lost only one official war, and it was that war 102 years ago,"" he said. Duda accused Russia breaking a taboo in force since World War II which held that nations do not attack sovereign nations seeking to deprive them of their territory or independence. Among those attending the ceremonies was 94-year-old Zbigniew Kruszewski, a veteran of the 1944 Warsaw Uprising against Nazi German occupiers. At that time Soviet forces, stood by as the Germans slaughtered Poles. ""We didn't get help, we were abandoned,"" Kruszewski, who now lives in Texas, told the AP, saying he hopes the presence of U.S. troops means Poland would not be abandoned again. Polish Defense Minister Mariusz Blaszczak ahead of the ceremony told reporters: ""Years pass, but one thing is constant - when Russia tries to rebuild its empire, it is always an evil empire. It always commits war crimes."" Polish troops from the different branches of the armed forces paraded down a street lined with fluttering white-and-red national Polish flags, and Duda promoted new generals. The military held picnics seeking to recruit volunteers into the armed forces amid a new sense of threat fueled by Russia's invasion of Ukraine. American troops have taken part before in the Aug. 15 celebration before but it is the first one since President Joe Biden announced at a NATO summit in late June that Washington was establishing its first permanent U.S. military presence in Poland - something Poland has long sought. The newly named Camp Kosciuszko in Poznan, western Poland, is a shared Polish-U.S. base that becomes the permanent headquarters in Poland for the U.S. Army´s V Corps, and the easternmost U.S. Army base in Europe. Many of the American troops there, however, still serve on a rotational basis. The base is named after Gen. Tadeusz Kosciuszko, a hero of the American Revolution who strengthened the fortifications of West Point, and who later returned to Poland to fight imperial Russian forces. Maj. Kevin Andersen, a U.S. Army public affairs officer, said that troops are having trouble saying the name Kosciuszko (roughly pronounced koh-SHOOSH´-koh) and many have been calling it ""Camp K"" instead. He said the army has created a video helping the soldiers to learn to say it as a gesture of respect to Poland as it welcomes the Americans. ""For now it´s a lot of Camp K., but we´re really trying to convince the soldiers to pronounce the full Camp Kosciuszko,"" he said. Gen.

Griner, an eight-time all-star center with the WNBA´s Phoenix Mercury and two-time Olympic gold medalist, was convicted Aug. 4 after police said they found vape canisters containing cannabis oil in her luggage at Moscow´s Sheremetyevo Airport. Griner admitted that she had the canisters in her luggage, but said she had inadvertently packed them in haste and that she had no criminal intent. Her defense team presented written statements that she had been prescribed cannabis to treat pain. Her February arrest came at a time of heightened tensions between Moscow and Washington, just days before Russia sent troops into Ukraine. At the time, Griner, recognized as one of the greatest players in WNBA history, was returning to Russia, where she plays during the U.S. league´s offseason. Lawyer Maria Blagovolina was quoted by Russian news agencies on Monday as saying the appeal was filed, as was expected, but the grounds for it weren't immediately clear. The nine-year sentence was close to the maximum of 10 years, and Blagovolina and co-counsel Alexander Boykov said after the conviction that the punishment was excessive. They said that in similar cases defendants have received an average sentence of about five years, with about a third of them granted parole.

She was arrested in February at Moscow's Sheremetyevo Airport after vape canisters containing cannabis oil were found in her luggage. (Evgenia Novozhenina/Pool Photo via AP, File) Before her conviction, the U.S. State Department declared Griner to be ""wrongfully detained"" - a charge that Russia has sharply rejected. Reflecting the growing pressure on the Biden administration to do more to bring Griner home, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken took the unusual step of revealing publicly in July that Washington had made a ""substantial proposal"" to get Griner home, along with Paul Whelan, an American serving a 16-year sentence in Russia for espionage. Blinken didn't elaborate, but The Associated Press and other news organizations have reported that Washington has offered to free Viktor Bout, a Russian arms dealer who is serving a 25-year sentence in the U.S. and once earned the nickname the ""Merchant of Death."" On Sunday, a senior Russian diplomat said talks about an exchange have been conducted. ""This quite sensitive issue of the swap of convicted Russian and U.S. citizens is being discussed through the channels defined by our presidents,"" Alexander Darchiev, head of the Foreign Ministry´s North America department, told state news agency Tass. ""These individuals are, indeed, being discussed. The Russian side has long been seeking the release of Viktor Bout.

Then-President Rodrigo Duterte approved the cancellation of the signed deal to buy 16 Russian Mi-17 helicopters due to concerns over possible Western sanctions, which could hamper fast bank transfers of the income Filipino workers send home from the U.S. and other Western countries, Ambassador Jose Romualdez said. Romualdez said Washington did not pressure the Philippines to drop the 12.7-billion-peso ($227 million) deal with the Russians. But following Russia´s invasion of Ukraine in February, countries that would purchase Russian equipment could face Western sanctions, he said. ""I think it was really prudent specially for President Duterte to approve the cancellation of that contract because it can save us a lot of trouble,"" Romualdez told an online news conference organized by Manila-based foreign correspondents. The U.S. offer to sell Boeing CH-47 Chinooks was discussed as early as last year by former Philippine Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana and his American counterpart, Lloyd Austin, in Washington even before Duterte was persuaded by key Cabinet members to cancel the deal, Romualdez said.

(AP Photo/Andrew Harnik, Pool, FILE) One of Duterte´s Cabinet members, Finance Secretary Sonny Dominguez, warned Duterte then that Western countries may withhold assistance that could help the Philippines deal with and recover from coronavirus outbreaks, two Philippine officials told The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because of a lack of authority to discuss the issue publicly. Lorenzana first confirmed the cancellation of the contract to secure Russia´s helicopters in an interview with AP last month. After serving as defense chief under Duterte, Lorenzana has been appointed by new President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. to head a government agency in charge of transforming former military bases into business hubs. Romualdez said the Philippine government under Duterte made an initial payment of about $38 million to secure the Russian military transport helicopters and he would recommend Marcos Jr. and his top defense and foreign officials try to ask the Russians to provide other weapons or equipment that would be covered by that downpayment. ""Definitely we will not just simply say goodbye to that money,"" Romualdez said. ""It´s still a big amount as far as we´re concerned."" A Filipino military official has said the helicopter deal would undergo a ""termination process"" after the Philippine decision to cancel it was made since a contract has already been signed. The Russians can appeal but there is little room for the Philippine government to reconsider, said the official. Under the scrapped helicopter purchase agreement, which was signed in November, the first batch of the multi-purpose helicopters would have been scheduled for delivery by Russia´s Sovtechnoexport in about two years. Aside from the 16 helicopters, one unit should have been given for free to the Philippines, defense officials said. The Russian-made helicopters could have been used for combat, search and rescue operations, and medical evacuations in the Southeast Asian archipelago, which is often lashed by typhoons and other natural disasters, Philippine officials said. In March, the Philippines voted ""yes"" on a U.N. General Assembly resolution that demanded an immediate halt to Moscow´s attack on Ukraine and the withdrawal of all Russian troops. Duterte has expressed concern over the global impact of the Russian invasion but has not personally condemned it. When he was in office, he nurtured close ties with Russian President Vladimir Putin, whom he once called his ""idol,"" and Chinese leader Xi Jinping while frequently criticizing U.S. security policies. The Philippines is a treaty ally of Washington, which has imposed heavy sanctions on Moscow aimed at pressuring it to pull back from Ukraine. Due to financial constraints, the Philippines has struggled for years to modernize its military, one of the most underfunded in Asia, to deal with decades-long Muslim and communist insurgencies and to defend its territories in the disputed South China Sea."

Anastasiia´s retreat into digital technology to cope with the isolation and stress of war that rages on the front line just seven miles (12 kilometers) away is increasingly common among young people in Ukraine´s embattled Donetsk region.

(AP Photo/David Goldman) More than 6 million Ukrainians, overwhelmingly women and children, have fled the country and millions more are internally displaced, according to the U.N. refugee agency. The mass displacement has upended countless childhoods, not only for those having to start a new life after seeking safety elsewhere, but also for the thousands who stayed behind. In the industrial city of Kramatorsk, seven miles (12 kilometers) south of Sloviansk, the friendship between 19-year-old Roman Kovalenko and 18-year-old Oleksandr Pruzhyna has become closer as all of their other friends have left the city. The two teenagers walk together through the mostly deserted city, sitting to talk on park benches. Both described being cut off from the social lives they enjoyed before the war. ""It's a completely different feeling when you go outside. There is almost no one on the streets, I have the feeling of being in an apocalypse,"" said Pruzhyna, who lost his job at a barber shop after the invasion and now spends most of his time at home playing computer games. ""I feel like everything I was going to do became impossible, everything collapsed in an instant."" Of the roughly 275,000 children age 17 or younger in the Donetsk region before Russia´s invasion, just 40,000 remain, the province´s regional governor Pavlo Kyrylenko told The Associated Press last week. According to official figures, 361 children have been killed in Ukraine since Russia launched its war on Feb. 24, and 711 others have been injured. Authorities are urging all remaining families in Donetsk, but especially those with children, to evacuate immediately as Russian forces continue to bombard civilian areas as they press for control of the region. A special police force has been tasked with individually contacting households with children and urging them to flee to safer areas, Kyrylenko said. ""As a father, I feel that children should not be in the Donetsk region,"" he said. ""This is an active war zone."" In Kramatorsk, 16-year-old Sofia Mariia Bondar spends most days sitting in the shoe section of a clothing shop where her mother works. A pianist and singer who wants to study art at university after she finishes her final year of high school, Sofia Mariia said there is ""nowhere to go and nothing to do"" now that her friends have left. ""I wish I could go back in time and make everything like it was before. I understand that most of my friends who left will never come back, no matter what happens in the future,"" she said. ""Of course it´s very sad that I can´t have all the fun like other teenagers do, but I can´t do anything about it, only cope with it."" Her mother, Viktoriia, said that since the city has mostly emptied out, she manages to sell only one or two items per week. But with the danger of shelling and soldiers plying the streets, her daughter is no longer allowed to go out alone and spends most of her time by her mother's side in the store or at their home on the outskirts of Kramatorsk where the threat of rocket strikes is lower. ""I keep her near me all the time so that in case something happens, at least we will be together,"" she said. Of the roughly 18,000 school-age children in Kramatorsk before Russia´s invasion, only around 3,200 remain, including 600 preschoolers, said the city´s head of military administration, Oleksandr Goncharenko. While officials continue to push residents to evacuate and provide information on transportation and accommodation, ""parents cannot be forced to leave with their children,"" Goncharenko said. When the school semester begins on Sept. 1, he said lessons will be offered online for those who stay. In Kramatorsk´s verdant but nearly empty Pushkin Park, Rodion Kucherian, 14, performed tricks on his scooter on an otherwise deserted set of ramps, quarter pipes and grind rails. Before the war, he said, he and his friends would do tricks in the bustling park alongside many other children. But now his only connection to his friends - who have fled to countries like Poland and Germany - is on social media. He´s taken up other solitary activities just to keep himself busy, he said. ""It´s very sad not to see my friends. I haven´t seen my best friend for more than four months,"" he said. ""I started cycling at home so I don't miss them as much."" In Sloviansk, 12-year-old Anastasiia said she can´t remember the last time she played with someone her own age, but she's made some new friends through the games she plays online. ""It´s not the same. It´s way better to go outside to play with your friends than just talking online,"" she said. Her best friend, Yeva, used to live on her street, but has evacuated with her family to Lviv in western Ukraine.

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-11111925/S-Korea-offers-North-economic-benefits-denuclearization.html,2022-08-15,S Korea offers North economic benefits for denuclearization,"South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol offered ""audacious"" economic assistance to North Korea on Monday if it abandons its nuclear weapons program, while avoiding harsh criticism of the North days after it threatened ""deadly"" retaliation over a COVID-19 outbreak it blames on the South. In a speech celebrating the end of Japan´s colonization of the Korean Peninsula, Yoon also called for better ties with Japan, calling the two countries partners in navigating challenges to freedom and saying their shared values will help them overcome historical grievances linked to Japan´s brutal colonial rule before the end of World War II. Yoon´s televised speech on the liberation holiday came days after North Korea claimed a widely disputed victory over COVID-19 but also blamed South Korea for the outbreak. North Korea insists leaflets and other objects flown across the border by activists spread the virus, an unscientific claim Seoul describes as ""ridiculous."" North Korea has a history of dialing up pressure on South Korea when it doesn´t get what it wants from the United States, and there are concerns that North Korea´s threat portends a provocation, which could possibly be a nuclear or missile test or even border skirmishes. Some experts say North Korea may stir up tensions around joint military exercises the United States and South Korea start next week. Yoon, a conservative who took office in May, said North Korea´s denuclearization is key for peace in the region and the world. If North Korea halts its nuclear weapons development and genuinely commits to a process of denuclearization, South Korea will respond with huge economic rewards that would be provided in phases, Yoon said. Kim Tae-hyo, Yoon´s deputy national security director, said Seoul is willing to provide economic rewards at each step of a phased denuclearization process if North Korea commits to a denuclearization ""roadmap"" and proceeds with the ""freezing, declaration, verification and dismantlement"" of its nuclear weapons program. South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol waves a national flag during a ceremony to celebrate Korean Liberation Day from Japanese colonial rule in 1945, at the presidential office square in Seoul, South Korea, Monday, Aug. 15, 2022. (AP Photo/Ahn Young-joon, Pool) Yoon´s proposal isn't meaningfully different from previous South Korean offers that have already been rejected by North Korea, which has been accelerating its efforts to expand its nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles programs, seen by leader Kim Jong Un as his strongest guarantee of survival. ""We will implement a large-scale program to provide food, providing assistance for establishing infrastructure for the production, transmission and distribution of electrical power, and carry out projects to modernize ports and airports to facilitate trade,"" Yoon said. ""We will also help improve North Korea´s agricultural production, provide assistance to modernize its hospitals and medical infrastructure, and carry out initiatives to allow for international investment and financial support,"" he added, insisting that such programs would ""significantly"" improve North Korean lives. Inter-Korean ties have deteriorated amid a stalemate in larger nuclear negotiations between North Korea and the U.S. which derailed in early 2019 because of disagreements over a relaxation of crippling U.S.-led sanctions on the North in exchange for disarmament steps. North Korea has ramped up its missile testing activity in 2022, launching more than 30 ballistic missiles so far, including its first intercontinental ballistic missiles since 2017. Experts say Kim is intent on exploiting a favorable environment to push forward his weapons program while the U.N. Security Council is divided and effectively paralyzed over Russia´s war on Ukraine. North Korea´s unusually fast pace in weapons tests also underscores its brinkmanship aimed at forcing Washington to accept the North as a nuclear power and at negotiating badly needed economic benefits and security concessions from a position of strength, experts say. The U.S. and South Korean governments have also said North Korea is gearing up to conduct its first nuclear test since September 2017, when it claimed to have detonated a nuclear warhead designed for its ICBMs. In the face of the growing North Korean threats, Yoon has vowed to bolster South Korea´s defense in conjunction with its alliance with the United States and also strengthen security ties with Japan, which also is alarmed by the North´s nuclear and missile programs. South Korea´s relations with Japan declined to post-World War II lows over the past several years as the countries allowed their grievances over history to extend to other areas including trade and military cooperation. While Yoon has called for future-oriented cooperation with Japan, history may continue to pose an obstacle to relations. The countries have struggled to negotiate a solution after Japanese companies rejected South Korean court rulings in recent years to compensate South Koreans who were subject to wartime industrial slavery, an issue that could cause a further diplomatic rupture if it results in the forced sales of the companies´ South Korean assets. Even as Yoon called for improved relations with Japan, his Foreign Ministry issued a statement expressing ""deep disappointment and regret"" after three members of Japan's Cabinet visited and prayed at Yasukuni Shrine, which honors Japanese war dead, including some convicted war criminals. The shrine is seen in South Korea as a symbol of Japanese militarism. ""In the past, we had to unshackle ourselves from Imperial Japan´s political control and defend our freedom. Today, Japan is our partner as we face common threats that challenge the freedom of global citizens,"" Yoon said. ""When South Korea and Japan move toward a common future and when the mission of our times align, based on our shared universal values, it will also help us solve the historical problems that exist between our two countries."" While Washington has said it will push for additional sanctions if North Korea conducts another nuclear test, the prospects for meaningful punitive measures are unclear. China and Russia recently vetoed U.S.-sponsored resolutions in the U.N. Security Council that would have increased sanctions on the North over its ballistic missile testing this year. North Korea´s state media said Monday that Kim exchanged messages with Russian President Vladimir Putin and celebrated their strengthening ties. Kim said the countries´ relations were forged by Soviet contributions to Japan´s World War II defeat and that they were strengthening their ""strategic and tactical cooperation and support and solidarity"" in the face of enemies´ military threats. Putin said closer ties between the countries would help bring stability to the region, the North´s official Korean Central News Agency said. North Korea has repeatedly blamed the United States for the crisis in Ukraine, saying the West´s ""hegemonic policy"" justified Russian military actions in Ukraine to protect itself.

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-11111815/US-Congress-members-meet-Taiwan-leader-amid-China-anger.html,2022-08-15,China announces new drills as US delegation visits Taiwan,"China announced more military drills around Taiwan as the self-governing island´s president met with members of a new U.S. congressional delegation on Monday, threatening to renew tensions between Beijing and Washington after a similar recent visit by U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi angered China. Pelosi was the highest-level member of the U.S. government to visit Taiwan in 25 years, and her trip prompted nearly two weeks of threatening military exercises by China, which claims the island as its own. In those drills, Beijing fired missiles over the island and into the Taiwan Strait and sent warplanes and navy ships across the waterway´s midline, which has long been a buffer between the sides that split amid civil war in 1949. China accuses the U.S. of encouraging the island's independence through the sale of weapons and engagement between U.S. politicians and the island´s government. Washington says it does not support independence, has no formal diplomatic ties with the island and maintains that the two sides should settle their dispute peacefully - but it is legally bound to ensure the island can defend itself against any attack. American and Taiwanese officials have accused China of using Pelosi's visit as a pretext for intimidating moves, and a senior U.S. official said recently that Washington would continue to deepen its ties with Taiwan in the coming days and weeks. The latest trip began Sunday with little notice ahead of time - and drew more ire from China. The delegation was due to leave late Monday. ""China will take resolute and strong measures to defend national sovereignty and territorial integrity,"" Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said at a daily briefing Monday, after Beijing announced new drills in the seas and skies surrounding Taiwan. ""A handful of U.S. politicians, in collusion with the separatist forces of Taiwan independence, are trying to challenge the one-China principle, which is out of their depth and doomed to failure."" In this photo released by the Taiwan Presidential Office, Taiwan's President Tsai Ing-wen pose for photos with U.S. Congress members and other Taiwan officials during a meeting at the Presidential Office in Taipei, Taiwan on Monday, Aug. 15, 2022. The delegation of U.S. Congress members visited Taiwan parliament on Monday in a further sign of support among American lawmakers for the self-governing island. (Taiwan Presidential Office via AP) The new exercises were intended to be ""resolute response and solemn deterrent against collusion and provocation between the U.S. and Taiwan,"" the Defense Ministry said earlier. It was not clear if the new drills had already started since the ministry gave no details about where and when they would be conducted, in contrast to previous rounds. The U.S. lawmakers, led by Democratic Sen. Ed Markey of Massachusetts, met with President Tsai Ing-wen, Foreign Minister Joseph Wu and legislators, according to the American Institute in Taiwan, Washington´s de facto embassy on the island. At their meeting, Tsai said her administration was working with allies to ensure stability in the Taiwan Strait and maintain the status quo - a reference to the island's self-governance, separate from Beijing. ""Russia´s invasion of Ukraine earlier this year has shown the threat that authoritarian nations pose to the global order,"" Tsai said. Markey responded by saying Washington and Taipei had a ""moral obligation to do everything we can to prevent an unnecessary conflict and Taiwan has demonstrated incredible restraint and discretion during challenging times."" The senator also highlighted legislation intended to boost political and economic ties with Taiwan, especially in the critical semiconductor industry. Taiwan is a crucial provider of computer chips for the global economy, including China´s high-tech sectors, and beyond the geopolitical risks of rising tensions in the region, an extended crisis in the Taiwan Strait could have major implications for international supply chains at a time when the world is already facing disruptions and uncertainty. Markey is one of the few members of Congress still serving who voted for the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act that ensured continued relations with the island following the switch of U.S. diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing. The other members of the delegation are Republican Rep. Aumua Amata Coleman Radewagen, a delegate from American Samoa, and Democrats John Garamendi and Alan Lowenthal from California and Don Beyer from Virginia. In a statement from his Senate office, Markey cited the 1979 law in saying the U.S. must maintain its commitment to ""help Taiwan withstand cross-Strait coercion"" and avoid conflict. China says it wants to use peaceful means to bring Taiwan under its control, but its recent saber rattling has emphasized its threat to take the island by military force. The earlier drills appeared to be a rehearsal of a blockade or attack on Taiwan that would force the cancellation of commercial flights and disrupt shipping to Taiwan's main ports as well as cargo passing through the Taiwan Strait, one of the world's busiest shipping lanes. The exercises prompted Taiwan to put its military on alert, but were met largely with defiance or apathy among the public used to living in China´s shadow. The American ""visit at this time is of great significance, because the Chinese military exercise is (intended) to deter U.S. congressmen from visiting Taiwan,"" Lo Chih-cheng, the chair of the Taiwan legislature´s Foreign and National Defense Committee, said after meeting with the U.S. lawmakers. ""Their visit this time proves that China cannot stop politicians from any country to visit Taiwan, and it also conveys an important message that the American people stand with the Taiwanese people,"" Lo said. A senior White House official on Asia policy said last week that China had used Pelosi´s visit as an excuse to launch an intensified pressure campaign against Taiwan. ""China has overreacted, and its actions continue to be provocative, destabilizing, and unprecedented,"" Kurt Campbell, a deputy assistant to U.S. President Joe Biden, said on a call with reporters on Friday. Campbell said the U.S. would send warships and planes through the Taiwan Strait in the next few weeks and is developing a roadmap for trade talks with Taiwan that he said the U.S. intends to announce in the coming days.

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-11110583/China-threat-emerges-elections-UK-Australia.html,2022-08-14,'China threat' emerges in elections from UK to Australia,"It's not just the economy. While inflation and recession fears weigh heavily on the minds of voters, another issue is popping up in political campaigns from the U.K. and Australia to the U.S. and beyond: the ""China threat."" The two finalists vying to become Britain's next prime minister, Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak, clashed in a televised debate last month over who would be toughest on China. It's a stark departure from outgoing Prime Minister Boris Johnson´s business-focused ""Sinophile"" approach and part of a hardening of anti-China rhetoric in many Western countries and other democracies, like Japan, that is coming out in election campaigns. Nations for years have sought to balance promoting trade and investment with the world´s second-largest economy with concerns about China´s projection of military power, espionage and its human rights record. The pendulum is swinging toward the latter, as evidenced in U.S., European, Japanese and Australian opposition to the threatening Chinese military drills that followed U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's visit to Taiwan last week, and growing warnings from Western intelligence agencies about Beijing's snooping and interference. A delegation of U.S. lawmakers arrived Sunday in Taiwan to discuss reducing tensions in the Taiwan Strait and investments in semiconductors, among other topics.

(Danny Lawson/PA via AP, File) That shift has made China a target for vote-seeking politicians as opinion polls show public sentiment in many democracies turning against China. Some candidates blame China for economic woes at home in addition to posing a security threat to its neighbors and the wider world. China loomed large in Australia's election in May in which the conservatives, who ultimately lost, tried to paint the opposition as being unwilling to stand up to Beijing. America´s growing rival on the global stage is also expected to figure in this fall's U.S. congressional races, particularly in Midwest industrial states, long after former President Donald Trump embraced a fierce anti-China posture. Many in Europe are also rebalancing their approach to China, though that did not figure significantly in elections in France this year and in Germany in 2021. Andreas Fulda, a University of Nottingham political scientist specializing in China, said British politicians ""are more clear-eyed about China"" than their European neighbors. ""The U.K. has paid close attention to what´s happening in Australia, and in many ways the debate here is well ahead of mainland Europe,"" he said. Truss, the British foreign secretary and the front-runner in the Conservative Party's leadership race, has spoken of expanding what she calls a ""network of liberty"" so democracies can counter China and Russia more effectively. She says she will crack down on Chinese tech companies such as the owner of TikTok, the short-video platform. In her role as Britain's top diplomat, Truss has strongly criticized China's military moves after Pelosi's Taiwan visit, accusing Beijing of an ""aggressive and wide-ranging escalation"" that ""threaten(s) peace and stability in the region."" Sunak, Britain's former Treasury chief, has pledged to shutter the partially Chinese-funded Confucius Institutes that promote Chinese culture and language at U.K. universities, lead an international alliance against Chinese cyberthreats, and help British companies and universities counter Chinese spying. ""I had a sense of déjà vu having just moved over from Australia,"" said Ben Bland, director of the Asia-Pacific program at London's Chatham House think tank, who previously worked at the Lowy Institute in Sydney. ""There´s a similar atmosphere with some politicians trying to deploy the China threat as a domestic political tool."" Bland described a dramatic shift in how politicians talk about China in both the U.K. and Australia, from a focus on trade and business ties five years ago to viewing China ""through the prism of a threat to national security and economic competitiveness."" In the Australian election, conservatives broke from a bipartisanship tradition on critical national security issues to accuse the center-left Labor Party of being likely to appease Beijing. The gambit came up short. Labor, whose victory ended nine years of conservative rule, denied it would shift its China policy and has called China's military drills around Taiwan ""disproportionate and destabilizing."" ""This is not something that solely Australia is calling for,"" Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong said, adding the entire region was concerned. A Lowy Institute survey released in June found Australians increasingly concerned about their nation´s largest trading partner. Three-quarters of respondents said it was at least somewhat likely China would become a military threat to Australia in the next 20 years, up 30 percentage points since 2018. A Pew Research Center poll the same month found negative views of China are at or near historic highs in many of the 19 countries surveyed in North America, Europe and Asia. Relations between London and Beijing have soured since President Xi Jinping was granted a 2015 state visit the U.K. government hoped would cement deals to give Britain a vast pool of investment and China greater access to European markets. Johnson, who took power in 2019, always stressed that he was not a ""knee-jerk Sinophobe"" - but under pressure from the U.S., his government excluded Chinese firms from the U.K.'s 5G communications network. Britain also has welcomed thousands of people from Hong Kong as Beijing squeezes the freedoms in the former British colony. The head of the MI6 intelligence agency, Richard Moore, said last month that China had overtaken terrorism as its top priority, as British spies try to understand the threats Beijing's growing assertiveness might pose. ""That feels like a very big moment, post-9/11,"" Moore said. The U.S. also is shifting intelligence resources to China. Yet China experts say much of the rhetoric from Western politicians is just political grandstanding. Steve Tsang, director of the China Institute at the London University School of Oriental and African Studies, said neither candidate seeking to be Britain's next prime minister has articulated a coherent policy on China. The winner is to be announced Sept. 5 after a Conservative Party vote. ""The indications are that (Sunak's) words on China policy are not based on any kind of a strategy,"" Tsang said. ""Nor has Truss articulated a proper China strategy, despite being the current foreign secretary."" China has pushed back against the growing hostility. ""I would like to make it clear to certain British politicians that making irresponsible remarks about China, including hyping the so-called `China threat,´ cannot solve one´s own problems,"" Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said after the Sunak-Truss debate. In the United States, both major political parties have railed against China on the campaign trail, particularly in the Midwest, where Chinese imports are blamed for a loss of manufacturing jobs. Pennsylvania Republican Senate nominee Mehmet Oz ran thousands of TV ads this spring that mentioned China. In Ohio, Democratic Senate contender Tim Ryan declared in one ad: ""It´s us vs. China."" Polling suggests neither China, nor foreign policy in general, is a top-of-mind issue for most U.S. voters. But political strategists believe China is likely to remain a potent political issue in the November U.S. congressional election, as candidates seek to link China to America's economic challenges. In Asia, it has been more nuanced. Japanese voters have become more supportive of a stronger military following the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the heightening tensions over Taiwan. In the presidential vote in South Korea in March, the candidates differed on how to manage the intensifying rivalry between two important partners, China and the U.S. South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol, who narrowly won, vowed to build a stronger alliance with the U.S., while his liberal opponent argued for a balancing act. But since taking office in May, Yoon has avoided upsetting China, an important export market. He did not meet Pelosi when she came to South Korea from Taiwan, though he spoke to her by phone, and his government has refrained from criticizing the Chinese military moves around the self-governing island. ___ Associated Press writers Jill Lawless in London, Ken Moritsugu in Beijing, Steve Peoples in New York, Rod McGuirk in Canberra, Australia, Kim Tong-hyung in Seoul, South Korea, and Mari Yamaguchi in Tokyo contributed to this report.

The Brave Commander cargo ship plans to leave the Ukrainian port of Yuzhne, east of Odesa, and sail to Djibouti, where the grain will be unloaded and transferred to Ethiopia under the World Food Program initiative. Ukraine and Russia reached a deal with Turkey on July 22 to restart Black Sea grain deliveries, addressing the major export disruption that has occurred since Russia invaded Ukraine in February. Ethiopia is one of five countries that the U.N. considers at risk of starvation. ""The capacity is there. The grain is there. The demand is there across the world and in particular, these countries,"" Denise Brown, the U.N. resident coordinator in Ukraine, told The Associated Press. ""So if the stars are aligned, we are very, very hopeful that all the actors around this agreement will come together on what is really an issue for humanity. So today was very positive."" On the front line, Russian forces fired rockets Sunday on the Mykolaiv region in southern Ukraine, killing at least one person. That region is just north of the Russian-occupied city of Kherson, which Ukrainian forces have vowed to retake. The Ukrainian emergency service said one person was killed in shelling early Sunday of the village of Bereznehuvate in Mykolaiv.

(AP Photo/Andriy Andriyenko) A Russian diplomat, meanwhile, called on Ukraine to offer security assurances so international inspectors could visit a nuclear power station in Ukraine that has come under fire. As fighting steps up in southern Ukraine, concerns have grown sharply about the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, which is held by Russian forces and has been hit by sporadic shelling. Both Ukraine and Russia blame each other for the shelling, which officials say has damaged monitoring equipment and could lead to a nuclear catastrophe. Ukraine's nuclear energy operator said Sunday that one person was killed in a Russian rocket attack on the city of Enerhodar where the plant is located. The Russia-controlled local government also reported the attack and the death, but blamed it on Ukrainian forces. The Zaporizhzhia facility is Europe's largest nuclear power plant. Russia's envoy to international organizations based in Vienna, Mikhail Ulyanov, called on Ukraine to stop attacking the plant in order to allow an inspection team in from the International Atomic Energy Agency. ""It is important that the Ukrainians stop their shelling of the station and provide security guarantees to members of the mission. An international team cannot be sent to work under continuous artillery shelling,"" he was quoted as saying Sunday by Russian state news agency Tass. Ukraine says Russia is shelling nearby regions from the plant and is storing weapons there. ___ Follow the AP´s coverage of the war at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine Local residents, many of whom fled the war, gather to hand out donated items such as medicines, clothes, and personal belongings to their relatives on the territories occupied by Russia, in Zaporizhzhia, Ukraine, Sunday, Aug. 14, 2022.

Artillery gutted most of the house, while the rest was pulverized by tank fire. Metla, 66, is now counting on her neighbors to have somewhere to live this winter. Crews of volunteers turn up on most mornings to prize away anything that can be reused - setting up neat piles of bricks, destroyed kitchen appliances for scrap metal, and chunks of insulation panels. The salvaged material is reused to help rebuild homes destroyed along the perimeter of Russia´s failed attempt during the initial stages of the war to surround and capture Ukraine's capital. The village of Novoselivka, 140 kilometers (nearly 90 miles) north of Kyiv, was a scene of intense fighting during the 36-day attack on the capital. Metal doors are buckled by bullet holes from heavy machine-gun fire and houses like Metla´s were smashed by ground and aerial bombardment. ""We dragged what we could to the basement. Five bombs - one, two, three, four, five - exploded in the field behind us,"" Meta said while standing in what used to be the living room of her destroyed home. She keeps a burned exercise bike and a religious icon of St. Nicholas as reminders of life before the war. Volunteers clear rubble on the second floor of Zhanna and Serhiy Dynaeva's house which was destroyed by Russian bombardment, in a residential area, in the village of Novoselivka, near Chernihiv, Ukraine, Saturday, Aug. 13, 2022. Residents in many heavily-damaged areas in Ukraine have set up their own initiatives to rebuild homes before the winter as international organizations rush aid to Ukraine to help with the reconstruction effort. (AP Photo/Evgeniy Maloletka) Ukraine's authorities said last month that the country had suffered more than $100 billion - equivalent to two-thirds of its 2020 gross domestic product - in infrastructure damage alone but estimate that the reconstruction effort could cost more than seven times that amount. Officials are appealing to Western countries to tap frozen Russian assets on top of what they are willing to donate to help pay for the bill. Container homes from Poland are being set up near Novoselivka, a village filled with orchards, sunflower patches, and back gardens with chickens, outside the historic northern city of Chernihiv. But the scale of the damage has prompted scores of local initiatives. ""In many other countries, if your home is destroyed, you might put up a `For Sale´ sign and move to another town. It´s not like that here,"" said Andriy Galyuga, a local volunteer organizer. ""People are very attached to where they are from and they don´t want to leave."" Galyuga´s organization, Bomozhemo, is in contact with similar initiatives that have sprung up all around the Ukrainian capital. At one smashed home, Galyuga bounds up a broken stairwell to direct a 25-member crew of volunteers loading salvaged cinder blocks onto a slide and determinedly prying off construction material with pickaxes and crowbars. Children and retired women help the effort watched by the worried home owner, Zhanna Dynaeva, who makes food for the workers, many of whom have also lost their homes. The gaunt-looking Dynaeva, is staying with a friend, but visits her home daily to maintain an immaculate garden. She carries trays of drinks and sandwiches on the day the volunteers came to visit. ""I am so grateful to them. People around me have helped so much,"" she said. As she gives an account of her escape from the bombardment, Dynaeva bursts into tears and is hugged by her homeless neighbor, Metla. ""I´m hoping I can stay on my property, maybe in a makeshift home to start,"" Dynaeva says. ""I don´t know what will happen to us. Winter will be here soon. I just worry all the time."" ___ Evgeniy Maloletka and Susie Blann contributed to this report. ___ Follow the AP´s coverage of the war at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine ___ Follow Derek Gatopoulos at https://twitter.com/dgatopoulos and Vasilisa Stepanenko at https://twitter.com/VasilisaUKR Volunteers clear rubbish on the second floor of Zhanna and Serhiy Dynaeva's house which was destroyed by Russian bombardment, in the village of Novoselivka, near Chernihiv, Ukraine, Saturday, Aug. 13, 2022.

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-11110069/Saudi-Aramcos-profits-88B-oil-prices-stay-high.html,2022-08-14,High oil prices help Saudi Aramco earn $88B in first half,"Saudi energy company Aramco said Sunday its profits jumped 90% in the second quarter compared to the same time last year, helping its half-year earnings reach nearly $88 billion. The increase is a boon for the kingdom and the crown prince's spending power as people around the world pay higher gas prices at the pump while energy companies rake in top earnings. Major oil companies had a strong quarter with Exxon Mobil booking an unprecedented $17.85 billion profit while Chevron made a record $11.62 billion. The U.K.´s Shell shattered its own profit record. Aramco's net profits were helped by second-quarter earnings ending in June that hit $48.4 billion - a figure higher than all of the first six months of 2021, when profits reached just $47 billion. It sets a new quarterly earnings record for Aramco since it first floated around 5% of the company on the Saudi stock market in late 2019. Its earnings for just this past quarter are almost what Aramco´s full-year profits were in 2020, when demand for oil crashed during pandemic lockdowns. Its half-year earnings of $87.9 billion put Aramco on track to far surpass the full-year earnings of 2019, prior to the pandemic, when profits hit $88 billion. The company credited the jump to higher crude oil prices and volumes sold, as well as higher refining margins. Saudi Arabia's vast oil reserves are among the cheapest to produce in the world. Aramco's finances are crucial to the kingdom's stability; when its margins are high, Saudi Arabia's economic growth reflects that. As countries around the world grapple with inflation and recession, the International Monetary Fund projects the Saudi economy will grow by more than 7.6% this year, the highest globally. FILE - Saudi Aramco engineers and journalists look at the Hawiyah Natural Gas Liquids Recovery Plant in Hawiyah, in the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia on June 28, 2021. Saudi oil company Aramco's half-year profits peaked just shy of $88 billion for the first half of the year as oil prices remain high globally. The oil and gas company, which is nearly entirely state-owned, said Sunday, Aug. 14, 2022, it also saw a 90% surge in net profits for the second quarter of 2022 compared to the same time last year. (AP Photo/Amr Nabil, File) Despite years of efforts by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to diversify the economy, and some success in increasing non-oil revenue, Saudi Arabia continues to rely heavily on crude exports that pay for public sector salaries, generous benefits to citizens and defense spending. Aramco's earnings also help the prince carry out his Vision 2030 infrastructure goals. The company will pay a dividend of $18.8 billion for the second quarter to shareholders, as it has promised to do since its debut on the stock market. The higher profits bode well for the Saudi government, which is the main shareholder of Aramco. Aramco is seen as the key to overhauling the Saudi economy. Its proceeds from the IPO were transferred to the country´s sovereign wealth fund to invest in projects to spur new sectors and generate new jobs for Saudi youth. Brent crude has been trading at around $100 a barrel, even as OPEC, led by Saudi Arabia, and non-OPEC producers, led by Russia, have been steadily increasing production levels that had been cut during the height of the pandemic. The price of oil rose sharply after Russia invaded Ukraine in February. Prices have dipped below the $100 mark in past weeks amid slowed-down economic growth in China and the U.S. Aramco President CEO Amin Nasser said he expects oil demand to continue to grow for the rest of the decade, despite current downward economic pressures. OPEC has said it expects world oil demand to rise by around 3 million barrels per day this year with total oil demand to average 100 million barrels a day. Nasser said Aramco's financial results so far this year reflect this increased demand for oil, even as countries around the world, including Saudi Arabia, pledge to cut their carbon emissions to avert catastrophic global warming levels. ""The world is calling out for affordable, reliable energy and we are answering that call,"" he said, urging greater investments in oil and gas. ""At a time when the world is worrying about energy security, you are investing in the future of our business. Our customers know that whatever happens, Aramco will always deliver,"" Nasser said in a short video released with the financial results. Saudi Arabia is currently producing around 10.5 million barrels per day, with much of that exported to Asia and its largest customer, China. The crown prince has said the kingdom's maximum production capacity is 13 million barrels per day. Aramco says it is working to one day reach that ceiling. Aramco produces all of Saudi Arabia´s oil and gas with its production limits dictated by the energy ministry. ___ Follow Aya Batrawy on twitter at https://twitter.com/ayaelb"

Germany, the European Union's biggest economy, is quickly trying to wean itself off using natural gas from Russia in response to Moscow's attack on Ukraine. However Germany uses more Russian gas imports than many other EU nations. Russia has already cut off gas exports to several EU nations, and officials fear Moscow will use the gas exports as a political weapon to get sanctions against Russia reduced - or even cut the exports to Europe off altogether in the winter, when demand is the highest. Economy Minister Robert Habeck said while the EU's 27 countries have pledged to cut their gas use by 15% from August compared to the previous five-year average, Germany needs to reduce its consumption by 20%. Habeck is also proposing banning the heating of non-commercial private pools; switching off heating in common areas of public buildings, such as foyers; and switching off the lights on public billboards between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m. ___ Follow all AP stories on developments related to the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine.

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-11108709/Afghan-rights-leader-heartbroken-year-Taliban-rule.html,2022-08-13,Afghan rights leader heartbroken after year of Taliban rule,"A year after the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan, prominent Afghan rights activist Sima Samar is still heartbroken over what happened to her country. Samar, a former minister of women´s affairs and the first chair of the Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission, left Kabul in July 2021 for the United States on her first trip after the COVID-19 pandemic, never expecting Afghan President Ashraf Ghani to flee the country and the Taliban to take power for the second time soon after on Aug. 15. ""I think it´s a sad anniversary for the majority of people of my country,"" Samar said, particularly for the women ""who don´t have enough food, who do not know what is the tomorrow for them."" A visiting scholar at the Carr Center for Human Rights at the Kennedy School at Harvard, she has written the first draft of an autobiography and is working on a policy paper on customary law relating to Afghan women. She is also trying to get a Green Card, but she said, ""I honestly cannot orient myself, where I am, and what I´m doing."" She wishes she could go home - but she can't. In an interview Friday with The Associated Press, she recalled a Taliban news conference a few days after they took power when they said if people apologized for past actions they would be forgiven. Sima Samar, a prominent activist and physician, who has been fighting for women's rights in Afghanistan for the past 40 years, speaks during an interview at her house in Kabul, Afghanistan, on March 6, 2021, six months before the Taliban takeover of her country. A year after that seismic shift, Samar says that she is still heartbroken over what happened to Afghanistan. (AP Photo/Rahmat Gul) ""And I said, I should be apologizing because I started schools for the people?"" said Samar, a member of Afghanistan's long persecuted Hazara minority. ""I should apologize because I started hospitals and clinics in Afghanistan? I should apologize because I tried to stop torture of the Taliban? I should apologize to advocate against the death penalty, including (for) the Taliban leadership?"" ""All my life I fought for life as a doctor,"" she said. ""So I cannot change and support the death penalty. I shouldn't apologize for those principles of human rights and be punished."" Samar became an activist as a 23-year-old medical student with an infant son. In 1984, the then-communist government arrested her activist husband, and she never saw him again. She fled to Pakistan with her young son and worked as a doctor for Afghan refugees and started several clinics to care for Afghan women and girls. Samar remembered the Taliban´s previous rule in the late 1990s, when they largely confined women to their homes, banned television and music, and held public executions. A U.S.-led invasion drove the Taliban from power months after the 9/11 attacks in 2001, which al-Qaida orchestrated from Afghanistan while being sheltered by the Taliban. After the Taliban´s ouster, Samar returned to Afghanistan, moving into the top women´s rights and human rights positions, and over the next 20 years schools and universities were opened for girls, women entered the workforce and politics and became judges. But Samar said in an AP interview in April 2021 - four months before the Taliban´s second takeover of the country - that the gains were fragile and human rights activists had many enemies in Afghanistan, from militants and warlords to those who wanted to stifle criticism or challenge their power. Samar said the Afghan government and leadership, especially Ghani, were mainly responsible for the Taliban sweeping into Kabul and taking power. But she also put blame on Afghans ""because we were very divided."" In every speech and interview she gave nationally and internationally over the years, she said Afghans had to be united and inclusive, and ""we have to have the people´s support. Otherwise, we will lose."" As chair of the Human Rights Commission, she said she repeatedly faced criticism that she was trying to impose Western values on Afghanistan. ""And I kept saying, human rights is not Western values. As a human being, everyone needs to have a shelter ... access to education and health services, to security,"" she said. Since their takeover, the Taliban have limited girls´ public education to just six years, restricted women´s work, encouraged them to stay at home, and issued dress codes requiring them to cover their faces. Samar urged international pressure not only to allow all girls to attend secondary school and university, but to ensure all human rights which are interlinked. And she stressed the importance of education for young boys, who without any schooling, job or skill could be at risk to get involved in opium production, weapons smuggling or in violence. She also urged the international community to continue humanitarian programs which are critical to save lives, but said they should focus on food-for-work or cash-for-work to end peoples' total dependency and give them ""self-confidence and dignity."" Samar said Afghan society has changed over the past two decades, with more access to technology, rising education levels among the young and some experience with elections, t even if they weren't free and fair. She said such achievements leave the possibility of positive change in the future. ""Those are the issues that they (the Taliban) cannot control,"" she said. ""They would like to, but they cannot do it."" Samar said she hoped for eventual accountability and justice for war crimes and crimes against humanity. ""Otherwise, we feel the culture of impunity everywhere, everywhere -- and the invasion of Russia to Ukraine is a repetition of Afghanistan´s case,"" she said. Her hope for Afghan women is that they can ""live with dignity rather than being a slave of people."""

A Russian rocket attack on the city of Kramatorsk killed three people and wounded 13 others Friday night, according to the mayor. Kramatorsk is the headquarters for Ukrainian forces in the country's war-torn east. The attack came less than a day after 11 other rockets were fired at the city, one of the two main Ukrainian-held ones in Donetsk province, the focus of an ongoing Russian offensive to capture eastern Ukraine's Donbas region. The Russian Defense Ministry claimed Saturday its forces had taken control of Pisky, a village on the outskirts of the city of Donetsk, the provincial capital that pro-Moscow separatists have controlled since 2014. Russian troops and the Kremlin-backed rebels are trying to seize Ukrainian-held areas north and west of the city of Donetsk to expand the separatists' self-proclaimed republic. But the Ukrainian military said Saturday that its forces had prevented an overnight advance toward the smaller cities of Avdiivka and Bakhmut. Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov also claimed that Russian strikes near Kramatorsk, 120 kilometers (75 miles) north of Donetsk city, destroyed a U.S.-supplied multiple rocket launcher and ammunition. Ukrainian authorities did not acknowledge any military losses but said Russian missile strikes Friday on Kramatorsk had destroyed 20 residential buildings. Valentyna Kondratieva, 75, walks into her damaged home Saturday, Aug. 13, 2022, where she sustained injuries in a Russian rocket attack last night in Kramatorsk, Donetsk region, eastern Ukraine. The strike killed three people and wounded 13 others, according to the mayor. The attack came less than a day after 11 other rockets were fired at the city. (AP Photo/David Goldman) Neither claim could be independently verified. The Ukrainian governor of neighboring Luhansk province, part of the Donbas region that was overrun by Russian forces last month, claimed that Ukrainian troops still held a small area in the province. Writing on Telegram, Luhansk Gov. Serhii Haidai said the defending troops were holed up inside an oil refinery on the edge of Lysychansk, a city that Moscow claimed to have captured, and also control areas near a village. ""The enemy is burning the ground at the entrances to the Luhansk region because it cannot overcome (Ukrainian resistance along) these few kilometers,"" Haidai said. ""It is difficult to count how many thousands of shells this territory of the free Luhansk region has withstood over the past month and a half."" Further west, the governor of the Dnipropetrovsk region reported more Russian shelling of the city of Nikopol, which lies across the Dnieper River from Europe's largest nuclear power plant. Gov. Yevhen Yevtushenko did not specify whether Russian troops had fired at Nikopol from the occupied Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant. Writing on Telegram, he said Saturday that there were no casualties but residential buildings, a power line and a gas pipeline were damaged. Nikopol has undergone daily bombardment for most of the past week, and a volley of shells killed three people and damaged 40 apartment buildings on Thursday, he said. Russia and Ukrainian officials have accused each other of shelling the Zaporizhzhia plant in contravention of nuclear safety rules. Russian troops have occupied the plant since the early days of Moscow's invasion, although the facility's Ukrainian nuclear workers continue to run it. Ukrainian military intelligence alleged Saturday that Russian troops were shelling the plant from a village just kilometers away, damaging a plant pumping station and a fire station. The intelligence directorate said the Russians had bused people into the power plant and mounted a Ukrainian flag on a gun on the outskirts of Enerhodar, the city where the plant is located. ""Obviously, it will be used for yet another provocation to accuse the armed forces of Ukraine,"" the directorate said, without elaborating. Ukrainian officials have repeatedly alleged that Russian forces were using the plant as a shield while firing at Ukrainian communities across the river, knowing that Ukrainian forces were unlikely to fire back for fear of triggering a nuclear accident. They said Russian shelling on Friday night killed one woman and injured two other civilians in the city of Zaporizhzhia. Ukraine's southern Mykolayiv region also said a woman died there in shelling. For several weeks, Ukraine's military has tried to lay the groundwork for a counteroffensive to reclaim southern Ukraine's Russian-occupied Kherson region. A local Ukrainian official reported Saturday that a Ukrainian strike had damaged the last working bridge over the Dnieper River in the region, further crippling Russian supply lines. ""The Russians no longer have any capability to fully turn over their equipment,"" Serhii Khlan, a deputy to the Kherson Regional Council, wrote on Facebook. The British Defense Ministry said Saturday that damage to bridges across the Dnieper means that ""ground resupply for the several thousand Russian troops on the west bank is almost certainly reliant on just two pontoon ferry crossing points."" ""Even if Russia manages to make significant repairs to the (damaged) bridges, they will remain a key vulnerability,"" the British said. On Saturday, the deputy director of the Russian-controlled Kakhovka hydropower plant 60 kilometers (37 miles) upriver from the city of Kherson said one of its generating units was out of service after a Ukrainian missile strike. Arseniy Zelenskyy said further strikes could endanger the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant because its water intakes use the reservoir formed by the Kakhovka plant's dam. Days after explosions at a Russian air base in Crimea destroyed up to a dozen aircraft, a Ukrainian presidential adviser said Kyiv should make retaking the Black Sea peninsula that Moscow annexed in 2014 one of its goals of the war. ""Russia started a war against Ukraine and the world in 2014, with its brazen seizure of Crimea. It is obvious that this war should end with the liberation of Crimea,"" Mykhailo Podoylak, the head of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's office, wrote Saturday on Twitter. ""And also with the legal punishment of the initiators of the `special military operation´"" - the Kremlin's term for its war in Ukraine. Ukrainian officials have not claimed responsibility for the explosions Tuesday at the Saki air base in Crimea. Russian defense officials have denied any aircraft were damaged - or that any attack even took place - attributing the blasts to on-site munitions that exploded. ___ Follow AP's coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine A pedestrian passes damaged homes Saturday, Aug. 13, 2022, from a Russian rocket attack last night in Kramatorsk, Donetsk region, eastern Ukraine.

The Cabinet shake-up, which was approved by parliament in an emergency session, affected 13 portfolios, including health, education, culture, local development and irrigation ministries. Also included in the reshuffle was the tourism portfolio, a key job at a time when Egypt is struggling to revive the lucrative sector decimated by years of turmoil, the pandemic and most recently the war in Europe. El-Sissi said the shake-up came in consultation with Prime Minister Mustafa Madbouly. It was the third cabinet shake-up since Madbouly was named prime minister in June 2018. The president said in a Facebook post that the changes aimed at ""developing the governmental performance in some important files ... which contribute to protecting the state´s interests and capabilities."" Banker Ahmed Issa took over the Tourism and Antiquities Ministry, replacing Khaled al-Anani who led Egypt's efforts in recent years to revive the tourism industry, a pillar of the economy. Such efforts included displaying ancient discoveries, opening new museums to attract international tourists.

The Cabinet shake-up was approved by the parliament in an emergency session Saturday, Aug. 13, 2022. (AP Photo/Vadim Ghirda, File) Hani Sweilam, professor of water resources management at Germany´s RWTH Aachen University, was named as Irrigation Minister. He replaced Mohammed Abdel-Aty who oversaw years of technical negations with Ethiopia over its controversial dam on the Nile River´s main tributary. The new ministers are expected to be sworn in by el-Sissi on Sunday, according to the state-run Al-Ahram daily. The changes, however, didn´t affect key ministries including foreign, finance, defense and the interior, which is responsible for the police force. Lawmaker Abdel-Monem Emam of the opposition Justice Party criticized the reshuffle as ""disappointing."" He said he hoped that the government´s economic team was included in the changes. ""What we - and the Egyptian street- were waiting for was changes in policies not persons,"" he wrote on Facebook. Egypt´s economy has been hard hit by the coronavirus pandemic and the ongoing war in Ukraine, which rattled global markets and hiked oil and food prices across the world. Egypt is the world´s largest wheat importer, most of which came from Russia and Ukraine. The country´s supply is subject to price changes on the international market. The government has held talks in recent months with the International Monetary Fund for a new loan to support its reform program and to help address challenges caused by the war in Europe. The government has received pledges from wealthy Arab Gulf nations for billions of dollars in investments, some of which are for private industry. Egyptians´ food and energy bills have soared, adding to the burden of poor and middle-class people who already bore the brunt of a 2016 reform program. That program, agreed on with the IMF, included painful austerity measures which sparked a steep rise in the price of basic and key commodities as well as services. A recent devaluation of the Egyptian pound, which already lost half of its value in 2016, caused new hikes in prices of food and other commodities. The annual inflation rate for July was at 14.6%, more than double the same month last year when it recorded 6.1%, according to official statistics bureau."

In an interview with The Associated Press, Ukrainian Health Minister Viktor Liashko said Russian authorities repeatedly have blocked efforts to provide state-subsidized drugs to people in occupied cities, towns and villages. ""Throughout the entire six months of war, Russia has not (allowed) proper humanitarian corridors so we could provide our own medicines to the patients that need them,"" Liashko said, speaking at the Health Ministry in Kyiv late Friday. ""We believe that these actions are being taken with intent by Russia, and we consider them to be crimes against humanity and war crimes that will be documented and will be recognized,"" the minister said. The Ukrainian government has a program that provides medications to people with cancer and chronic health conditions. The destruction of hospitals and infrastructure along with the displacement of an estimated 7 million people inside the country also have interfered with other forms of treatment, according to United Nations and Ukrainian officials. The war in Ukraine has caused severe disruptions to the country´s state-run health service, which was undergoing major reforms, largely in response to the coronavirus pandemic, when Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered his troops to invade on Feb. 24. Ukrainian Health Minister Viktor Liashko speaks to The Associated Press reporters during an interview on Friday, Aug. 12, 2022. Liashko accused Russian authorities of blocking access to affordable medicines in areas of Ukraine it has occupied since the invasion was launched on Feb. 24. He described the action as a ""crime against humanity."" (AP Photo/Vasilisa Stepanenko) The World Health Organization said it recorded 445 attacks on hospitals and other health care facilities as of Aug. 11 that directly resulted in 86 deaths and 105 injuries. But Liashko said the secondary effects were far more severe. ""When roads and bridges have been damaged in areas now controlled by the Ukrainian forces... it is difficult to get someone who had a heart attack or a stroke to the hospital,"" he said. ""Sometimes, we can´t make it in time, the ambulance can´t get there in time. That´s why war causes many more casualties (than those killed in the fighting).

Czechia became the last central European country after Slovakia and Hungary to receive deliveries from the southern branch of the Druzhba pipeline after a problem over payments for transit was resolved. Russian state pipeline operator Transneft said Tuesday it halted shipments through the southern branch of the Druzhba pipeline, which runs through Ukraine to Czechia, Slovakia and Hungary. The northern leg of the Druzhba pipeline, which runs through Belarus to Poland and Germany, was unaffected. Transneft cited complications due to European Union sanctions for its action on Aug. 4, saying its payment to the company´s Ukrainian counterpart was refused. On Wednesday, the payment was made by Slovak refiner Slovnaft after both Russia and Ukraine agreed to the solution. Slovnaft is owned by Hungary´s MOL energy group. But Slovnaft said the deal covered only shipments to Slovakia and Hungary and not to Czechia.

Russian state pipeline operator Transneft said it halted shipments through the southern branch of the Druzhba oil pipeline, which flows through Ukraine to the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary. (AP Photo/Bela Szandelszky, File) Slovak Economy Minister Richard Sulik said the problem was caused by the refusal of an unnamed bank in Western Europe to transfer the money due to the sanctions imposed by the EU on Russia for its war on Ukraine. Czech Industry and Trade Minister Jozef Kisela said Friday that authorities had found a way to make the original money transfer possible. He declined to give details. Two Czech oil refiners, including the one in Litvinov that processes Russian oil, are owned by Poland´s oil and energy giant PKN Orlen. EU leaders agreed in May to embargo most Russian oil imports by the end of the year as part of the bloc´s sanctions over Moscow´s invasion of Ukraine. The embargo covers Russian oil brought in by sea, but allowed temporary Druzhba pipeline shipments to Hungary and certain other landlocked countries in central Europe, such as Slovakia and Czechia. The Czechs receive less than a half of the oil the country needs through the Druzhba pipeline. ___ Follow AP´s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine"

Portugal and Spain could send a lot of the liquefied natural gas, or LNG, they receive from around the world to other European Union countries, Prime Minister Antonio Costa said. He gave no further details, but such an undersea pipeline would likely take years to complete. EU countries have struggled to find common ground on how to wean the bloc off its reliance on Russian natural gas. Russian President Vladimir Putin has weaponized gas exports to pressure the bloc into reducing its sanctions over the war in Ukraine. Putin has already cut off gas exports to more than a dozen EU nations and reduced exports to key industrial powerhouses like Germany. Many European officials fear he could cut off gas exports to most of Europe over the winter, a time of key demand. The two Iberian countries receive LNG via pipeline from Algeria and Morocco, as well as by ship from countries such as the United States and Nigeria. But there are currently scant energy connections between Spain and Portugal and rest of Europe. ""The Iberian peninsula has capacity to replace a large part of the liquefied natural gas that central Europe today imports from Russia,"" Costa told reporters. With six LNG plants in Spain - including Europe´s largest, in Barcelona - and one in Portugal, the Iberian neighbors account for one-third of Europe´s LNG processing capacity. The port-based terminals turn boatloads of supercooled LNG back into gas that then flows into homes and businesses.

That option would get around France's opposition to a gas link-up across the Pyrenees between the Iberian peninsula and central Europe. (AP Photo/Alastair Grant, file) Costa said the Iberian plants could also send more LNG by ship to other European ports while a pipeline is being built. Costa said the French government is still against a pipeline across the Pyrenees, citing environmental concerns, and added that the European Commission is assessing a link to Italy. Costa´s comments came after German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, speaking Thursday in Berlin, said, ""I have spent a lot of time dealing with a pipeline that we sorely lack, namely the pipeline that should have been built between Portugal, Spain through France to central Europe."" He added: ""It would now make a massive contribution to relieving and easing the supply situation."" Scholz said he had been in talks with Spain, Portugal, France and the European Commission about the project. The German chancellor's comments were welcomed by Portugal and Spain, which could reap the benefits of their investments in LNG. ""Spain is well prepared,"" Spanish Industry Minister Reyes Maroto told Antena 3 television on Friday. ""We hope that if the German chancellor´s proposal prospers, we will have better gasification and more interconnections in Europe so as not to depend on Russian gas and be self-sufficient energy wise."" The U.S. government and businesses have long been eyeing Portugal´s deep water Atlantic port of Sines as a springboard for expansion. They have identified Sines as a potential gateway to Europe for gas from fracking in the United States, which has allowed the U.S. to boost LNG exports and offer low prices. ___ Ciaran Giles in Madrid and Frank Jordans in Berlin contributed. ___ Follow all AP stories on the fallout from the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine."

It will be the first food delivery to Africa under a U.N. plan to unblock grain trapped by Russia´s war on Ukraine and bring relief to some of the millions worldwide who are on the brink of starvation. For months, fighting in Ukraine and a Russian blockade of Ukraine's ports meant that grain produced in Ukraine, one of the world's key breadbaskets, piled up in silos. That sent global food prices sky-high and led to hunger in Africa, the Middle East and parts of Asia. In recent days, several ships carrying grain have left Ukrainian ports under the new deal - but most of those shipments were animal feed and went to Turkey or Western Europe under previous contracts. U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said the ship named Brave Commander will carry its wheat to the Horn of Africa nation of Djibouti, where it will be unloaded and sent on to Ethiopia. ""The wheat will go to the World Food Program´s operations in Ethiopia, supporting the Horn of Africa drought response as the threat of famine stalks the drought-hit region,"" he said. ""It is one of many areas around the world where the near-complete halt of Ukrainian grain and food on the global market has made life even harder for the families already struggling with rising hunger."" The ship was expected to take on more than 23,000 metric tons, according to Ukraine's Infrastructure Ministry - still only a tiny portion of the 20 million tons of grain languishing now in Ukraine. It docked in the port city of Yuzhne late Friday, the ministry said. Ethiopia, along with neighboring Somalia and Kenya, is facing the worst drought in four decades in the Horn of Africa. Thousands of people across the region have died from hunger or illness this year. Forecasts for the coming weeks indicate that for the first time, a fifth straight rainy season will fail to materialize.

""Food assistance needs are at record levels, with up to 15 million people in need of food assistance."" While one shipment won't solve the crisis, the World Food Program still heralded it as an ""important step"" in getting Ukrainian grain out of the country to the worst-affected countries. Ethiopian officials did not respond to requests for comment. Yet on Ukraine's front lines, the fighting was incessant, especially in the eastern region of the Donbas, where much of the fighting has been centered as the war approaches the six-month mark. The town of Kramatorsk was hit by 11 rockets overnight. Seven people were killed and 14 others were wounded in and around the town, which remains cut off from gas, running water and electricity. ""Three quarters of the population of the region have already been evacuated, because incessant shelling by the Russian army doesn´t leave civilians any choice - it´s either to die from wounds, or from hunger and cold in winter,"" Donetsk regional governor Pavlo Kyrylenko told Ukrainian television. The threat of a nuclear accident also loomed in southern Ukraine, where shelling has hit near Europe's largest nuclear plant. Shelling near the Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant continued overnight. Russian forces fired more than 40 rockets at the city of Marhanets, which is across the Dnieper River from the power plant. Three people were wounded in the most recent shelling, including a 12-year-old boy. The neighboring city of Nikopol was shelled as well, said Valentyn Reznichenko, the governor of the Dnipropetrovsk region. The U.N. nuclear chief warned late Thursday that ""very alarming"" military activity at the nuclear plant could lead to dangerous consequences. International Atomic Energy Agency Director-General Rafael Grossi urged Russia and Ukraine, who blame each other for the attacks at the nuclear plant, to immediately allow nuclear experts to assess damage and evaluate safety and security at the sprawling nuclear complex. He said the situation at the plant ""has been deteriorating very rapidly."" He pointed to shelling and several explosions at Zaporizhzhia last Friday that forced the shutdown of its electrical power transformer and two backup transformers, forcing the shutdown of one nuclear reactor. Ukrainian Interior Minister Denys Monastyrsky said authorities were drafting plans to evacuate residents from towns and villages near the plant. ""There is a high-level threat, so there are plans for any possible development, including release of radiation,"" Monastyrsky said Friday. ""We all have seen the Russian shelling of the plant. It´s horrible."" He said Russian forces have stationed weapons at the plant and have denied Ukrainian nuclear workers access to some areas in the complex. ""It´s hard to even imagine the scale of tragedy if the Russians continue their action there,"" he said. ""We have become convinced that there is no restraining factors. There is a deliberate stand declared by the Russian authorities that they are ready for any action, regardless of consequences."" -- Associated Press writer Edith M.

Meeting South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol in Seoul, Guterres said he affirms the U.N.´s ""clear commitment to the full, verifiable and irreversible denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and DPRK,"" using the initials of North Korea´s formal name, the Democratic People´s Republic of Korea. ""There´s a fundamental objective to bring peace, security and stability to the whole region,"" he told Yoon, while also praising South Korea´s participation in international peacekeeping efforts and fighting climate change. Guterres, who arrived in South Korea on Thursday, later met with South Korean Foreign Minster Park Jin, who said the U.N.-led international community should be communicating a stern and unified message to North Korea that its nuclear ambitions won't be tolerated. Park called for the U.N.´s help in finding an effective solution to the North Korean nuclear issue, and Guterres expressed support for South Korean efforts to stabilize peace in the peninsula, the Foreign Ministry said. North Korea has test-fired more than 30 ballistic missiles this year, including its first flights of intercontinental ballistic missiles since 2017, as leader Kim Jong Un pushes to advance his nuclear arsenal in the face of what North Korea has called ""gangster-like"" U.S.-led pressure and sanctions. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres talks with South Korean Foreign Minister Park Jin during their meeting at the Foreign Ministry in Seoul, South Korea, Friday, Aug. 12, 2022. (Jeon Heon-Kyun/Pool Photo via AP) The unusually fast pace in weapons demonstrations also underscore brinkmanship aimed at forcing Washington to accept the idea of North Korea as a nuclear power and negotiating badly needed sanctions relief and security concessions from a position of strength, experts say. The U.S. and South Korean governments have also said the North is gearing up to conduct its first nuclear test since September 2017, when it claimed to have detonated a nuclear warhead designed for its ICBMs. While the Biden administration has said it would push for additional sanctions if North Korea conducts another nuclear test, the prospects for meaningful punitive measures are unclear. China and Russia recently vetoed U.S.-sponsored resolutions at the U.N. Security Council that would have increased sanctions on the North over some of its ballistic missile testing this year, underscoring division between the council´s permanent members that has deepened over Russia´s war on Ukraine. Guterres´ meetings with South Korean officials came a day after North Korea claimed a widely disputed victory over COVID-19 but also blamed rival South Korea for the outbreak, vowing ""deadly"" retaliation. The North insists its initial infections were caused by leaflets and other objects flown across the border on balloons launched by South Korea's anti-Pyongyang activists, a claim Seoul describes as unscientific and ""ridiculous."" North Korea has a history of dialing up pressure on the South when it doesn´t get what it wants from the United States, and there are concerns that North Korea's threat portends a provocation, which might include nuclear or missile tests or even border skirmishes.

While a significant proportion of the KramAgroSvit farm's revenues also once came from cultivating wheat, continuing that work comes with risks. As a farm employee harvested wheat with a grain combine on Sunday, the machine hit two land mines, resulting in a fire that burned more than 60% of the worker´s body. The worker survived, but is in critical condition as doctors tend to an infection. An inspection by an emergency services team found 19 additional mines in the field, said Ihor Kriuchenko, the farm's senior livestock technician, adding that going out to harvest now is ""very dangerous due to the shelling and mines."" Farmhands drive combines around visible artillery fragments to avoid them. Such realities of war have created a cascading series of complications that coalesced to drive the farm's business down dramatically. In the nearby city of Kramatorsk, the provisional capital of Donetsk province, Russia's attacks and a lack of gas for heating and cooking have caused most residents to evacuate, creating less demand for dairy products and, consequently, falling profits.

One of the last working dairy farms in Ukraine's eastern Donbas region is doing everything it can to stay afloat amid Russia's devastating war where not even the cows are safe. ""The animals are acting differently, they're scared just like we are,"" she said ""They just can't say it out loud."" (AP Photo/David Goldman) Business also took a hit as Russian forces captured several other cities where the farm had distributed its milk and those markets disappeared behind the front line. Such conditions - disrupted demand and supply chains along with danger from shelling and mines - have made the prospect of farming in eastern Ukraine fraught with risks that threaten the future of the KramAgroSvit farm, which has been in business since 2003. ""This farm was hit (by a rocket), and 38 cows were killed, plus some of our farming equipment and vehicles were destroyed. Investors decided it was too risky to keep so many cows here, so they were sold abroad,"" Kriuchenko said. The farm's owner had all the pigs and rabbits once raised there slaughtered and sold amid the uncertainty, he said. Anna Lavrenyuk, general director of Ukraine´s Association of Milk Producers, said at the end of June that Ukrainian dairy farms lost at least 50,000 head of cattle worth an estimated $136 million during the first three months of the war. Approximately 800 industrial dairy farms lost assets that included animals, barns, farming equipment and animal feed, Lavrenyuk said, while milk yields in front-line and Russian-occupied territories dropped by more than half since the war began. Ukrainian milk production was likely to fall to 2 million tons for the year, down by 750,000 tons since 2021, she said. Only around a third of the KramAgroSvit farm´s previous staff of 63 employees remains, Kriuchenko said, and revenues have dropped six-fold since Russian forces launched their offensive to seize the Donbas, an industrial region made up of Donetsk and neighboring Luhansk province. One such worker, Nataliia Onatska, lined up around 50 cows side by side on Wednesday and attached vacuum pumps to their udders in one of the farm's long, musty milking hangars. She's spent her entire life on a farm and calls her job ""the point of my life."" ""I wish everything was like it was before and everyone had kept their jobs,"" Onatska said. ""It's scary to live now. I'm just living from day to day."" The farm now feeds its wheat to the cows as grain prices have fallen and logistics costs have spiked, Kriuchenko said. The crop wasn't profitable on the market because of a Russian naval blockade of Ukraine´s Black Sea ports that a U.N.-brokered agreement is only now slowly remedying. But of all the myriad challenges facing the farm, he said, the most difficult part has been saying goodbye to colleagues who had invested so much in its success. Amid the cutbacks, he said, he had to fire his wife. ""It was very hard and sad to let all our staff go. Our team was brought together from nothing, and there was great teamwork, everything was good,"" he said. ""It was a shock for me to say goodbye to them."" As Halyna Borysenko, another worker in the dairy, finished milking the cows for the day, she said she pitied them for also having to live through the war. ""The animals are acting differently. They're scared just like we are,"" she said. ""They just can't say it out loud."" ___ Follow AP's coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine Ihor Kriuchenko, senior livestock technician, stands next to a few of the cows that remain at KramAgroSvit dairy farm in Dmytrivka, Donetsk region, eastern Ukraine, Wednesday, Aug. 10, 2022.

The move follows China´s boosting of its relations with Russia, whose invasion of Ukraine is seen as a possible first step in a series of moves against countries that were once part of the Soviet Union. China has refused to criticize Russia and has condemned punishing economic sanctions imposed on Moscow by the West. Weeks before the invasion, Chinese President and Communist Party leader Xi Jinping hosted Russian President Vladimir Putin in Beijing and declared their bilateral relations had ""no limits"" in a joint statement. The move also comes after Beijing launched economic and diplomatic retaliation against another Baltic state, Lithuania, in retaliation for its expanded ties with the self-governing island democracy of Taiwan, which China claims as its own territory and threatens to annex by force. China´s increasing assertiveness and recent threatening military exercises near Taiwan have brought a sharp backlash from the U.S., the EU, Japan, Australia and others. ""In view of the current priorities of Latvian foreign and trade policy, Latvia has decided to cease its participation in the cooperation framework of Central and Eastern European Countries and China,"" Latvia's Foreign Ministry said in a statement Thursday. The country ""will continue to strive for constructive and pragmatic relations with China both bilaterally, as well as through EU-China cooperation based on mutual benefit, respect for international law, human rights and the international rules-based order,"" the statement said. FILE - Chinese President Xi Jinping, right, and Russian President Vladimir Putin talk to each other during their meeting in Beijing, Feb. 4, 2022. Latvia and Estonia say they have left a Chinese-backed forum aimed at boosting relations with Eastern European countries, in what appears to be a new setback for China's increasingly assertive diplomacy. The move follows China's boosting of its relations with Russia, whose invasion of Ukraine is seen as a possible first step in a series of moves against countries that were once part of the Soviet Union. (Alexei Druzhinin, Sputnik, Kremlin Pool Photo via AP, File) Estonia issued a similar statement, saying it would ""continue to work towards constructive and pragmatic relations with China, which includes advancing EU-China relations in line with the rules-based international order and values such as human rights."" ""Estonia participated in the cooperation format of Central and Eastern Europe and China from 2012. Estonia has not attended any of the meetings of the format after the summit last February,"" the statement said. China set up the forum to strengthen relations with members of the EU as well as Serbia and others, partly to further Xi's signature Belt and Road campaign to build bridges, railways, power plants and other infrastructure across the Eurasian continent. China originally styled the forum as a ""17 plus one"" arrangement, but the number of European partners has now fallen to 14. Critics say the forum was an attempt to exploit differences among those states as part of a larger campaign to join with Russia in undermining the current rules-based international order dominated by the U.S. and its allies. Along with its stance on Ukraine, China has come under strong criticism for firing missiles and sending ships and warplanes off the coast of Taiwan in response to a visit there by U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. China strongly opposes all government-to-government contacts between Taiwan and countries which, like the U.S., maintain only informal ties with the island in deference to Beijing. China issued no immediate comment on the move by Latvia and Estonia, but Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin on Friday again defended the threatening military exercises. ""To defend our sovereignty and territorial integrity ... China has every right to take resolute countermeasures in response to the U.S. provocations, and such measures are absolutely necessary under those circumstances,"" Wang said at a daily briefing. Britain summoned China's ambassador to register its over the ""increasingly aggressive behavior and rhetoric from Beijing in recent months, which threaten peace and stability in the region,"" Foreign Secretary Liz Truss was quoted as saying. ""The United Kingdom urges China to resolve any differences by peaceful means, without the threat or use of force or coercion."" Beijing's threats against Taiwan are a major contributing factor in the deterioration of U.S.-China relations to their lowest level in decades. China has also engaged in a lengthy feud with Australia and its firing of missiles last week drew condemnation from Japan, whose exclusive economic zone includes waters where the projectiles landed. In another rejection, South Korea on Wednesday said it will make its own decisions about strengthening its defenses against North Korean threats amid Chinese calls that it continue the polices of Seoul´s previous government that refrained from adding more U.S. anti-missile batteries, which are strongly opposed by Beijing. Asked about the developments, U.S. State Department spokesperson Vedant Patel said ""we respect and support Estonia and Latvia´s sovereign decision to no longer participate."" ""Estonia and Latvia are important and valued NATO allies and key U.S. partners across a number of issues, including through our strong defense ties, our strong economic ties, as well as the promotion of democracy and human rights,"" Patel told reporters. ""Over the past year, we´ve seen countries around the world express deep concern about the PRC´s strategic alignment with Russia as well as Beijing´s support for Moscow´s war against Ukraine,"" Patel said. ""There is a growing convergence about the need to approach relations with Beijing with more realism,"" he said, citing previous comments from Secretary of State Antony Blinken. Concluding a five-day visit to Taipei on Thursday, Lithuanian Deputy Minister of Transport and Communications Agne Vaiciukeviciute emphasized the importance of economic ties with Taiwan and endorsed a statement issued by the Group of Seven industrialized nations criticizing the Chinese military exercises surrounding Taiwan. The European Union issued a similar statement, prompting China to summon the group's ambassadors to register a protest. ""Lithuania is a democracy. Taiwan is our very close friend, and Taiwan is a booming economy,"" Vaiciukeviciute said. ""Lithuania chooses to cooperate with countries that are willing to cooperate with us. So, Taiwan is one of those countries and they are reliable partners,"" she said. In response to her visit, China´s Foreign Ministry on Friday announced it was suspending ""all forms of interaction"" with her ministry as well as ""exchanges and cooperation with Lithuania in the area of international roadway transport."" China has already banned trade with Lithuania, with little apparent effect on the country that is a member of both the EU and NATO. The EU has raised a complaint over the Chinese action with the World Trade Organization."

Under a grim gray sky, the two women and eight men were buried following their discovery in a mass grave near the town's Church of Andrew the Apostle, in the wake of the Russian withdrawal in late March. The 11th victim had been shot dead and was found in the village of Chervone, 17 kilometers (10 miles) further outside the Ukrainian capital. Another man who was shot dead but who was identified was also buried Thursday at the same cemetery. The civilian killings at Bucha have become a symbol of brutality of the war. They were carried out as Russia launched a failed effort to capture the Ukrainian capital after it invaded the country on Feb. 24.

The process of identification began in April at several morgues in Kyiv region. The bodies are buried one month after the autopsy, remaining unidentified if relatives cannot be found to formally name them. Oleksandr Khmaruk, 37, was originally listed as a number, as his parents at first were unable to find his body due to a bureaucratic mix-up. Khmaruk, who served in the Ukrainian armed forces in 2014-15, is believed to have been dragged from his home and shot at a checkpoint by Russian soldiers. He was one of the 458 dead in Bucha after the Russian occupation and was found in the same mass grave as the 10 unnamed bodies that were buried Thursday. His family also buried him Thursday at the same cemetery. ""We are working with a list of approximately 50 bodies that remain unidentified,"" said Mykhailyna Skoryk-Shkarivska, the deputy mayor of Bucha, adding that the number can change as more family members are found.

Rafael Grossi urged Russia and Ukraine, who blame each other for the attacks at the plant, to immediately allow nuclear experts to assess damage and evaluate safety and security at the sprawling nuclear complex where the situation ""has been deteriorating very rapidly."" He pointed to shelling and several explosions at Zaporizhzhia last Friday that forced the shutdown of the electrical power transformer and two backup transformers, forcing the shutdown of one nuclear reactor. Last week, Grossi said in an Associated Press interview that the situation at Zaporizhzhia was ""completely out of control."" On Thursday, he demanded a halt to military actions ""that have even the smallest potential to jeopardize nuclear safety"" at such an important installation. While a preliminary assessment by experts found ""no immediate threat to nuclear safety"" at the plant from the shelling and military actions, ""this could change at any moment,"" he warned. Grossi's appeal echoed U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres´ call earlier Thursday for an end to all military activity around the Zaporizhzhia plant, warning that any damage could lead to ""catastrophic consequences"" in the vicinity, the region and beyond.

The Zaporizhzhia plant is in southern Ukraine, near the town of Enerhodar on the banks of the Dnieper River. It is one of the 10 biggest nuclear plants in the world. Russia and Ukraine have accused each other of shelling Europe's largest nuclear power plant, stoking international fears of a catastrophe on the continent. This photo was taken during a trip organized by the Russian Ministry of Defense. (AP Photo, File) Grossi, director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, gave a virtual briefing to the U.N. Security Council at a meeting called by Russia to discuss what Moscow claims were Ukrainian attacks on the plant. While the plant is controlled by Russia, its Ukrainian staff continues to run the nuclear operations. It is in Enerhodar, a city seized by Russian troops in early March soon after they invaded Ukraine. Grossi said statements received from Russia and Ukraine ""are frequently contradicted"" and the IAEA can´t corroborate important facts unless its experts visit Zaporizhzhia. Russian Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia told the council that ""Kyiv´s criminal attacks on nuclear infrastructure are pushing the world to the brink of nuclear catastrophe."" He accused Ukrainian armed forces in recent days of repeatedly using heavy artillery and multiple-launch rocket systems to shell the Zaporizhzhia plant, including on Thursday. ""The background radiation at the nuclear power plant at the moment is within limits, but if the strikes continue it is only a question of time,"" Nebenzia warned. ""We call on states that support the Kyiv regime to bring their proxies into check to compel them to immediately and once and for all stop attacks."" Ukraine´s U.N. ambassador, Sergiy Kyslytsya, accused Russia of using ""elaborate plans of deceit, sabotage and cover-ups"" to stage the shelling at Zaporizhzhia, including on Thursday, which poses ""an unprecedented threat to nuclear security for Ukraine, to Europe and the world as a whole."" The Ukrainian state company operating the plant, Enerhoatom, said there was renewed Russian shelling of the Zaporizhzhia facility and nearby buildings Thursday. ""Five (hits) were recorded near the plant management´s office - right next to the welding site and the storage facility for radiation sources,"" Enerhoatom said in a post on its official Telegram channel. ""The grass caught fire over a small area, but fortunately, no one was hurt."" Ukraine´s ambassador told the council the only way to remove the nuclear threats is by withdrawing Russian troops and returning the plant to Ukraine´s control. Nebenzia said Russia supported an IAEA visit in June to Zaporizhzhia, which was given ""a red light"" at the last minute by U.N. security experts. Moscow is ready to provide ""all possible assistance"" to resolve any issues for a visit ""even before the end of August,"" he said. Yevhen Balytskyy, the Kremlin-installed temporary head of the Zaporizhzhia region, said Thursday that the Russia-backed administration there stood ready to ensure the safety and security of any IAEA delegation sent to investigate conditions. He said in an interview on Russian state TV that the Kremlin-backed authorities had prepared armored vehicles for the international envoys. Kyslytsya blamed Russia´s ""unjustified conditions"" for the delay in getting IAEA experts to Zaporizhzhia, and said Ukraine stands ready to provide ""all necessary assistance"" to facilitate the nuclear team´s travels through Ukrainian-controlled territory, which is just five miles from the plant across the Dnieper River. Bonnie Jenkins, U.S. undersecretary of state for arms control, called the situation at Zaporizhzhia ""another tragic result"" of Russia´s invasion of Ukraine. She said the solution is straightforward: Russia should immediately withdraw its forces from Ukraine so Ukrainians can to restore ""the impeccable safety, security, and safeguards performance it upheld for decades at the facility."" At the end of the council meeting, Grossi said there was ""a common denominator"" among the 15 members: ""Everybody agrees that nuclear safety and security must be preserved. ... And everybody believes that this mission must take place."" ""So, it´s no longer a matter of if, it´s only a matter of when,"" the U.N. nuclear chief said. ""The when must be as soon as possible."" Guterres appealed in a statement ""for common sense and reason"" to avoid any actions ""that might endanger the physical integrity, safety or security of the nuclear plant,"" and for the withdrawal of all military personnel and equipment. The Russian capture of Zaporizhzhia renewed fears that reactors at the largest of Ukraine´s four nuclear plants could be damaged, setting off another emergency like the 1986 Chernobyl accident, the world´s worst nuclear disaster. That happened about 110 kilometers (65 miles) north of the capital Kyiv. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy told defense leaders at a conference in Copenhagen on Thursday that the consequences of a radiation accident at Zaporizhzhia ""could be even more catastrophic than Chernobyl, and essentially the same as the use of nuclear weapons by Russia, but without a nuclear strike."" ""If the Soviet authorities tried to hide the Chernobyl disaster and its full consequences, Russian authorities are much more cynical and dangerous,"" he said. ""They are doing everything themselves to maximize the risk of a nuclear disaster, and lie to the whole world that someone else is allegedly to blame."" ___ Associated Press writer Joanna Kozlowska in London contributed to this report.

""Russian citizens´ opportunity to visit Estonia in large numbers or to visit Europe through Estonia is incompatible with the meaning of the sanctions we´ve established,"" Foreign Minister Urmas Reinsalu was quoted as saying by the Baltic News Service said. The European Union, of which Estonia is a member, already has banned air travel from Russia after it invaded Ukraine. But Russians can still travel by land to Estonia and apparently are then take flights to other European destinations. By imposing the sanction, Estonia wants Russia ""to be unable to continue its ordinary international life also at the level of its citizens,"" Reinsalu said according to BNS, the region's main news agency. He added that they had observed ""a massive growth in the number of Russian citizens transiting through or arriving in Estonia."" BNS said exceptions to Thursday's sanction included Russian citizens with a long-term residence permit; those coming to visit close relatives; workers involved in the international transport of goods and passengers, as well as people entering the country for humanitarian reasons. The Estonian sanction applies beginning Aug. 18. Estonia and Russia share a nearly 300 kilometer (186-mile) long border. ""I call on other governments to follow such steps,"" Reinsalu wrote on Twitter. Earlier this week, Estonian and Finnish leaders urged fellow European countries to stop issuing tourist visas to Russian citizens, saying they should not be able to take vacations in Europe while the Russian government carries out a war in Ukraine. Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas wrote Tuesday on Twitter that ""visiting Europe is a privilege, not a human right"" and that it is ""time to end tourism from Russia now."" A day earlier, her counterpart in Finland, Sanna Marin, told Finnish broadcaster YLE that ""it is not right that while Russia is waging an aggressive, brutal war of aggression in Europe, Russians can live a normal life, travel in Europe, be tourists."" Russian companies reportedly have started offering car trips from St. Petersburg to the airports in Helsinki and Lappeenranta in Finland, which have direct connections to several places in Europe. Russia´s second-largest city is 300 kilometers (186 miles) from the Finnish capital. Visas issued by Finland and Estonia are valid across most of Europe´s visa-free travel zone, known as the ""Schengen area"" which is made up of 26 countries: 22 EU nations plus Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland. Normally, people and goods move freely between these countries without border checks. Nineteen other countries outside this travel area allow in foreigners using a Schengen visa. Because of the war, Latvia has already decided it no longer is issuing visas to Russians. Poland said Wednesday that it was no longer issuing tourist visas to Russians. ___ Follow all AP stories on the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine."

Sixty-seven lawmakers in the 100-seat assembly voted in favor of adopting the statement and 16 abstained, the Parliament said. The resolution says Russian forces are deliberately targeting Ukrainian civilians in the war, including with attacks on a theater in Mariupol in March, a shopping mall in Kremenchuk in June and a residential area of Odesa in July. Russia rejects deliberately targeting civilians in the conflict, which it describes as a ""special military operation.""

(The Parliament, Saeima, of the Republic of Latvia via AP) The Latvian Parliament also called on Western countries to reinforce sanctions on Russia and urged fellow members of the European Union to stop issuing tourist visas to citizens of Russia and Belarus. The Foreign Affairs Committee of the Latvian Parliament adopted the statement last week before submitting it to the full assembly. Committee chairman Rihars Kols said the resolution was a political statement that could have practical implications by inspiring other countries to take similar measures, adding momentum to efforts to reinforce sanctions on Moscow and set up a tribunal to prosecute war crimes. Neighboring Lithuania adopted a similar resolution in May and Estonia may follow suit in coming weeks, Kols said. Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova denounced the Latvian statement as a manifestation of ""xenophobia."" Sergei Tsekov, a member of the upper house of Russia's parliament, warned that Russia would take ""retaliatory measures that will show Latvia its place and will be quite painful."" That could include restrictions on transit, he said in remarks carried by state news agency RIA Novosti. The Baltic countries, which spent almost five decades under Soviet occupation, are among the staunchest supporters of Ukraine and the fiercest critics of the government of Russian President Vladimir Putin. Estonia decided Thursday to stop allowing Russian citizens entry with tourist visas starting Aug. 18.

Johnson, who is in his final weeks as prime minister, joined Treasury chief Nadhim Zahawi and Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng at the meeting with firms including Scottish Power, EDF and Centrica. But with Johnson insisting that ""significant fiscal decisions"" must be left to his successor, the talks produced no relief for Britons struggling with a cost-of-living crisis. Johnson said the government would ""keep urging the electricity sector to continue working on ways we can ease the cost of living pressures and to invest further and faster in British energy security."" There was a hint that the Conservative government could take action at some point. It said it ""continues to evaluate the extraordinary profits seen in certain parts of the electricity generation sector and the appropriate and proportionate steps to take."" Energy bills around the world have soared this year as the war in Ukraine squeezes global oil and gas supplies. The problem is especially acute in Britain, where the bills that people pay are governed by a regulator-set price cap linked to wholesale prices. The average U.K. household fuel bill has risen more than 50% this year, and another increase is due in October. Consulting firm Cornwall Insight forecast this week that the average bill will top 3,500 pounds ($4,300) a year in the fall, and rise above 4,000 pounds ($4,900) in the new year. Britain's Prime Minister Boris Johnson hosts a reception for the winners of the Points of Light Award in Downing Street, London, Tuesday Aug. 9, 2022. (Peter Nicholls/Pool via AP) Energy suppliers say the price increases are not their fault. ""This is not in the hands of energy retailers,"" Dale Vince, founder of the energy firm Ecotricity, told Sky News. ""The problem is the crazy price of gas on global commodity markets."" Anti-poverty campaigners say Britain is facing financial time bomb that could leave millions of people unable to heat their homes this winter. Johnson resigned as Conservative Party leader last month, and remains in office for a few more weeks as caretaker prime minister. The two candidates to replace him - Foreign Secretary Liz Truss and former Treasury chief Rishi Sunak - can´t act until one of them takes over as prime minister in September. Sunak - who earlier this year signed off on a 400 pound ($490) payment to offset fuel bills that all households will get this fall - has said he will offer more help, but has not given specifics. Truss says she prefers tax cuts to giving ""handouts,"" but also is facing intense pressure to help poor households. Opponents say by the time the new leader is announced on Sept. 5 and takes office the next day, it will be too late to avert an autumn crisis. Some want the U.K. to emulate France, where the government last month announced the nationalization of electricity giant EDF. Former Prime Minister Gordon Brown, who led the U.K. during the global financial crisis of 2008, said Britain was now in ""the eye of a cost-of-living storm"" and action couldn´t wait. Brown, a member of the opposition Labour Party, said the Conservative government should negotiate lower prices with energy firms, and suggested those that resisted could be temporarily nationalized. Writing in The Guardian, he said that crises ""don´t take holidays, and don´t politely hang fire - certainly not to suit the convenience of a departing PM and the whims of two potential successors."" ___ Follow all AP stories on the fallout from the war in Europe in https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine.

The burger giant closed its Ukrainian restaurants after Russia's invasion nearly six months ago but has continued to pay more than 10,000 McDonald's employees in the country. McDonald's said Thursday that it will begin gradually reopening some restaurants in the capital, Kyiv, and western Ukraine, where other companies are doing business away from the fighting. Western businesses like Nike, KFC and Spanish clothing retailer Mango are open in Kyiv. ""We´ve spoken extensively to our employees who have expressed a strong desire to return to work and see our restaurants in Ukraine reopen,"" Paul Pomroy, corporate senior vice president of international operated markets, said in a message to employees.

It´s the stiffest punitive step newly elected President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. could take against officials over an apparent irregularity early in his six-year term. He took office on June 30 after a landslide election victory and inherited daunting problems. Press Secretary Trixie Cruz-Angeles said a resolution authorizing the importation of 300,000 metric tons of sugar by the Sugar Regulatory Board, which Marcos Jr. heads, was posted on the website of the Sugar Regulatory Administration under the Department of Agriculture on Wednesday. Marcos Jr. has temporarily taken the helm of the Department of Agriculture due to a looming food crisis and skyrocketing commodity prices sparked in part by Russia´s invasion of Ukraine. Cruz-Angeles said the president never approved or was aware of the resolution to import sugar, which was signed by an agriculture undersecretary and other officials who are being investigated. The document was taken down from the website by Thursday. ""This resolution is illegal,"" she told a news conference. ""An investigation is ongoing to determine whether any acts that will cause the president to lose trust and confidence in his officials can be found or if there is malice or negligence involved.""

Officials dealing with sugar shortages and fast-rising prices, caused largely by the devastation of sugarcane fields, milling factories and refineries by a powerful typhoon in December, have opted to secure additional sugar imports to ease the crisis and prevent the country from running out of supplies. But Marcos Jr. rejected the proposal, Cruz-Angeles said, adding a decision to import sugar has to be studied to strike a balance between protecting consumers from rising prices while making sure ""that we do not destroy the local industry."" The harvest season will also come soon, she said. Marcos Jr. also inherited a pandemic-battered economy, lingering coronavirus threats, deep poverty, decades-long Muslim and communist insurgencies, law and order problems and political divisions inflamed by the recent elections."

Britain on Thursday announced that it will send more multiple launch rocket systems and guided missiles to Ukraine to help it resist Russia´s invasion. The new weapons, whose number wasn't specified, come on top of several rocket-launch systems it gave Ukraine earlier this year. Ukrainian troops have been trained in Britain to use them. ""Our continued support sends a very clear message, Britain and the international community remain opposed to this illegal war and will stand shoulder-to-shoulder, providing defensive military aid to Ukraine to help them defend against Putin´s invasion,"" Wallace, the defense chief, said. Before the conference, Denmark said it would give Ukraine an extra 820 million kroner ($113 million), which would bring Denmark´s total contribution to more than 3 billion kroner ($413 million). Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen called it ""a huge donation."" Part of the money will pay for 130 Danish troops to help train Ukrainian forces in Britain. Norwegian Defense Minister Bjørn Arild Gram said there was still unwavering Western support for Ukraine.

British Defense Secretary Ben Wallace said the bolstered military support shows the West ""will stand shoulder-to-shoulder, providing defensive military aid to Ukraine to help them defend against Putin´s invasion."" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, speaking by videoconference to the meeting of mostly northern European countries, pleaded for more aid. ""The sooner we stop Russia, the sooner we can feel safe,"" he said. Britain said Moscow was already strained by the need to produce armored fighting vehicles for its troops in Ukraine and hence ""is highly unlikely to be capable of fulfilling some export orders,"" in a sector it has long taken pride in. The British defense intelligence update, highlighting ""the increasing effect of Western sanctions,"" dovetails with Western belief that the series of measures imposed on the Kremlin since the Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine are increasingly having an impact on the Russian economy. The update said that because of the war and sanctions, ""its military industrial capacity is now under significant strain, and the credibility of many of its weapon systems has been undermined by their association with Russian forces' poor performance."" As the war nears the half-year point, Russia faces other challenges. Amid reports that hundreds of Russian soldiers were refusing to fight and trying to quit the military, covert recruitment efforts are underway that include using prisoners to make up for a shortage in trained troops. Russia's military credibility came under more pressure on Wednesday when Ukraine said nine Russian warplanes were destroyed following explosions at an air base in Russian-controlled Crimea that appeared to be the result of a Ukrainian attack. Russia denied any aircraft were damaged in the blasts - or that any attack took place. But satellite photos clearly showed at least seven fighter planes at the base had been blown up and others probably damaged. The U.K.'s Wallace dismissed Russian explanations of the blasts, including a wayward cigarette butt, as ""excuses."" ""When you just look at the footage of two simultaneous explosions not quite next to each other, and some of the reported damage even by the Russian authorities, I think it´s clear that that´s not something that happens by someone dropping a cigarette,"" the British minister said. Ukrainian forces mounting a broad counter-offensive in the south have recaptured 54 settlements in the Kherson region, overrun by Russia in the early days of the war, the governor said Thursday. Speaking on Ukrainian TV, Yaroslav Yanushevych also accused Moscow of shelling the areas it lost in retaliation, creating a ""catastrophic"" humanitarian situation in towns and villages along the region's northern boundary. The governor said 92% of the Kherson region remains under Russian occupation. In the east of the country, the Ukrainian military said it had repelled Russian attempts to advance on the city of Bakhmut, a key target of Moscow´s offensive in the Donetsk region. It also said Russian troops had tried and failed to break through Ukrainian defensive lines near the cities of Kramatorsk and Avdiivka, also in the Donetsk region. The military also reported Russian shelling of dozens of towns and villages in Ukraine´s north, south and east. In his nightly video address, Zelenskyy urged Ukrainians not to divulge details about the country's military operations. ""If you want victory for Ukraine, then that´s another matter, and you should feel your responsibility for every word you say about what our state is preparing in terms of defense or counter-offensives,"" he said. Russia, meanwhile, was taking apparent steps to strengthen its control over the eastern Luhansk region after driving out the last Ukrainian troops last month. Luhansk and Donetsk make up the Donbas, the industrial heartland. Dmitry Medvedev, the former Russian president, said he was joined on a visit to the region by Russia's top law enforcement and security officials and also the minister in charge of construction. Medvedev, in a post on a messaging app, said they met with local Kremlin-backed officials to discuss ""restoring infrastructure, repairing hospitals and preparing schools for the start of the school year, solving social problems and supporting civilians."" In other developments Thursday: - Burial services were held for 11 more unidentified bodies found in Bucha, the town outside the Ukrainian capital that saw hundreds of people slaughtered under Russian occupation early in the war. - The governments of Ukraine and Russia traded more accusations over which side was responsible for shelling the territory of the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant. U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres appealed to Moscow and Kyiv to stop military action around Europe´s largest nuclear plant to avoid a catastrophe. - The European Union's ban on coal imports from Russia took effect following a long phase-in that started in April. The 27-nation EU said it will affect about 25% of Russian coal exports and create a loss of about $8 billion a year. The EU is also trying to wean itself off Russian gas imports, but is too dependent to impose a full ban. - And in perhaps the most symbolic example of give and take on Thursday, McDonald´s announced plans to start reopening some of its restaurants in Ukraine in the coming months. The fast-food giant shuttered and sold hundreds of its Russian restaurants in March. Looking beyond a hoped-for return to peace, Scholz said Germany was working with the EU to develop plans for the reconstruction of Ukraine. ""That is going to be a big, big task which can hardly be described as a Marshall Plan,"" he said, referring to the massive U.S. aid plan for Europe in the wake of World War II. ""It´s bigger."" ___ Follow AP´s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine Workers take from a refrigerator truck and put into a coffin a body of unidentified civilian murdered by the Russian troops during Russian occupation in Bucha, on the outskirts of Kyiv, Ukraine, Thursday, Aug. 11, 2022.

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-11101769/Gas-prices-dip-just-4-time-5-months.html,2022-08-11,Gas prices dip just below $4 for the first time in 5 months,"Gasoline prices have dipped under $4 for the first time in more than five months - good news for consumers who are struggling with high prices for many other essentials. AAA said the national average for a gallon of regular was $3.99 on Thursday, down from the mid-June record of $5.02. However, that´s still about 80 cents higher than the average a year ago. Energy is a key factor in the cost of many goods and services, and falling prices for gas, airline tickets and clothes are giving consumers a bit of relief, although inflation is still close to a four-decade high. Glen Smith, a for-hire driver, sized up the price - $3.85 a gallon - while waiting between rides at a gas station in Kenner, Louisiana. ""I´m not tickled pink, but I´m happier it´s less than what it was,"" Smith said. ""There for a while, every two days I put $50 of gas in my car. It´s $12 to run from the airport to drop off in the city -- $12 a trip!"" Oil prices began rising in mid-2020 as economies recovered from the initial shock of the pandemic. They rose again when the U.S. and allies announced sanctions against Russian oil over the country's war against Ukraine. FILE - A motorist fills up the tank on a sedan, on July 22, 2022, in Saratoga, Wyo. Gasoline prices are sliding back toward the $4 mark for the first time in more than five months - good news for consumers who are struggling with high prices for many other essentials. (AP Photo/David Zalubowski, File) Recently, however, oil prices have dropped on concern about slowing economic growth around the world. U.S. benchmark crude oil has recently dipped close to $90 a barrel from over $120 a barrel in June. It is unclear whether gasoline prices got so high that consumers cut back on their driving. Some experts believe that is true, although they acknowledge that the evidence is largely anecdotal. ""I don't know that $5 was the magic amount. I think it was the amount of increase in a short period of time,"" said Peter Schwarz, an expert on energy pricing and an economics professor at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. ""People were starting to watch their driving."" Schwarz expects oil prices to remain relatively stable at least for the next month or so, particularly after OPEC and partners including Russia agreed to only a small oil production increase in September, which won't be enough to drive prices lower. Christian vom Lehn, an economics professor at Brigham Young University, said the price of oil is the key factor for gasoline, but that seasonal trends could also keep prices from surging again. ""We are coming to the end of summer, and summer is a peak travel season, so demand is naturally going to fall,"" he said. ""That is certainly contributing to the most recent decline"" in gas prices. The average gas price has dropped 58 straight days, but that streak will end soon, predicted Tom Kloza, head of energy analysis at the Oil Price Information Service. He said the industry will face challenges to meet gasoline demand for the rest of the year. Kloza noted that it's still early in the hurricane season, which in the past has shut down some of the nation's biggest refineries that sit in hurricane-prone areas of the Gulf Coast; the Gulf of Mexico is speckled with oil-producing platforms. Also, he said, ""refinery runs will come down because of a lot of delayed maintenance that can´t be delayed indefinitely."" Prices at the pump are likely to be a major issue heading into the mid-term elections in November. Republicans blame President Joe Biden for the high gasoline prices, seizing on his decisions to cancel a permit for a major pipeline and suspend new oil and gas leases on federal lands. Biden touted the sub-$4 gas on Thursday. ""That's over one dollar down from peak prices,"" he tweeted. ""And I´m not done calling on oil producers to increase global supply so prices can drop even more."" Biden has previously targeted the oil companies, accusing them of not producing as much energy as they could while posting huge profits. ""Exxon made more money than God this year,"" he said in June. Exxon said it has increased oil production. The CEO of Chevron said Biden was trying to vilify his industry. Biden has also ordered the release of oil from the nation´s strategic petroleum reserve this year. While not large enough to account for the drop in gasoline prices, the extra supply from reserves might have helped stem the rise in pump prices, according to analysts. The nationwide average for gas hasn't been under $4 since early March. Prices topped out at $5.02 a gallon on June 14, according to AAA. They declined slowly the rest of June, then began dropping more rapidly. The shopping app GasBuddy reported that the national average dropped under $4 on Tuesday. Motorists in California and Hawaii are still paying above $5, and other states in the West are paying close to that. The cheapest gas is in Texas and several other states in the South and Midwest. A year ago, the nationwide average price was just under $3.19 a gallon, according to AAA. After a long climb, that price has dropped steadily this summer, falling 15 cents in the past week and 69 cents in the last month, ""If you talk to people who are not economists, gas prices always go up faster than they come down,"" said Schwarz, the energy-pricing expert. ""These are still high gas prices."" ___ Stephen Smith in Kenner, Louisiana, contributed to this report. A customer pumps gas at an Exxon gas station, Tuesday, May 10, 2022, in Miami.

Instead, men in uniform arrived and offered them amnesty - if they agreed to fight alongside the Russian army in Ukraine. Over the following days, about a dozen or so left the prison, according to a woman whose boyfriend is serving a sentence there. Speaking on condition of anonymity because she feared reprisals, she said her boyfriend wasn't among the volunteers, although with years left on his sentence, he ""couldn't not think about it."" As Russia continues to suffer losses in its invasion of Ukraine, now nearing its sixth month, the Kremlin has refused to announce a full-blown mobilization - a move that could be very unpopular for President Vladimir Putin. That has led instead to a covert recruitment effort that includes using prisoners to make up the manpower shortage. This also is happening amid reports that hundreds of Russian soldiers are refusing to fight and trying to quit the military. ""We´re seeing a huge outflow of people who want to leave the war zone - those who have been serving for a long time and those who have signed a contract just recently,"" said Alexei Tabalov, a lawyer who runs the Conscript´s School legal aid group. The group has seen an influx of requests from men who want to terminate their contracts, ""and I personally get the impression that everyone who can is ready to run away,"" Tabalov said in an interview with The Associated Press. ""And the Defense Ministry is digging deep to find those it can persuade to serve.""

That has led instead to a covert recruitment effort that includes trying to get prisoners to make up for the manpower shortage. This photo was taken during a trip organized by the Russian Ministry of Defense. (AP Photo, File) Although the Defense Ministry denies that any ""mobilization activities"" are taking place, authorities seem to be pulling out all the stops to bolster enlistment. Billboards and public transit ads in various regions proclaim, ""This is The Job,"" urging men to join the professional army. Authorities have set up mobile recruiting centers in some cities, including one at the site of a half marathon in Siberia in May. Regional administrations are forming ""volunteer battalions"" that are promoted on state television. The business daily Kommersant counted at least 40 such entities in 20 regions, with officials promising volunteers monthly salaries ranging from the equivalent of $2,150 to nearly $5,500, plus bonuses. The AP saw thousands of openings on job search websites for various military specialists. The British military said this week that Russia had formed a major new ground force called the 3rd Army Corps from ""volunteer battalions,"" seeking men up to age 50 and requiring only a middle-school education, while offering ""lucrative cash bonuses"" once they are deployed to Ukraine. But complaints also are surfacing in the media that some aren´t getting their promised payments, although those reports can't be independently verified. In early August, Tabalov said he began receiving multiple requests for legal help from reservists who have been ordered to take part in a two-month training in areas near the border with Ukraine. The recruitment of prisoners has been going on in recent weeks in as many as seven regions, said Vladimir Osechkin, founder of the Gulagu.net prisoner rights group, citing inmates and their relatives that his group had contacted. It's not the first time that authorities have used such a tactic, with the Soviet Union employing ""prisoner battalions"" during World War II. Nor is Russia alone. Early in the war, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy promised amnesty to military veterans behind bars if they volunteered to fight, although it remains unclear if anything came out of it. In the current circumstances, Osechkin said, it isn't the Defense Ministry that's recruiting prisoners - instead, it was Russia´s shadowy private military force, the Wagner Group. Yevgeny Prigozhin, an entrepreneur known as ""Putin´s chef"" because of his catering contracts with the Kremlin and reportedly Wagner's manager and financier, brushed aside reports that he personally visited prisons to recruit convicts, in a written statement released by his representatives this month. Prigozhin, in fact, denies he has any ties to Wagner, which reportedly has sent military contractors to places like Syria and sub-Saharan Africa. According to Osechkin, prisoners with military or law enforcement experience were initially offered to go to Ukraine, but that later was extended to inmates with varying backgrounds. He estimated that as of late July, about 1,500 might have applied, lured by promises of big salaries and eventual pardons. Now, he added, many of those volunteers - or their families - are contacting him and seeking to get out of their commitments, telling him: ""I really don´t want to go."" According to the woman whose boyfriend is serving his sentence at the penal colony in St. Petersburg, the offers to leave the prison are ""a glimmer of hope"" for freedom. But she said he told her that of 11 volunteers, eight died in Ukraine. She added that one of the volunteers expressed regret for his decision and doesn´t believe he will return alive. Her account couldn't be independently verified, but was in line with multiple reports by independent Russian media and human rights groups. According to those groups and military lawyers, some soldiers and law enforcement officers have refused deployment to Ukraine or are trying to return home after a few weeks or months of fighting. Media reports about some troops refusing to fight in Ukraine started surfacing in the spring, but rights groups and lawyers only began talking about the number of refusals reaching the hundreds last month. In mid-July, the Free Buryatia Foundation reported that about 150 men were able to terminate their contracts with the Defense Ministry and returned from Ukraine to Buryatia, a region in eastern Siberia that borders Mongolia. Some of the servicemen are facing repercussions. Tabalov, the legal aid lawyer, said about 80 other soldiers who sought to nullify their contracts were detained in the Russian-controlled town of Bryanka in the Luhansk region of eastern Ukraine, according to their relatives. Last week, he said that the Bryanka detention center was shut down because of the media attention. But the parent of one officer who was detained after trying to get out of his contract told the AP this week that some are still being detained elsewhere in the region. The parent asked not to be identified out of safety concerns. Tabalov said a serviceman can terminate his contract for a compelling reason - normally not difficult - although the decision is usually up to his commander. But he added: ""In the conditions of hostilities, not a single commander would acknowledge anything like that, because where would they find people to fight?"" Alexandra Garmazhapova, head of the Free Buryatia Foundation, told the AP that soldiers and their relatives complain of commanders tearing up termination notices and threatening ""refuseniks"" with prosecution. As of late July, the foundation said it had received hundreds of requests from soldiers seeking to end their contracts. ""I´m getting messages every day,"" Garmazhapova said. Tabalov said some soldiers complain that they were deceived about where they were going and didn´t expect to end up in a war zone, while others are exhausted from fighting and unable to continue. Rarely, if at all, did they appear motivated by antiwar convictions, the lawyer said. Russia will continue to face problems with soldiers refusing to fight, military analyst Michael Kofman said, but one shouldn't underestimate Russia's ability to ""muddle through ... with half-measures."" ""They´re going to have a lot of people who are quitting or have people who basically don´t want to deploy,"" said Kofman, director of the Virginia-based Russia Studies Program at the Center for Naval Analyses, on a recent podcast. ""And they´ve employed a lot of measures to try to keep people in line. But ultimately, there´s not that much that they can do."" ___ Follow AP's coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine FILE - Russian soldiers talk to each other near an apartment building damaged during fighting between Russian and Ukrainian forces in Severodonetsk, on the territory which is under the Government of the Luhansk People's Republic control, eastern Ukraine, Tuesday, July 12, 2022.

However, the need to focus on those issues is now even more pressing. FILE - James Hetfield of Metallica performs at the Lollapalooza Music Festival in Chicago on July 28, 2022.

(Photo by Amy Harris/Invision/AP, File) ""If we are going to do something about that, then we need urgent mobilization,"" Chopra Jonas told The Associated Press. ""So just seeing all of these people from different stretches of society, different professions - regular folks coming together, motivated to actually make change now in an urgent way - is just so inspiring."" As with all Global Citizen events, tickets to the concerts are free. However, to get the tickets, people must join Global Citizen and take action on a series of the campaign´s issues. Pop star Charlie Puth, Latin sensation Rosalia, country star Mickey Guyton and Italian rockers Maneskin are also on the Central Park bill, while rapper Stormzy, Nigerian singer-songwriter Tems and Ghanian stars Gyakie, Sarkodie and Stonebwoy will also perform in Accra. Both concerts will be broadcast and streamed on ABC, ABC News Live, FX, Hulu, iHeartRadio, Twitter, YouTube, and other outlets. ABC will broadcast a primetime special, ""Global Citizen Festival: Take Action NOW,"" from the shows on Sept. 25. Global Citizen says it hopes to use the platform provided by the concerts to encourage fans to ask for specific changes from government, business and philanthropy leaders. Evans wants to convince Scandinavian countries, as well as Ireland, Portugal, and others, to transfer their Special Drawing Rights in the International Monetary Fund, which provide access to about $100 billion in affordable financing, to low-income countries, especially in Africa, to lower their debt repayments. In addition to asking the United States to donate more toward fighting climate change, he also wants about $500 million in donations and grants for farmers in Africa so they can grow more crops, rather than depending on wheat and fertilizer from Ukraine and Russia, which have both in short supply due to the war. ""We also need to address the reality that supporting women and girls around the world and their talents are the closest we have to a silver bullet for the eradication of poverty,"" Evans said. ""We´re calling on the wealthiest nations to provide $600 million dollars in critical investments into education, sexual and reproductive health and economic empowerment for them."" Global Citizen´s formula for using social media and its followers´ interest to convince corporations and foundations to donate has worked. Since its first Global Citizen Festival in 2012, the advocacy organization estimates that it has helped direct $41.4 billion to its causes and improved the lives of more than 1.15 billion people. ""These are urgent issues,"" Evans said. ""That´s why our campaigns focus on ending extreme poverty now - not next year, not the year after, but right now. We have to address the issues that matter most, whether it´s gender equality, climate change, or the structural issues that keep people poor."" ____ Associated Press coverage of philanthropy and nonprofits receives support through the AP´s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-11100515/Key-center-expects-big-uptick-Ukraine-grain-shipments.html,2022-08-10,Key center expects `big uptick' in Ukraine grain shipments,"The center coordinating shipping of desperately needed grain to world markets from Ukraine expects ""a big uptick"" in applications to pick up cargoes at Ukrainian ports in the near future, its interim coordinator said Wednesday. Frederick Kenney told a virtual news conference from Istanbul, where the Joint Coordination Center is located, that ship owners have shown ""tremendous interest"" in exporting grain from Ukraine -- one of the world´s key breadbaskets -- under the recent deal aimed at helping ease the global food crisis sparked by Russia´s Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine. The center is receiving ""literally dozens and dozens of phone calls every day and emails asking when can we get ready to go,"" said Kenney, director of legal and external affairs at the International Maritime Organization and a retired U.S. Coast Guard rear admiral and judge advocate who is leading the U.N.´s efforts at the center to get grain shipped from three Ukrainian ports. He said detailed procedures on shipping and inspections were sent out to the industry on Monday and their dissemination ""is also going to drive a surge in requests, but it is early days."" ""We´re expecting to see a big uptick in applications for transit,"" Kenney said. ""Indeed, we´re aware that there are a number of empty grain vessels sitting at anchorage in Turkish anchorage areas waiting to arrange the contracts. And once they have their deals arranged they´ll be transiting northbound."" Ukraine signed an agreement with Turkey and the U.N. on July 22 clearing the way for Ukraine to export 22 million tons of corn and other grain stuck at ports and in silos since the Russian invasion, and to make room for the export of the upcoming harvest. A separate memorandum between Russia and the U.N. signed the same day is aimed at clearing roadblocks to its shipments of food and fertilizer to world markets. The Joint Coordination Center, which includes experts from Russia, Ukraine, Turkey and the U.N., has so far authorized the departure of 12 vessels carrying over 370,000 metric tons of grain, mainly corn, and other foodstuffs and the arrival of four vessels to pick up new cargo, Kenney said. He said its inspectors on Wednesday inspected three outbound ships and two inbound vessels -- the most since the signing -- for non-food items and unauthorized personnel. Ukraine´s Infrastructure Ministry published video footage Wednesday showing the Osprey S ship arriving at the port of Chornomorsk to be loaded with 30,000 metric tons of grain. It was the second arriving at the port under the deal. Kenney said nothing unauthorized has been found in inspections so far, no floating mines have been encountered in the Black Sea shipping corridor, and the technical expertise of the four parties working at the center is ""great"" and really diverse. Asked about relations among the parties, since Russia and Ukraine are at war, he said, ""I´ve been extremely impressed with the level of cooperation and coordination that has been displayed."" U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres first raised the critical need to restart the supply of Ukraine´s agricultural production and Russia´s grain and fertilizer to world markets in late April during meetings with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow and Ukraine´s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Kyiv. He then proposed a deal, pointing to fear that the war could worsen hunger for up to 181 million people, especially in poorer developing countries. Asked about the initial shipments of Ukrainian corn going mainly to countries not in desperate need of food, Kenney said it´s crucial to get ships stuck in Ukrainian ports since Feb. 24 moving out so ships can be brought in to load cargoes ""that will be destined for ports that will contribute to reducing world food insecurity."" ""But really, any ship that goes out is going to help the situation,"" he said."

The second in a planned series of protests under the slogan #GAZwithme took place in front of the presidential building in Sofia and organizers said they want greater accountability from the caretaker cabinet. Many in European Union and NATO member Bulgaria fear that the previous, pro-Western government was toppled in June because of its hard stance against Russia´s invasion of Ukraine and its refusal to pay Russian energy giant Gazprom in rubles, Russia's currency. In late April, Russia cut off gas supplies to Bulgaria, the EU´s poorest nation, after it rejected Moscow's demand to pay in rubles. Relations between the two former Soviet bloc allies tanked under the previous government. The first public statements by the current caretaker government, appointed by President Rumen Radev, indicate that Bulgaria could restart talks with Gazprom to avoid natural gas shortages later in the year. ""We refuse to be dependent on Gazprom and finance Putin´s outrageous war!"" read one of the banners at the protest.

(AP Photo/Valentina Petrova) Atanas Sharkov, one of the protest organizers, called on Radev, who bears direct responsibility for the actions of the caretaker government, to guarantee that previous decisions will not be revised. He insisted that Gazprom must cease to be Bulgaria´s only gas supplier. ""It is high time to follow European policies and be part of Europe,"" Sharkov said. Last month, the leaders of Greece and Bulgaria marked the completion of a new pipeline that will supply natural gas from Azerbaijan to Bulgaria. They said commercial deliveries are expected to start by Oct. 1.

Several hundred troops arrived home Tuesday to Fort Stewart, where cheering parents, spouses and children welcomed them with waving flags and homemade signs. Members of the 1st Armored Brigade of the Army's 3rd Infantry Division found themselves scrambling to deploy in early March, barely a week after Russian troops invaded Ukraine. The soldiers from Georgia went to Germany to train alongside NATO allies in a show of force intended to deter further Russian aggression in Europe. Spc. David King had to leave his wife and 2-year-old daughter with less than two days of advance notice. Both were waiting when he returned to Fort Stewart. ""I was a little worried that stuff was going to get crazy,"" Kyra King, the soldier's wife, told the Savannah Morning News. ""But he stayed safe."" Fort Stewart commanders say the rest of the 1st Brigade should be home by the end of August. The U.S. military is sending another unit to take its place - the 3rd Armored Brigade of the 1st Cavalry Division based at Fort Hood, Texas."

The band is debuting songs from the second half of ""Mercury,"" a double album of brooding and moody meditations on death and human frailty. Reynolds relives the pain at every show. ""I don´t know how to perform without going to the place that I was when I wrote the song,"" he says. ""When I get up on the stage, it´s `OK, the song is playing. Where was I? What was I feeling? Now let me emote that.' That´s a lot to emotionally go through every other night."" Integrating the new songs into a seamless, fun night out for fans has also been a challenge, with the band needing to somehow fit hits like ""Radioactive"" and ""Believer"" with songs like ""Wrecked,"" which Reynolds wrote about losing his sister-in-law to cancer. One solution was to break out some of the songs from ""Mercury"" and halfway through the concert play four or five of them acoustically, in a stripped-down, intimate way on a secondary stage. ""It was really hard to find the momentum and to do it correctly,"" Reynolds says. ""How do we go from empowering to happy and then happy to angry? There´s so much emotional baggage with Imagine Dragons."" FILE - Dan Reynolds, of Imagine Dragons, performs at iHeartRadio ALTer EGO in Inglewood, Calif., on Jan. 15, 2022.

(AP Photo/Chris Pizzello, File) Fans will find out as the tour winds through such states as Pennsylvania, Virginia, New Jersey, Massachusetts, Michigan, Illinois, Ohio, Georgia, Texas, Colorado, California and Nevada. The songs on ""Mercury"" reflect a tumultuous few years for Reynolds. ""The main takeaways were death played a huge role in my life during those five years the records were written,"" he says. In addition to his sister-in-law, Reynolds lost his business manager, an ex-girlfriend and his best friend. ""It makes you question everything,"" he says. Such blows could make anyone wonder what's the point in anything. For Reynolds it was the opposite: ""Every moment is so meaningful. Every relationship. The present moment right now matters."" The album was named ""Mercury"" after the reflectiveness and chromatic beauty of the element. ""When I looked at mercury, it felt reflective in that way, that it was like beautiful but also volatile at times,"" he says. ""I really feel like `Mercury´ at its core is a very self-reflective record."" Sam Riback, executive vice president and co-head of A&R at Interscope Geffen A&M, agrees: ""I think this is obviously Dan and the band´s most personal work to date,"" he says. ""There were so many great songs that they had generated over a large time period and they wanted to make sure that their fan base got to experience all the stories they were telling."" Unlike this spring's European leg, Reynolds will be leaving his four kids at his home in Las Vegas for the North American tour, which kicked off in Salt Lake City. He laughs good-naturedly at some harrowing dad moments from a few months ago. ""It´s been a traveling circus. It has been really difficult. Lots of throwing up on long winding roads with kids and screaming kids in airplanes and getting in at 4 a.m. from a show and kids jumping on you at 6 a.m. But I survived."" Imagine Dragons - which includes guitarist Wayne Sermon, bassist Ben McKee and drummer Daniel Platzman - just celebrated being the first band in history to have four certified diamond singles - each reaching 10 million or more in sales and stream equivalents in the United States. A stunned Reynolds calls it ""funny numbers."" ""I honestly have realized in my life that I have no ability to have true perspective on any of this,"" he says. ""This is so mind boggling to me. Maybe there´s some people who can wrap their heads around this. I have no ability to. I hear that I´m like, `Wow. I don´t even know what that means fully.´"" The latest single to cross the diamond threshold is ""Thunder"" from 2017's album ""Evolve."" Reynolds marvels at its humble roots: He wrote and recorded the vocals over two hours in his house in Las Vegas, even manipulating his voice to a crazy pitch in parts that were included in the final song. ""If you listen closely with headphones, you can hear screaming kids in the background,"" he says. On a wider scale, Imagine Dragons have always had a social impact apart from their music, raising money and awareness in support of causes like LGBTQ+ rights, the fight against pediatric cancer and the empowerment of women. They've recently added Ukraine to their list of concerns. The band performed at the Save Ukraine telethon and during the European tour, Reynolds was rarely seen without the Ukrainian flag, dedicating songs to the country. Imagine Dragons are huge in Ukraine and sold out the Olympic Stadium in Kyiv in 2018. Reynolds has also been working with a team in Ukraine on a video game. Reynolds recently spoke with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy over Zoom - a meeting he calls ""the honor of a lifetime"" - and has joined a fundraiser for new ambulances to replace those lost in combat with Russia. ""My main takeaway from our meeting was just they need help. They need help,"" he says. ""Our headlines are so quick to move on to meaningless things when we´re in the year 2022 and there´s a war and there´s kids being killed. There is truly a culture and a country being destroyed."" Adding Ukraine to Reynold's list of activist causes is part of the obligation he feels as a public figure. It's also personal, like his work for the Tyler Robinson Foundation - inspired by meeting the pediatric cancer patient. ""My mantra has been `Go just exactly where your heart takes you, the path of least resistance.´ You can´t do everything. You can´t solve everything. So you go where your life takes,"" he says. ___ Mark Kennedy is at http://twitter.com/KennedyTwits ___ For more AP entertainment news, go to https://apnews.com/hub/entertainment"

Sweden-based H&M and Netherlands-based IKEA had paused sales in Russia after the military operation began and are now looking to unload their stocks of clothing and furnishings as they wind down operations there, saying the future is unpredictable. IKEA´s sales are online only, while the H&M store at the Moscow shopping mall Aviapark saw a steady stream of young shoppers Tuesday. The racks and shelves were well stocked in the clothing retailer. Nearby shops were closed, including Zara, Oysho, Bershka, Pull&Bear and Uniqlo, while New Yorker, Finn Flare, Marks & Spencer and Mango were open. ""I will start looking at Russian brands,"" one H&M shopper, who gave only her first name Anya, said after emerging from the store. Another shopper, who only gave his name as Leonid, said he was ""very hurt"" that H&M is closing down: ""A good store is leaving."" Both companies are laying off staffers as they scale down business in Russia. H&M said Tuesday that 6,000 workers will be affected and that it was working on details of offering continued support in the coming months. IKEA said in June that many workers will lose their jobs and it has guaranteed six months of pay for them, as well as core benefits. It said this week that it has 15,000 workers in Russia and Belarus, but it did not immediately confirm how many would be laid off.

(AP Photo/Alexander Zemlianichenko) ""We are deeply saddened about the impact this will have on our colleagues and very grateful for all their hard work and dedication,"" H&M Group CEO Helena Helmersson said last month. Many Western companies promised to leave Russia after it sent troops into Ukraine, taking months to wind down operations and often selling holdings to Russian firms. McDonald´s sold its 850 restaurants to a Russian franchisee owner, who is moving to reopen them under the name Vkusno-i Tochka. British energy giants Shell and BP are taking billions of dollars in charges to exit investments and holdings in Russia. Meanwhile, some Western companies have remained in Russia or are partially operating. French-owned home improvement retailer Leroy Merlin has kept open its 112 stores in Russia, for example, while PepsiCo, Nestle and drugmaker Johnson & Johnson are supplying essentials like medications and baby formula while halting nonessential sales. H&M said it expects costs from leaving Russia to reach about 2 billion Swedish kronor ($197 million), which will be included as one-time costs in its third-quarter earnings this year. IKEA said in June that it will start looking for new owners for its four factories in Russia and will close its purchase and logistics offices in Moscow and Minsk, Belarus, a key Russian ally. Russian President Vladimir Putin has pushed for years to develop and deploy Russian substitute goods and services to make up for the loss of Western imports, which has taken on new urgency as companies like H&M and IKEA wind down operations.

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-11098761/Austin-pledges-military-training-support-Baltics.html,2022-08-10,"Austin pledges military training, support for Baltics","The U.S. will conduct more military exercises with Baltic nations such as Latvia, and look to provide increased training, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said Wednesday, saying the U.S. may bring in additional troops from America if needed to bolster the region against any possible threat from Russia. Speaking at a press conference with Latvia´s Defense Minister Artis Pabriks, Austin said plans to do continuous rotations of forces into the Baltics will likely use troops from U.S. brigades in Romania and other parts of Europe, but ""we can also bring in forces from the United States."" Austin is the first U.S. defense secretary to visit Latvia in nearly three decades, underscoring the increased importance of the Baltic nations, who sit at Russia´s western edge. They have watched Russia's invasion of Ukraine and fear that they could be the next victims of Moscow´s aggression. The Pentagon said the last defense chief to go to Latvia was William Perry in 1995. Pabriks told reporters that his top priorities are to get more U.S. military enablers, adding that in order to defend his country, his troops need ""nitty gritty training"" on a daily basis. He added that Latvia also needs additional financial assistance from the U.S. in order to buy new military equipment, and to beef up its air defense and coastal defense. In two days of meetings in this Baltic capital, just a few hours´ drive from the Russian border, Austin repeatedly re-enforced America's commitment to helping the region defend itself. He met with U.S. troops on Tuesday, including members of the Security Force Assistance Brigade that provides training to allies. He said Wednesday that he is looking to maintain use of the SFAB in the Baltic region going forward. Austin's visit comes as the Russian war in Ukraine is in its sixth month, as Russia continues to make slow but incremental progress but has met growing counterattacks by Ukrainian forces in Russian-occupied areas of southern Ukraine. Ukraine has also been battling to hold off the Kremlin´s forces in the industrial Donbas region in the east. U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin, left, and Latvian Minister of Defence Artis Pabriks shake hands during the press conference in Riga, Latvia, Wednesday, Aug. 10, 2022. (AP Photo/Roman Koksarov) In a possible escalation of the fighting, powerful explosions rocked a Russian air base in Crimea on Tuesday and sent towering clouds of smoke over the landscape. Russia´s Defense Ministry denied the Saki base on the Black Sea had been shelled and said instead that munitions had blown up there. But Ukrainian social networks were abuzz with speculation that it was hit by Ukrainian-fired long-range missiles. In a rapid-fire series of meetings on Wednesday with top Latvian leaders, including President Egils Levits at Riga Castle, Austin pledged America´s steadfast commitment to stand with the Baltic region against any Russian aggression. The three Baltic nations - Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia - are all former Soviet republics, and were seized and annexed by Josef Stalin during World War II . They gained independence with the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991, and joined NATO in 2004, putting themselves under the military protection of the U.S. and its Western allies. ""We will enhance our rotational deployments in the region and intensify our training with our Baltic allies to further strengthen our combat credible posture in the region,"" Austin said, as the start of his meeting with Latvian Prime Minister Arturs Krisjanis Karins at the Council of Ministers on Wednesday morning. During the press conference, Pabriks acknowledged worries about the threat from neighboring Belarus, which is a Russian ally. He said he doesn´t consider Belarus an independent nation and is instead just part of Russia. He said Latvia is routinely concerned about the threat along that border and watches it closely. The U.S. has deployed an additional 20,000 U.S. troops to Europe -- for a total of about 100,000 --- in order to reassure NATO allies, beef up training and exercises and shift the focus of the forces to the alliance´s eastern flank. Of those, the U.S. now has about 500 troops in Latvia, an increase over the 100 that were in the country as of last December. In March, shortly after Russia´s invasion of Ukraine, NATO began to explore how best to shore up the defense of the eastern flank, from Estonia in the north through Latvia, Lithuania and Poland down to Bulgaria and Romania on the Black Sea. ""On land, our new posture should include substantially more forces in the eastern part of the Alliance, at higher readiness, with more prepositioned equipment and supplies,"" said NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg, at the time. ""In the air, more allied air power, and strengthened integrated air and missile defense."" Austin first stopped first at Lielvarde Air Base where he and Pabriks met with U.S. and Latvian troops. Standing in a hangar in front of an Apache helicopter, Pabriks flatly told Austin and the service members that ""if something happens on the border - we are ready to die."" Austin assured Pabriks and the troops that ""if something happens, and ... the sovereign territory of Latvia is questioned or challenged, we´re gonna be here to work with our partners."" NATO only began stationing troops on its eastern flank after Russia annexed Ukraine´s Crimean Peninsula in 2014. Until late last year, only around 5,000 troops were deployed in the Baltic states and Poland on a rotational basis. Now, NATO says, hundreds of thousands of troops are on heightened alert, with America's 100,000 troops in Europe, and 40,000 troops under direct NATO command, supported by around 150 ships and a similar number of aircraft. Austin's visit also comes as Latvia moves to increase its own defenses, and the nation's president eyes a plan to reinstate national conscription for men, and for women on a voluntary basis. The draft could be reintroduced next year after a hiatus of over 15 years. Latvian Prime Minister Krisjanis Karins said the country was working closely with the U.S. and boosting its defense budget in response to the looming Russian threat. ""Now that Russia is waging a brutal war in Ukraine, the U.S. and we are united, working on strengthening NATO and providing support to Ukraine,"" Karins said, in comments published by the Baltic News Service, the region´s main news agency. ___ Associated Press reporter Jan M.

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-11098759/Ukraine-says-9-Russian-warplanes-destroyed-Crimea-blasts.html,2022-08-10,Ukraine says 9 Russian warplanes destroyed in Crimea blasts,"Ukraine said Wednesday that nine Russian warplanes were destroyed in a deadly string of explosions at an air base in Crimea that appeared to be the result of a Ukrainian attack, which would represent a significant escalation in the war. Russia denied any aircraft were damaged in Tuesday's blasts - or that any attack took place. But satellite photos clearly showed at least seven fighter planes at the base had been blown up and others probably damaged. Ukrainian officials stopped short of publicly claiming responsibility for the explosions, while mocking Russia´s explanation that a careless smoker might have caused ammunition at the Saki air base to catch fire and blow up. Analysts also said that explanation doesn´t make sense and that the Ukrainians could have used anti-ship missiles to strike the base. If Ukrainian forces were, in fact, responsible for the blasts, it would be the first known major attack on a Russian military site on the Crimean Peninsula, which was seized from Ukraine by the Kremlin in 2014. Russian warplanes have used Saki to strike areas in Ukraine´s south. Crimea holds huge strategic and symbolic significance for both sides. The Kremlin´s demand that Ukraine recognize Crimea as part of Russia has been one of its key conditions for ending the fighting, while Ukraine has vowed to drive the Russians from the peninsula and all other occupied territories. The explosions, which killed one person and wounded 14, sent tourists fleeing in panic as plumes of smoke rose over the coastline nearby. Video showed shattered windows and holes in the brickwork of some buildings. A satellite image by Planet Labs PBC shows Saki Air Base after an explosion there Wednesday, Aug. 10, 2022, in the Crimean Peninsula, the Black Sea peninsula seized from Ukraine by Russia and annexed in March 2014. Ukraine said Wednesday that nine Russian warplanes were destroyed in a deadly string of explosions at an air base in Crimea that appeared to be the result of a Ukrainian attack, which would represent a significant escalation in the war. (Planet Labs PBC via AP) One tourist, Natalia Lipovaya, said that ""the earth was gone from under my feet"" after the powerful blasts. ""I was so scared,"" she said. Sergey Milochinsky, a local resident, recalled hearing a roar and seeing a mushroom cloud from his window. ""Everything began to fall around, collapse,"" he said. Crimea´s regional leader, Sergei Aksyonov, said some 250 residents were moved to temporary housing after dozens of apartment buildings were damaged. Russian authorities sought to downplay the explosions, saying Wednesday that all hotels and beaches were unaffected on the peninsula, which is a popular tourist destination for many Russians. But video posted on social media showed long lines of slowly moving cars on the road to Russia as tourists headed for home. A Ukrainian presidential adviser, Oleksiy Arestovych, cryptically said that the blasts were either caused by Ukrainian-made long-range weapons or the work of Ukrainian guerrillas operating in Crimea. A Ukrainian parliament member, Oleksandr Zavitnevich, said the airfield was rendered unusable. He reported on Facebook that it housed fighter jets, tactical reconnaissance aircraft and military transport planes. Satellite images from Planet Labs PBC taken at midafternoon Wednesday showed some 2 square kilometers (0.75 square mile) of grassland burned at the Saki base. Several craters marked the ground near the tarmac - typically the sign of a powerful explosion. The two runways bore no apparent damage and appeared to still be operational. Some of the fighter jets on the flight line had been moved farther down the runway, compared to images taken Tuesday before the blast. The base has been home to the Russian 43rd Independent Naval Assault Air Squadron since Moscow seized Crimea. The squadron flies Sukhoi Su-24s and Sukhoi Su-30s. The base also includes a number of earth-covered bunkers and hangars around its periphery - typically used to house munitions in case of a fire. None appeared damaged. ""Official Kyiv has kept mum about it, but unofficially the military acknowledges that it was a Ukrainian strike,"" Ukrainian military analyst Oleh Zhdanov said. The base is at least 200 kilometers (about 125 miles) from the closest Ukrainian position. Zhdanov suggested that Ukrainian forces could have struck it with Ukrainian or Western-supplied anti-ship missiles that have the necessary range. The Washington-based Institute for the Study of War said it couldn´t independently determine what caused the explosions but noted that simultaneous blasts in two places at the base probably rule out an accidental fire but not sabotage or a missile attack. It added: ""The Kremlin has little incentive to accuse Ukraine of conducting strikes that caused the damage since such strikes would demonstrate the ineffectiveness of Russian air defense systems."" During the war, the Kremlin has reported numerous fires and explosions on Russian territory near the Ukrainian border, blaming some of them on Ukrainian strikes. Ukrainian authorities have mostly kept silent about the incidents, preferring to keep the world guessing. Neither side has released much information about their own casualties. In his nightly video address Wednesday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy claimed nearly 43,000 Russian soldiers had been killed. Colin Kahl, U.S. undersecretary of defense for policy, estimated Monday that Russian forces have sustained up to 80,000 deaths and injuries in the fighting. He did not break down the figure with an estimate of forces killed or provide a Ukrainian casualty count. In other developments, Russian forces shelled areas across Ukraine on Tuesday night into Wednesday, including the central region of Dnipropetrovsk, where 13 people were killed, according to the region´s governor, Valentyn Reznichenko. Reznichenko said the Russians fired at the city of Marganets and a nearby village. Dozens of residential buildings, two schools and several administrative buildings were damaged. ""It was a terrible night,"" Reznichenko said. ""It's very hard to take bodies from under debris. We are facing a cruel enemy who engages in daily terror against our cities and villages."" In Ukraine's east, where fighting has raged for eight years, a Russian attack on the center of the city of Bakhmut in the Donetsk region killed seven, wounded six and damaged stores, homes and apartment buildings, setting off fires, Ukraine's prosecutor general said on Telegram. Bakhmut is a key target for Russian forces as they advance on regional hubs. In the city of Donetsk, which has been under the control of Russia-backed separatists since 2014, Ukrainian shelling hit a brewery, killing one person and wounding two, the separatists´ emergency service said. It said the shelling late Wednesday caused a leak of toxic ammonia and warned people to stay inside and breathe through cotton gauze. Two residents of the village of Staryi Saltiv in the Kharkiv region in the northeast were killed Wednesday in Russian shelling, police reported. In the country's southeast, Moscow's forces continued shelling the city of Nikopol across the Dnieper River from the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia power station, the biggest nuclear plant in Europe. Ukraine and Russia have accused each other of shelling it, stoking international fears of a catastrophe. On Wednesday, foreign ministers of the Group of Seven industrialized democracies demanded that Russia immediately hand back full control of the plant to Ukraine. They said they are ""profoundly concerned"" about the risk of a nuclear accident with far-reaching consequences. The U.N. Security Council scheduled an open meeting Thursday at Russia's request on what it claims were Ukrainian attacks on the Zaporizhzhia plant. Rafael Grossi, the International Atomic Energy Agency chief who said last week that the situation at the plant ""is completely out of control,"" was expected to brief the council. ___ Associated Press writers Ellen Knickmeyer and Michael Biesecker in Washington and Jon Gambrell in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, contributed to this report. ___ Follow AP´s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine A satellite image by Planet Labs PBC shows Saki Air Base after an explosion there Wednesday, Aug. 10, 2022, in the Crimean Peninsula, the Black Sea peninsula seized from Ukraine by Russia and annexed in March 2014.

""Oil is already on Slovakia territory,"" Sulik said on Facebook. He gave no further details. But no oil has reached the neighboring Czech Republic yet, the country´s Mero pipeline operator said, and Hungary also was still to receive deliveries by Wednesday evening. Russian state pipeline operator Transneft said Tuesday it halted shipments through the southern branch of the Druzhba, or Friendship, pipeline, which runs through Ukraine to the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary. The northern leg of the Druzhba pipeline, which runs through Belarus to Poland and Germany, was unaffected, Transneft said. Transneft cited complications due to European Union sanctions for its action on Aug. 4, saying its payment to the company´s Ukrainian counterpart was refused. Earlier Wednesday, Sulik said the payments would be made by Slovak refiner Slovnaft after both the Russian and Ukrainian sides agreed to the solution. Slovnaft is owned by Hungary´s MOL energy group. A Hungarian motorist fills up his car in fear of running out of petrol in Budapest, Hungary, Wednesday, Aug. 10, 2022. Oil shipments from Russia through a critical pipeline to several European countries stopped a few days ago, but MOL, the Hungarian petrol company, has paid the transit fee to the Ukrainians instead of the Russians, so the delivery of oil to Hungary via the southern branch of the Friendship pipeline could resume within days according to MOL. (AP Photo/Anna Szilagyi) MOL confirmed the money has been transferred. But Slovnaft spokesman Anton Molnar said the deal covered only shipments to Slovakia and Hungary and not to the Czech Republic. Czech Industry and Trade Minister Jozef Sikela said his country has joined forces with Polish authorities to look for options to resume oil shipments to the Czech Republic. Two Czech oil refiners, including the one in Litvinov that processes Russian oil, are owned by Poland´s oil and energy giant PKN Orlen. Sikela didn´t provide more details. Slovakia receives practically all its oil through the Druzhba pipeline. Sulik said the payment is worth some 9-10 million euros (up to $10.2 million). He said his country would work on a long-term solution to the problem which he said was caused by the refusal of an unnamed bank in Western Europe to transfer the money due to the sanctions imposed by the EU on Russia for its war against Ukraine. ""I wouldn´t look for a political context behind it, there´s none,"" Sulik said. However, Simone Tagliapietra, an energy expert at the Bruegel think tank in Brussels, said Russia has weaponized natural gas heading to Europe by claiming technical issues, and ""this opens questions on whether it might now do the same with oil."" Russia has blamed equipment repairs for its decision to slash flows through the Nord Stream 1 pipeline to Germany, whose government has called it a political move to sow uncertainty and push up prices amid the war in Ukraine. EU leaders agreed in May to embargo most Russian oil imports by the end of the year as part of the bloc´s sanctions over Moscow´s invasion of Ukraine. The embargo covers Russian oil brought in by sea, but allowed temporary Druzhba pipeline shipments to Hungary and certain other landlocked countries in central Europe, such as Slovakia and the Czech Republic. ""These countries are very dependent on Russian oil and as such they might face shortages in the short term should the interruption be lasting,"" Tagliapietra said. Some drivers in Hungary were anticipating that on Wednesday, prompting MOL to appeal to the public asking customers to reduce their petrol purchases. ""For now, I keep trying to keep my car´s tank topped up, so I don´t run out of fuel. And then we´ll see,"" said Erzsebet Kovacs. ___ Courtney Bonnell in London and video journalist Bela Szandelszky in Budapest, Hungary, contributed. ___ Follow AP´s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine Hungarian motorist fills up her car while reading the banner which says ""we ask you to fill up to maximum 20 litres of 95 petrol at a time"" in Budapest, Hungary, Wednesday, Aug. 10, 2022.

Marina Ovsyannikova was charged over a separate street protest last month, when she held up a banner that said ""(Russian President Vladimir) Putin is a killer, his soldiers are fascists. 352 children have been killed (in Ukraine). How many more children should die for you to stop?"" If tried and convicted, Ovsyannikova faces up to 10 years in prison under a new law that penalizes statements against the military and that was enacted shortly after Russian troops moved into Ukraine, her lawyer, Dmitry Zakhvatov, said in a Telegram post. Ovsyannikova´s home was raided Wednesday and she was taken for questioning. Zakhvatov said the former producer for Russian state-funded Channel One would spend the night in a holding cell at Moscow police headquarters. Speaking to journalists outside the investigators' office, the lawyer said Ovsyannikova was holding up well. He said the new law, which allows people to be detained for picketing, showed that Russia's judicial system was in ""complete default."" Ovsyannikova made international headlines on March 14, when she appeared behind the anchor of an evening news broadcast holding a poster that said ""Stop the war, don´t believe the propaganda, they are lying to you here.""

She was fined two more times in recent weeks for disparaging the military in a critical Facebook post and in comments she made at the court where opposition figure Ilya Yashin was remanded into custody pending trial, also accused of spreading false information about the military. According to Net Freedoms, a legal aid group focusing on free speech cases, as of Wednesday there were 79 criminal cases on charges of spreading false information about the military and up to 4,000 administrative cases on charges of disparaging the armed forces. Independent journalists in Russia have come under particular Kremlin scrutiny. A Moscow court on Wednesday fined the independent Russian newspaper Novaya Gazeta 350,000 rubles ($5,700) for ""abusing the freedom of mass information."" It was unclear what the newspaper was accused of doing wrong. Since Putin came to power more than two decades ago, nearly two dozen journalists have been killed, including at least four who had worked for Novaya Gazeta. The newspaper shut down in March.

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-11098377/EXPLAINER-Fighting-Ukraine-endangers-big-nuclear-plant.html,2022-08-10,EXPLAINER: Fighting in Ukraine endangers big nuclear plant,"Russia and Ukraine have accused each other of shelling Europe's largest nuclear power plant, stoking international fears of a catastrophe on the continent. A look at the plant and the situation around it: EUROPE'S BIGGEST NUCLEAR PLANT The Zaporizhzhia plant is in southern Ukraine, near the town of Enerhodar on the banks of the Dnieper River. It is one of the 10 biggest nuclear plants in the world. Built during the Soviet era, it has six reactors with a total capacity of 5,700 megawatts. Three of the reactors are in operation. Before the war, the plant accounted for about half of the electricity generated by nuclear power in Ukraine. The country has 15 reactors at four active plants, and also is home to the decommissioned Chernobyl plant, the site of the 1986 nuclear disaster. RUSSIANS TAKE CONTROL FILE - In this handout photo taken from video and released by Russian Defense Ministry Press Service on Aug. 7, 2022, a general view of the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Station in territory under Russian military control, southeastern Ukraine. The Zaporizhzhia plant is in southern Ukraine, near the town of Enerhodar on the banks of the Dnieper River. It is one of the 10 biggest nuclear plants in the world. Russia and Ukraine have accused each other of shelling Europe's largest nuclear power plant, stoking international fears of a catastrophe on the continent. (Russian Defense Ministry Press Service via AP, File) Russian troops overran the plant shortly after invading Ukraine on Feb. 24. During the fighting in early March, Russian and Ukrainian forces exchanged fire near the plant. The skirmishes resulted in a fire at its training complex. The Russians have left the Ukrainian staff in place to keep the plant operating, and it has continued to supply electricity to government-controlled parts of Ukraine. The fighting around the plant has fueled fears of a disaster like the one at Chernobyl, where a reactor exploded and spewed deadly radiation, contaminating a vast area in the world's worst nuclear accident. Russian forces occupied the heavily contaminated Chernobyl site soon after the invasion but handed control back to the Ukrainians after withdrawing from the area at the end of March. RUSSIA AND UKRAINE TRADE ACCUSATIONS Ukraine has accused Russia of storing troops and weapons at the plant and using its grounds to launch strikes against Ukrainian-controlled territory across the Dnieper. Ukrainian officials and military analysts say Moscow's forces have cynically employed the plant as a shield, knowing that the Ukrainians would be hesitant to fire back. Russia has denied the accusations and, in turn, accused Ukrainian forces of repeatedly shelling the plant. A series of attacks on the plant over the past few days has damaged some of its auxiliary equipment but not its reactors, and there has been no threat of a radiation leak, according to Russian authorities. The Russian Defense Ministry said Ukrainian shelling of the plant on Sunday caused a power surge and smoke, triggering an emergency shutdown and forcing the staff to lower output from two of the reactors. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov warned that the Ukrainian shelling of the plant is ""fraught with catastrophic consequences for vast territories, for all of Europe,"" while the Russian Foreign Ministry has accused Ukraine of ""taking all of Europe hostage."" Ukrainian officials countered by accusing Russian forces of planting explosives at the plant in preparation for an expected Ukrainian counteroffensive in the region. They also have accused Russia of launching attacks from the plant using Ukrainian workers there as human shields and shelling the place themselves. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that the Russian shelling and mining of the plant amount to ""nuclear blackmail."" Zaporizhzhia Gov. Oleksandr Starukh said that while the reactors are well protected by their thick concrete containment domes, it is impossible to guarantee their safe operation because of the Russian troops' presence. He noted, too, that the storage sites at the plant for spent nuclear fuel are not as well protected as the reactors. Mark Wenman, a nuclear expert at London´s Imperial College, said the plant´s reactors are designed ""to protect against natural disasters and or man-made incidents such as aircraft crashes or reactor accidents."" ""I do not believe there would be a high probability of a breach of the containment building even if it was accidentally struck by an explosive shell, and even less likely the reactor itself could be damaged by such,"" he said. He added that the spent fuel is also stored in ""very robust steel and concrete containers that are designed to withstand very high-energy impacts."" CALLS FOR INTERNATIONAL MONITORING Rafael Mariano Grossi, director-general of the United Nations' nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, told The Associated Press last week that the situation surrounding the Zaporizhzhia plant ""is completely out of control,"" and he issued an urgent plea to Russia and Ukraine to allow experts to visit the complex to stabilize matters and avoid a nuclear accident. ""Every principle of nuclear safety has been violated"" at the plant, Grossi said. ""What is at stake is extremely serious and extremely grave and dangerous."" Grossi said the supply chain of equipment and spare parts has been interrupted, ""so we are not sure the plant is getting all it needs."" He noted that the IAEA also needs to perform highly important inspections to ensure that nuclear material is being safeguarded. Grossi added that there have been instances of friction and reports of violence between the Russians and the Ukrainian staff. ""When you put this together, you have a catalog of things that should never be happening in any nuclear facility,"" Grossi said. RUSSIA AND UKRAINE CLASH OVER IAEA VISIT The IAEA has sought in vain to send an inspection team to the plant for months. Moscow has said it welcomes a visit to the plant by the IAEA, but it is unclear whether it is ready to actually help arrange such a trip. Ukraine previously opposed Grossi's visit to the site for as long as it remains under Moscow's control, demanding the Russian military withdraw. This week, however, Ukrainian officials appeared to warm up to such a trip, with Ukraine´s ombudsman, Dmytro Lubinets, urging the U.N. and IAEA to send a delegation to help ""completely demilitarize the territory"" and provide security guarantees to plant employees. ____ Follow the AP´s coverage of the war at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine FILE - In this handout photo taken from video and released by Russian Defense Ministry Press Service on Aug. 7, 2022, A rocket fragment after shelling is seen near the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Station.

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-11097663/Japan-PM-new-Cabinet-shifting-church-ties.html,2022-08-10,Japan PM purges Cabinet after support falls over church ties,"Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida reshuffled his Cabinet on Wednesday in an apparent bid to distance his administration from the conservative Unification Church over its ties to the assassinated leader Shinzo Abe and senior ruling party members. The reshuffle, second in just 10 months since Kishida took office, followed his July election victory that had been expected to ensure long-term stability until 2025. But Abe´s shocking assassination on July 8 and its impact on politics increased uncertainty as public support for Kishida´s Cabinet plunged. Kishida said it was important to gain people's trust and that the new Cabinet included only those who agreed to strictly review their ties to the church and help the victims of the allegedly fraudulent religious businesses. ""We have to be careful about our relationship with an organization that has known social problems so that they won't raise suspicions among the public,"" Kishida said. A survey released Monday by the NHK public television showed support for Kishida´s Cabinet fell to 46% from 59%. Most of the respondents said they think politicians have not sufficiently explained their ties to the Unification Church. Kishida´s plan to hold a state funeral for Abe has also split public opinion because of Abe´s archconservative stance on national security and wartime history.

(Issei Kato/Pool Photo via AP) ""The Cabinet reshuffle was damage control"" to divert the public´s attention from the Unification Church scandal, political analyst Atsuo Ito told a TBS talk show. Abe was fatally shot while giving a campaign speech two days before the parliamentary election. Police and media reports say the suspect targeted Abe over suspected ties to the Unification Church, which the man hated because his mother´s massive financial donations to the church ruined his family. Abe, in his video message to the church affiliate the Universal Peace Foundation, in September 2021, praised its work toward peace on the Korean Peninsula and its focus on family values. Some experts say Abe's video appearance may have motived the suspect. The ties between the church and Japan´s governing party go back to Abe´s grandfather, Nobusuke Kishi, who served as prime minister and shared U.S. concerns over the spread of communism in Japan in the 1960s. The church since the 1980s has faced accusations of devious recruitment and brainwashing of its adherents into making huge donations. Critics say the church has contributed votes to lift borderline candidates to election victories, while allegedly pushing their opposition to equal rights for women and sexual minorities to be reflected on government policies. On Wednesday, Tomihiro Tanaka, president of the church, which now calls itself the Family Federation for World Peace and Unification, told a news conference that one of its church-related groups, which he called ""peace federation,"" is more politically active and involved in election campaigns. But he denied any ""political interference"" with specific parties and said that Kishida's call for his party members to distance themselves from the church was ""regrettable."" Tanaka said the church and its affiliate groups have naturally developed closer ties with the Liberal Democratic Party conservatives than others because of their shared anti-communist stance. ""We've worked together with politicians who have clear views against communism in order to build a better country,"" Tanaka said. ""We are pursuing the activity not only in Japan but as part of our global network against communism."" Kishida denied the church's ""inappropriate influence"" on government policies. Chief Cabinet Secretary Hirokazu Matsuno, who retained his post, announced the new Cabinet, including five ministers who kept their posts, another five who were brought back and nine first-timers. Seven ministers who acknowledged their ties to the church were removed. They include Defense Minister Nobuo Kishi, Abe's younger brother, who said that church followers were volunteers in his past election campaigns, and Public Safety Commission Chairman Satoshi Ninoyu, who attended an event organized by a church-related organization. Several newly appointed ministers said they had given donations and had others links to the church in the past, triggering criticism from opposition leaders. Japanese Communist Party senior lawmaker Akira Koike said the reshuffle failed to cover up the Unification Church ties. ""It only showed the LDP´s deep ties to the church because they cannot form a Cabinet if they exclude lawmakers linked to the church."" Kishida said the main purpose of the reshuffle was to ""break through one of biggest postwar crises"" such as the coronavirus pandemic, inflation, growing tensions between China and self-ruled Taiwan and Russia´s war on Ukraine. He said that bolstering Japan´s military capability and spending was a top priority. Kishi was replaced by former Defense Minister Yasukazu Hamada, and Taro Kono, who previously served as a vaccination tsar during the pandemic as well as foreign and defense minister, returned to the Cabinet as digital minister. Along with Matsuno, Foreign Minister Yoshimasa Hayashi, Economy Minister Daishiro Yamagiwa, Transportation Minister Tetsuo Saito, Finance Minister Shunichi Suzuki also kept their jobs. Economy and Trade Minister Koici Hagiuda, who also had church ties, was shifted to head the party policy research committee and replaced by former Economy Minister Yasutoshi Nishimura. Katsunobu Kato was appointed health minister for the third time, tasked with coronavirus measures. The new Cabinet suggested Kishida tasked veterans with key portfolios such as diplomacy, defense, economic security and pandemic measures while carefully keeping a power balance among party wings to solidify unity amid growing speculation of a power struggle within Abe's faction. Despite criticism that Japanese politics is dominated by older men, the majority of the Cabinet members are still men older than 60, with only two women. They include Sanae Takaichi, an ultra-conservative close to Abe who was appointed economic security minister, and Keiko Nagaoka, a first-timer who became education minister and replaced Shinsuke Suematsu, who also acknowledged his Unification Church links. Gender Minister Seiko Noda, who admitted to sending a message to a church-related group´s event in 2001 that was attended by her aide, was replaced by Masanobu Ogura in his first Cabinet post.

""In seeking to join NATO, Finland and Sweden are making a sacred commitment that an attack against one is an attack against all,"" Biden said at the signing as he called the partnership the ""indispensable alliance."" The U.S. became the 23rd ally to approve NATO membership for the two countries. Biden said he spoke with the heads of both nations before signing the ratification and urged the remaining NATO members to finish their own ratification process ""as quickly as possible."" The Senate last week approved the two, once-non-aligned nations joining the alliance in a rare 95-1 vote that Biden said shows the world that ""the United States of America can still do big things"" with a sense of political unity. The countries sought out NATO membership earlier this year to guarantee their security in the wake of Russian President Vladimir Putin's offensive in Ukraine. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization's rules require the consent of all of its 30 existing members before Finland and Sweden can officially accede into the alliance, which is expected in the coming months. The candidacies of the two prosperous Northern European nations have won ratification from more than half of the NATO member nations in the roughly three months since the two applied. It marks one of the speediest expansions of the pact of mutual defense among the United States and democratic allies in Europe in its 73-year history.

Finland is expected to exceed NATO´s 2% gross domestic product defense spending target in 2022, and Sweden has committed to meet the 2% goal. Sweden and Finland applied to join NATO in May, setting aside their longstanding stance of military nonalignment. It was a major shift of security arrangements for the two countries after neighboring Russia launched its war on Ukraine in late February. Biden encouraged their joining and welcomed the two countries´ government heads to the White House in May, standing side by side with them in a display of U.S. backing. The U.S. and its European allies have rallied with newfound partnership in the face of Putin´s military invasion, as well as the Russian leader´s sweeping statements this year condemning NATO, issuing veiled reminders of Russia´s nuclear arsenal and asserting Russia´s historical claims to territory of many of its neighbors.

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-11096165/Russian-diplomat-chides-US-rushing-nuclear-inspections.html,2022-08-09,Russian diplomat chides US for rushing nuclear inspections,"A senior Russian diplomat said Tuesday that Moscow's decision to declare a freeze on U.S. inspections of its nuclear arsenals under a key arms control treaty was triggered by Washington's push for a quick visit by inspectors. Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said the U.S. demand for Russia to immediately allow an inspection trip under the New START treaty looked like an ""open provocation"" amid the current U.S.-Russian tensions. ""A notice about the U.S. intention to perform an inspection on our territory in the nearest days became a trigger,"" Ryabkov said in a statement posted on the Russian Foreign Ministry's website. The ministry responded Monday by announcing a temporary halt on U.S. inspections. It argued that the sanctions on Russian flights imposed by the U.S. and its allies, visa restrictions and other obstacles effectively have made it impossible for Russian military experts to visit U.S. nuclear weapons sites, giving the U.S. ""unilateral advantages."" The Biden administration had no immediate public response to the move, which came amid soaring tensions between Moscow and Washington over Russia´s military action in Ukraine. While Russia and the U.S. have suspended mutual inspections under the New START since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, Moscow's move raised new uncertainty about the pact's future. A spokesperson for the U.S. National Security Council noted a pause in inspections due to the pandemic, adding that the responsible thing to do is to resume them safely. The spokesperson emphasized that resuming mutually beneficial inspections under New START is a key part of Russia-U.S. cooperation that must continue even when geopolitical tensions are high. The Russian Foreign Ministry noted that the freeze is temporary, adding in Monday´s statement that Moscow ""highly values"" the New START and saying inspections could resume after the problems hampering them are solved. The New START treaty, signed in 2010 by President Barack Obama and Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, limits each country to no more than 1,550 deployed nuclear warheads and 700 deployed missiles and bombers, and envisages sweeping on-site inspections to verify compliance. Just days before the New START was due to expire in February 2021, Russia and the United States agreed to extend it for another five years. Ryabkov said that Russia has been open to discussions about the resumption of inspections, but emphasized that it should be done on the basis of parity and equality. He charged that instead of negotiating mutually acceptable arrangements for inspectors' trips, ""Washington decided otherwise and engaged in an unfounded and unnecessary exacerbation of the situation."" ""We are calling on the U.S. to renounce counterproductive actions ... and continue close cooperation for the sake of the soonest resumption of inspections on a realistic and equal basis,"" he said. ___ Zeke Miller in Washington contributed to this report."

Russia adopted a law criminalizing spreading ""false information"" about its military shortly after Russian troops rolled into Ukraine on Feb. 24. The law, which stipulates a prison sentence of up to 15 years, has been used against dozens of people to stifle opposition to the war. The Basmanny court ordered Kara Murza, 40, held until Oct. 12, Russian news agencies reported. Kara Murza, a journalist, was an associate of opposition leader Boris Nemtsov, who was killed near the Kremlin in 2015. He himself survived poisonings in 2015 and 2017 that he blamed on the Kremlin. Russian officials have denied responsibility. The criminal case against him stems from a March 15 speech he gave to the Arizona House of Representatives in which he denounced Russia´s invasion of Ukraine. The law was adopted a week after the invasion, which was met by a wave of public outrage and protests on the streets of Moscow and St. Petersburg. The Kremlin insisted its ""special military operation"" in Ukraine had overwhelming public support and moved swiftly to suppress any criticism. Thousands of protesters were arrested, dozens of critical media outlets were shut down and critics have faced prosecution."

In cases like this, Richardson said in an interview with The Associated Press, ""it´s proportional - two-for two."" Richardson, who traveled to Russia in advance of the release by Moscow of Marine veteran Trevor Reed in an April prisoner swap, declined to discuss the current status of negotiations with Russia over Griner or Whelan or to explain what role he may be playing in the talks. But he said he felt ""relatively positive"" for several reasons. For one, the conclusion of the criminal case against Griner last week - she was convicted and sentenced to nine years in prison on drug charges - provides an opening for diplomatic negotiations to begin in earnest. Plus, he said, the U.S. and Russia have already shown a willingness to carry out prisoner swaps, as evidenced by the Reed exchange. And Griner's strategy of expressing contrition before a Russian court was important. ""And that is why I think a two-for-two deal is hopefully a likely outcome,"" Richardson said. Secretary of State Antony Blinken took the unusual step of revealing publicly last month that the U.S. in June made a ""substantial proposal"" to get Griner and Whelan home. He did not elaborate, but the AP and other news organizations have reported that the U.S. has offered to free Viktor Bout, a Russian arms dealer who is serving a 25-year sentence in the U.S. and once earned the nickname the ""Merchant of Death.""

(AP Photo/Alexander Zemlianichenko) Russia made a counteroffer that the U.S. did not regard as serious, the White House has said. It is not clear which other Russian could be included in a two-for-two deal, assuming it happens. Griner, the most prominent American jailed by a foreign government, has acknowledged there were vape canisters containing cannabis oil in her luggage when she was arrested at a Moscow airport in February. But she insisted that she had no criminal intent and that the canisters ended up in her luggage because she was packing hastily. Griner played for a Russian women´s basketball team in the WNBA off-season. Whelan, a corporate security executive from Michigan, was sentenced in 2020 to 16 years in prison on espionage-related charges he and his family say are manufactured. The U.S. government regards both him and Griner as wrongful detainees. Though Richardson said he was cautiously optimistic, and even though there is recent precedent for prisoner swaps, such deals aren't easy. ""The relationship between the United States and Russia is quite toxic,"" he said.

Occidental's stock rose more than 3.5% on Tuesday to $62.18 after Buffett revealed his latest purchases of nearly 6.7 million Occidental shares worth more than $400 million. Wall Street follows Buffett's actions closely, including his investments in Occidental Petroleum. Its shares have more than doubled in price this year. Berkshire has repeatedly acquired shares of the Houston driller whenever the stock falls below $60 in recent months. Buffett also dropped more than $20 billion on Chevron stock in the first quarter of this year and took advantage of the surge in oil prices after Russia invaded Ukraine. Berkshire's Chevron stake is worth more than $24 billion. That means Buffett's Omaha, Nebraska, conglomerate holds nearly $47 billion in oil sector investments because Berkshire holds another $10 billion worth of preferred Occidental shares that it picked up in 2019 when it helped finance Occidental's purchase of Anadarko. And Buffett may not be done. Berkshire owns warrants to buy another 83.9 million Occidental shares at $59.62 apiece.

That could provide a roughly $2 billion a year boost to Berkshire's bottom line. Buffett aggressively invested in stocks this year when the market was weighed down by soaring inflation and rising interest rates. Berkshire spent more than $51 billion on stocks in the first quarter, but the pace of its investments slowed considerably in the second quarter when it was a net buyer of only $3.8 billion in stocks with much of that going into Occidental. Berkshire will detail all its second-quarter stock purchases later this month. In addition to the stakes it holds in companies, Berkshire owns more than 90 companies outright, including BNSF railroad, Geico insurance, several major utilities and an eclectic assortment of manufacturing and retail businesses like See's Candy, Dairy Queen, Helzberg Diamonds, Fruit of the Loom and Precision Castparts.

South Korea, a longtime U.S. ally, is struggling to strike a balance between Washington and the increasingly assertive foreign policy of Chinese President Xi Jinping´s government. U.S.-Chinese conflict over Taiwan has added to complications for governments that want amicable ties with both sides. Foreign Ministers Park Jin and Wang Yi, in separate statements from their meeting in the eastern Chinese city of Qingdao, called for the development of relations based on three decades of successful commercial ties. Park´s ministry said the countries agreed to increase high-level communication over supply chain issues, climate change cooperation and facilitating cultural exchanges. It said the countries agreed to pursue ""two-plus-two"" talks by vice ministerial-level officials of foreign affairs and defense within this year. Park and Wang gave no indication they discussed tensions over last week´s visit by U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to self-ruled Taiwan, which the mainland´s ruling Communist Party claims is Chinese territory. Beijing reacted to her visit by conducting military drills to intimidate the island and called off dialogue with Washington on climate change and other issues. Pelosi visited South Korea last week, but South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol, who was on vacation, talked to her by phone instead of face to face. His critics accused him of avoiding seeing her to protect relations with China. In this photo provided by South Korea Foreign Ministry, South Korean Foreign Minister Park Jin, left, bumps elbows with his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi prior to their meeting in Qingdao, China, Tuesday, Aug. 9, 2022. (South Korea Foreign Ministry via AP) Yoon, who took office in May, wants to strengthen security cooperation with Washington and Japan in response to North Korean nuclear threats. China, North Korea´s main ally, sees Japan as a strategic rival but also is South Korea´s biggest export market. South Korea´s pursuit of closer ties with Washington could possibly complicate relations with China. South Korea is weighing whether to participate in a U.S.-led semiconductor alliance involving Taiwan and Japan, which China sees as an economic threat. Yoon's stated desire to install more U.S. anti-missile systems to cope with growing North Korean threats is also concerning for China, which insists such systems could be reconfigured to peep into its territory. China´s state-run Xinhua news agency said Wang and Park had an ""in-depth exchange of views"" over South Korea´s deployment of the U.S. Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense system, or THAAD, and both expressed hope that the issue wouldn´t become a ""stumbling block"" in relations. Bilateral ties took a significant hit when South Korea installed its first THAAD battery in 2017 as Beijing retaliated by suspending Chinese group tours to South Korea and obliterating the China business of South Korean supermarket giant Lotte, which had provided land for the missile system. Yoon during his presidential campaign has called for additional deployment of THAAD to better protect capital Seoul from North Korean missile threats. Park and Wang called for maintaining stable industry supply chains, a possible reference to fears that Chinese technology policy and U.S. security controls might split the world into separate markets with incompatible standards and products, slowing innovation and raising costs. Park expressed hope the two sides will increase cooperation based on ""universal values and standards."" He said they should overcome new challenges posed by a ""great transition in international society"" but gave no details. Park appealed to Beijing to help persuade North Korea to return to talks on its nuclear weapons program, which he called an ""unprecedented threat"" to peace on the Korean Peninsula. Park stressed that the U.N.-led international community should respond to major North Korean provocations with stern and unified measures and urged closer consultation between Seoul and Beijing over the North´s accelerating efforts to expand its arsenal, according to his ministry. China and Russia recently vetoed U.S.-sponsored resolutions at the U.N. Security Council that would have increased sanctions on the North over some of its ballistic missile testing this year, underscoring division between the council´s permanent members that deepened over Russia´s war on Ukraine. Wang´s statement didn´t mention the nuclear issue and gave no indication whether he said what Beijing might do. The South Korean Foreign Ministry said Wang told Park that China will continue to make possible efforts for peace in the Korean Peninsula. Park also expressed hope that Xi, the Chinese leader, would visit South Korea.

Russian state pipeline operator Transneft said it halted shipments through the southern branch of the Druzhba oil pipeline, which flows through Ukraine to the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary. Transneft cited complications due to European Union sanctions for its action on Aug. 4, saying its payment to the company's Ukrainian counterpart was refused. The northern leg of the Druzhba pipeline, which runs through Belarus to Poland and Germany, was unaffected, Transneft reported. EU leaders agreed in May to embargo most Russian oil imports by the end of the year as part of the bloc's sanctions over Moscow's war in Ukraine. The embargo covers Russian oil brought in by sea but allowed temporary Druzhba pipeline shipments to Hungary and certain other landlocked countries in central Europe.

Russian state pipeline operator Transneft said it halted shipments through the southern branch of the Druzhba oil pipeline, which flows through Ukraine to the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary. (AP Photo/Bela Szandelszky, File) Slovakia´s oil pipeline network operator, Transpetrol, and the refining company Slovnaft confirmed that Druzhba shipments to the nation had stopped. Slovakia receives almost all its oil through the Druzhba pipeline. Slovnaft, which is owned by Hungary´s MOL energy group, said its production has not been affected. Slovnaft spokesperson Anton Molnar said the company and MOL were discussing with Russia and Ukraine an option for MOL, or Slovnaft, to pay the transit fees. ""The following days will show if it´s another escalation of the energy war by Russia or a technical problem about payments,"" Czech Industry and Trade Minister Jozef Sikela said. Slovakia´s economy minister, Richard Sulik, previously said his country has enough oil in its reserves for about 120 days. Russia has also curtailed natural gas shipments to Europe after most countries refused to abide by Russian President Vladimir Putin's wartime order requiring payments in rubles instead of dollars or euros. ___ Follow AP's coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine"

Michael Czerny is one of cardinals most closely associated with Pope Francis´ pontificate. A Jesuit who ministered in El Salvador, Czerny heads the Vatican office responsible for Francis' priority portfolios of migration, the environment, development and social justice. A Czech-born Canadian, Czerny recently joined Francis on his landmark visit to Canada to apologize to Indigenous peoples for the Catholic Church´s role in running the country´s notorious residential schools. On Tuesday, Czerny commemorated the anniversary of the day Stein was killed in Auschwitz´s gas chambers by celebrating Mass in a nearby Carmelite convent in Oswiecim, a Polish town under Nazi German occupation during the war. There, he delivered a homily that recounted Stein´s story and how it intersected with his own and that of his relatives, who hailed from Brno, in the former Czechoslovakia. Stein was a German Jew born in 1891 in Breslau, now the Polish city of Wroclaw, who converted to Catholicism in 1922 and became a nun. She joined the Carmelite order in Cologne, Germany, but was transferred to the Netherlands after the intensification of Nazi attacks in 1938. She was arrested in 1942 after Hitler ordered the arrest of Jewish converts and was sent to Auschwitz, where she was killed Aug. 9, 1942. St. John Paul II canonized Stein as a martyr in 1998 and made her a patron saint of Europe the following year. Czerny, 76, noted that he and Stein shared their ""Jewish origins, the Catholic faith, a vocation to religious life,"" as well as the fact that Stein and Czerny´s maternal grandmother, Anna Hayek, were about the same age and ""came to a similar end."" ""My mother´s family - both parents and two brothers - were also Catholic but shared the Jewish origins that the enemy abhorred,"" Czerny recalled in the text of his homily, which his office provided. ""My maternal grandmother Anna, my grandfather Hans and my uncles Georg and Carl Robert, were all interned in Terezín, where Hans died,"" Czerny said, referring to the Theresienstadt concentration camp in the former Czechoslovakia.

(AP Photo/Andrew Medichini, File) ""My grandmother and uncles were transported to Auschwitz. From here my uncles were sent to labor camps and eventually murdered there,"" he said. His grandmother died of typhus in 1945, but the family has no trace of where she was buried. Czerny´s mother, a baptized Catholic, was forced to work as a farm laborer during the war because of her Jewish ancestry and was jailed in Theresienstadt and Leipzig for 20 months; his father was forced to work as a farm laborer because he refused to divorce her. In 1948, they moved to Canada as refugees with young Michael, who was born in 1946, and his brother, the cardinal said. Czerny, who has made humanitarian visits to minister to refugees fleeing Ukraine on behalf of Francis, said he was honored to celebrate Stein in the year of Russia´s war that he said ""urges us to remember."" ""Remembering both Edith and Anna with the six million others, we mourn and repent, `Lest we forget ...,´"" he said.

At least one person was killed and several others were wounded, authorities said. Russia´s Defense Ministry denied the Saki base on the Black Sea had been shelled and said instead that munitions had blown up there. But Ukrainian social networks were abuzz with speculation that it was hit by Ukrainian-fired long-range missiles. Videos posted on social networks showed sunbathers on nearby beaches fleeing as huge flames and pillars of smoke rose over the horizon from multiple points, accompanied by loud booms. Crimea Today News said on Telegram that witnesses reported fire on a runway and damage to nearby homes as a result of what it said were dozens of blasts. Russia´s state news agency Tass quoted an unidentified ministry source as saying the explosions´ primary cause appeared to be a ""violation of fire safety requirements."" The ministry said no warplanes were damaged. Ukraine´s Defense Ministry said sarcastically on Facebook: ""The Ministry of Defense of Ukraine cannot establish the cause of the fire, but once again recalls the rules of fire safety and the prohibition of smoking in unspecified places."" A presidential adviser, Oleksiy Arestovych, said cryptically in his regular online interview that the blasts were caused either by a Ukrainian-made long-range weapon or were the work of partisans operating in Crimea. Rising smoke can be seen from the beach at Saky after explosions were heard from the direction of a Russian military airbase near Novofedorivka, Crimea, Tuesday Aug. 9, 2022. The explosion of munitions caused a fire at a military air base in Russian-annexed Crimea Tuesday but no casualties or damage to stationed warplanes, Russia's Defense Ministry said. (UGC via AP) During the war, Russia has reported numerous fires and explosions at munitions storage sites on its territory near the Ukrainian border, blaming some of them on Ukrainian strikes. Ukrainian authorities have mostly remained mum about the incidents. If Ukrainian forces were, in fact, responsible for the blasts at the air base, it would be the first known major attack on a Russian military site on the Crimean Peninsula, which the Kremlin annexed in 2014. A smaller explosion last month at the headquarters of Russia´s Black Sea Fleet in the Crimean port of Sevastopol was blamed on Ukrainian saboteurs using a makeshift drone. Russian warplanes have used the Saki base to strike areas in Ukraine´s south on short notice. One person was killed, said Crimea´s regional leader, Sergei Aksyonov. Crimean health authorities said nine people were wounded, one of whom remained hospitalized. Others were treated for cuts from shards of glass and released. Officials in Moscow have long warned Ukraine that any attack on Crimea would trigger massive retaliation, including strikes on ""decision-making centers"" in Kyiv. For his part, Ukraine's president vowed to retake Crimea from Russia. ""This Russian war against Ukraine and against all of free Europe began with Crimea and must end with Crimea - its liberation,"" President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Tuesday in his nightly video address. ""Today it is impossible to say when this will happen. But we are constantly adding the necessary components to the formula for the liberation of Crimea."" Earlier Tuesday, Ukrainian officials reported at least three Ukrainian civilians were killed and 23 wounded by Russian shelling in 24 hours, including an attack not far from the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. The Russians fired over 120 rockets at the town of Nikopol, across the Dnieper River from the plant, Dnipropetrovsk Gov. Valentyn Reznichenko said. Several apartment buildings and industrial sites were damaged, he said. Ukraine and Russia have accused each other of shelling the power station, Europe´s biggest nuclear plant, stoking international fears of a catastrophe. The governor of the region where the plant is situated, Oleksandr Starukh, said Tuesday that radiation levels were normal. But he warned that an accident could spread radiation whichever way the wind blows, carrying it to Moscow and other Russian cities. A Russian-installed official in the partially occupied Zaporizhzhia region said an air defense system at the plant would be reinforced in the aftermath of last week´s shelling. Evgeny Balitsky, head of the Kremlin-backed administration, told Russian state TV that power lines and other damaged portions of the plant were restored. The Ukrainians in recent weeks have been mounting counterattacks in Russian-occupied areas of southern Ukraine while trying to hold off the Kremlin´s forces in the industrial Donbas region in the east. Also Tuesday, a U.S. official said Iran has agreed to supply Russia with drones for use in the war in Ukraine. The official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive information, said ""during the last several weeks, Russian officials conducted training in Iran as part of the agreement for UAV transfers from Iran to Russia."" The White House released satellite images in mid-July indicating that Russians had visited an Iranian airbase to see weapons-capable drones. But U.S. officials said later that month that they had seen no evidence yet of Iran supplying Russia with the drones. Ukrainian officials this month said Iran has transferred drones to Russia and some have been used in combat. ___ Associated Press writer Chris Megerian in Washington contributed to this report. ___ Follow AP´s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine Vera Vasiukova, 71, left, sits on her bed at a center for displaced people near Mykolaiv, Ukraine, Tuesday, Aug. 9, 2022.

Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas wrote Tuesday on Twitter that ""visiting Europe is a privilege, not a human right"" and that it is ""time to end tourism from Russia now."" A day earlier, her counterpart in Finland, Sanna Marin, told Finnish broadcaster YLE that ""it is not right that while Russia is waging an aggressive, brutal war of aggression in Europe, Russians can live a normal life, travel in Europe, be tourists."" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy went further in a Washington Post interview Monday, saying all Western countries should ban Russian tourists. Estonia and Finland both border Russia and are members of the European Union, which banned air travel from Russia after it invaded Ukraine. But Russians can still travel by land to both countries and apparently are then taking flights to other European destinations. The calls for a travel ban have sparked outrage within Russia, from both the Kremlin and its critics. Opposition-minded public figures condemned the comments in social media posts as fueling Moscow´s anti-Western propaganda and being unhelpful in stopping the war.

(AP Photo/Geert Vanden Wijngaert, Pool) ""I think that over time, common sense will somehow manifest itself, and those who made such statements will come to their senses,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Tuesday. YLE reported last week that Russian companies have started offering car trips from St. Petersburg to the airports of Helsinki and Lappeenranta in Finland, which have direct connections to several places in Europe. Russia´s second-largest city is about 300 kilometers (186 miles) from the Finnish capital. Visas issued by Finland are valid across most of Europe's travel zone, known as the ""Schengen area"" which is made up of 26 countries: 22 EU nations plus Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland. Normally, people and goods move freely between these countries without border checks. Nineteen other countries outside this travel area allow in foreigners using a Schengen visa. Finland just resumed accepting applications for tourist visas in Russia on July 1, lifting monthslong travel restrictions imposed during the COVID-19 pandemic. Some EU countries no longer issue visas to Russians, including Latvia, which made that decision this month because of the war. The visa issue is expected be discussed at an informal meeting of EU foreign ministers on Aug. 31, YLE reported. ""I would believe that in future European Council meetings, this issue will come up even more strongly. My personal position is that tourism should be restricted,"" Marin told the Finnish broadcaster. Peskov on Tuesday said calls for travel bans are usually coming from countries that Moscow has already deemed ""hostile"" and ""many of those countries in their hostility sink into oblivion."" Putin´s close associate and deputy head of Russia´s Security Council, Dmitry Medvedev, dismissed the Estonian premier's statement, adding ominously: ""I just want to remind her of another saying: `The fact that you are free is not your merit, but our flaw.'"" Zelenskyy told The Washington Post that ""the most important sanctions are to close the borders"" for Russian travelers, ""because the Russians are taking away someone else´s land."" Russians should ""live in their own world until they change their philosophy,"" Zelenskyy said, adding that such restrictions should apply to all Russians, even those who left the country and oppose the war. It's contrasts with what he said in March, a month after Moscow sent troops into Ukraine, when he urged Russians to leave the country to avoid funding the war with their taxes. Asked about Zelenskyy´s remarks, Peskov, the Kremlin spokesman, called them a ""statement ... that speaks for itself,"" which Moscow views ""extremely negatively."" ___ Follow AP´s coverage of the war at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine. ___ This story has been corrected to show that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy´s interview with The Washington Post was on Monday, not Tuesday.

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-11094463/Ukrainian-resistance-grows-Russian-occupied-areas.html,2022-08-09,Ukrainian resistance grows in Russian-occupied areas,"In a growing challenge to Russia's grip on occupied areas of southeastern Ukraine, guerrilla forces loyal to Kyiv are killing pro-Moscow officials, blowing up bridges and trains, and helping the Ukrainian military by identifying key targets. The spreading resistance has eroded Kremlin control of those areas and threatened its plans to hold referendums in various cities as a move toward annexation by Russia. ""Our goal is to make life unbearable for the Russian occupiers and use any means to derail their plans,"" said Andriy, a 32-year-old coordinator of the guerrilla movement in the southern Kherson region. A member of the Zhovta Strichka - or ""Yellow Ribbon"" - resistance group, Andriy spoke to The Associated Press on condition of not being fully identified to avoid being tracked down by the Russians. The group takes its name from one of the two national colors of Ukraine, and its members use ribbons of that hue to mark potential targets for guerrilla attacks. Ukrainian troops recently used a U.S.-supplied multiple rocket launcher known as HIMARS to hit a strategic bridge on the Dnieper River in Kherson, severing the Russians' main supply link. The city of 500,000 people, seized by Russian troops early in the war, has been flooded with leaflets from the resistance, threatening Moscow-backed officials. Just before the bridge attack, leaflets appeared, saying, ""If HIMARS can´t do it, a partisan will help.""

Russia and Ukraine have trade blame over shelling of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Europe's largest.This photo was taken during a trip organized by the Russian Ministry of Defense. (AP Photo, File) ""We are giving the Ukrainian military precise coordinates for various targets, and the guerrillas' assistance makes the new long-range weapons, particularly HIMARS, even more powerful,"" Andriy told the AP. ""We are invisible behind the Russian lines, and this is our strength."" As Ukrainian forces step up attacks in the region and reclaim some areas west of the Dnieper River, the guerrilla activity also has increased. They coordinate with the Ukrainian military's Special Operations Forces, which helps them develop strategies and tactics. Those forces also select targets and set up a website with tips on how to organize resistance, prepare ambushes and elude arrest. A network of weapons caches and secret hideouts was established in occupied areas. Bombs have been placed near administrative buildings, at officials' homes and even on their routes to work. An explosive placed on a tree went off as a vehicle carrying Kherson prison chief Yevgeny Sobolev passed by, although he survived the attack. A police vehicle was hit by a shrapnel bomb, seriously wounding two officers, one of whom later died. The deputy head of the local administration in Nova Kakhovka died of wounds after being gunned down over the weekend. Guerrillas have repeatedly tried to kill Vladimir Saldo, the head of the Kherson region's Russia-backed temporary administration, offering a bounty of 1 million hryvnias (about $25,000). His assistant, Pavel Slobodchikov, was shot and killed in his vehicle, and another official, Dmytry Savluchenko, was killed by a car bomb. The attacks have prompted Moscow to send anti-guerrilla units to Kherson, Saldo said. ""Every day, special units from Russia detect two or three caches with weapons for terrorist activities,"" Saldo said on his messaging app channel. ""The seizure of weapons help reduce the threat of sabotage."" Early in the occupation, thousands of residents staged peaceful protests. But the Russian military quickly disbanded them and arrested activists, radicalizing the resistance. Wedding photographer-turned-activist Oleksandr Kharchikov, 41, of Skadovsk, said he was beaten and tortured after being arrested in a Russian security sweep. ""The Russians tortured me for a long time. They beat me with a baseball bat, they pinched my fingers with pliers and tortured me with electric shocks,"" Kharchikov said in a telephone interview. ""I suffered a concussion and a broken rib, but I didn't give them any information, and that saved me."" Kharchikov spent 155 days under Russian occupation until he escaped. ""The repressions are intensifying. They are creating unbearable conditions for the Ukrainians, making it increasingly difficult to survive under Russian occupation,"" he told the AP. The Russians were offering 10,000 rubles ($165) to anyone applying for Russian citizenship to strengthen their grip on the region, he said. Moscow has introduced the ruble, set up Russian cellular networks and cut off Ukrainian television in the area. Giant screens showing Russian TV broadcasts have been placed on the main squares of cities. Melitopol Mayor Ivan Fedorov, who also spent a long time in Russian captivity, told the AP that about 500 Ukrainian activists were detained, with many tortured. Some vanished for months after their arrest. In May and June, guerrillas blew up two railway bridges in Melitopol and derailed two Russian military trains, Fedorov said. ""The resistance movement is pursuing three goals -- to destroy Russian weapons and means of supplying them, discrediting and intimidating the occupiers and their collaborators, and informing Ukrainian special services about enemy positions,"" he added. Russia responded by bolstering patrols and conducting regular sweeps for those suspected of guerrilla links. During such raids, they check phones and arrest those with Ukrainian symbols or photos of relatives in military uniforms. ""In a mopping-up operation, the Russians seal the entire neighborhood, halt traffic to and from it, and methodically go from one apartment to another. If they find any Ukrainian symbols or any link to the Ukrainian military, they put all family members in a filtration camp,"" Fedorov said. ""In the best case, people are told: `Get out of here if you are against Russia,´ but it also happens that some people disappear,"" he said. Of Melitopol´s prewar population of 150,000, more than 60,000 people have left. Pro-Moscow officials are preparing for a possible referendum on Melitopol and other occupied areas joining Russia, conducting security raids and handing out Russian passports, Fedorov said. ""We will thwart the Russian referendum. We won't allow voting under Russian gun barrels,"" he said, adding that no more than 10% of the population sympathizes with Moscow, and half has fled. Guerrillas have tied yellow ribbons on buildings where voting is to be held, warning residents that they could be targeted by bombs during balloting. The resistance ranges from radical activists to teachers and retirees who sing Ukrainian songs in parks and secretly wear yellow and blue ribbons. ""The Russians were expecting that they would be met with flowers, but they faced the fact that most people consider themselves Ukrainians and are ready to offer resistance in various forms - from collecting information to burning and blowing up the occupiers,"" said Oleksii Aleksandrov, who owned a restaurant in the southern port of Mariupol. In one recent gesture of defiance in Mariupol, a young man wrapped in a Ukrainian flag stood on a street next to the theater destroyed by Russian bombs. The photo spread through Ukrainian media, and President Volodymyr Zelenskyy hailed him in an address to the nation. ""It was a very brave thing to do, and I would like to thank him for his action,"" Zelenskyy said. ""This man is one of many people who are waiting for Ukraine's comeback and won't accept the occupation under any circumstances."" Although pro-Moscow sentiment is strong in Ukraine's mostly Russian-speaking industrial heartland of the Donbas, a guerrilla movement also has emerged there. Luhansk Gov. Serhiy Haidai said six Russian troops were wounded last month when their vehicle was blown up by guerrillas in the city of Sievierodonetsk soon after its seizure. They also have targeted railways, disrupting Russian munitions shipments and other supplies. ""The guerrillas have acted quite successfully,"" Haidai told the AP. ""They haven't only spread leaflets. They also have destroyed infrastructure facilities. It helps a lot to slow down the Russian attacks and advances."" Observers say the guerrilla movement varies by region and that it is in the interest of both sides to exaggerate its scope. ""The Russians do it to justify their repressions on the occupied territories while the Ukrainians seek to demoralize the Russian forces and extol their victories,"" said Vadim Karasev, head of the Kyiv-based Institute of Global Strategies think tank.

The Soyuz rocket lifted off as scheduled at 8:52 a.m. Moscow time (0552 GMT) Tuesday from the Russia-leased Baikonur launch facility in Kazakhstan. About nine minutes after the launch, it placed the Iranian satellite called Khayyam into orbit. It's named after Omar Khayyam, a Persian scientist who lived in the 11th and 12th centuries. Iran has said the satellite fitted with high-resolution camera will be used for environmental monitoring and will remain fully under its control. Tehran said no other country will have access to information it gathers and it would be used for civilian purposes only, but there have been allegations that Russia may use it for surveillance of Ukraine amid its military action there. If it operates successfully, the satellite would give Iran the ability to monitor its archenemy Israel and other countries in the Middle East.

Tehran said the satellite will help improve productivity in the agriculture sector, survey water resources, manage natural disasters, confront deforestation and monitor border areas. Citing Iran´s civilian space agency, state television said the satellite would provide high-resolution surveillance images with a one-meter-per-pixel definition. Western civilian satellites offer around half-a-meter per pixel, while U.S. spy satellites are believed to have even-greater definition. Iran has both a civilian and military space program, which the U.S. fears could be used to advance its ballistic missile program.

Mayor Tomihisa Taue, in his speech Tuesday at the Nagasaki Peace Park, said nuclear weapons can be used as long as they exist, and their elimination is the only way to save the future of humankind. Russia's invasion of Ukraine and threat of nuclear weapons use came only a month after it and four other nuclear powers pledged in a statement that nuclear war should never be fought, Taue noted. ""This has shown the world that the use of nuclear weapons is not a groundless fear but a tangible and present crisis,"" he said. The belief that nuclear weapons can be possessed not for actual use but for deterrence ""is a fantasy, nothing more than a mere hope."" As in Hiroshima, Russia and its ally Belarus were not invited to the memorial event in Nagasaki. The United States dropped the world´s first atomic bomb on Hiroshima on Aug. 6, 1945, destroying the city and killing 140,000 people. It dropped a second bomb three days later on Nagasaki, killing another 70,000. Japan surrendered on Aug. 15, ending World War II and Japan´s nearly half-century of aggression in Asia. Doves fly over the Peace Statue during a ceremony to mark the 77th anniversary of the U.S. atomic bombing at the Peace Park in Nagasaki, southern Japan, Tuesday, Aug. 9, 2022. (Kyodo News via AP) Participants, including diplomats from nuclear states, observed a moment of silence at 11:02 a.m., the moment the bomb exploded above the southern Japanese city on Aug. 9, 1945. Although Russia last week tried to roll back on Putin´s warning, fears of a third atomic bombing have grown amid Russia´s threats of nuclear attack since its war on Ukraine began in February. Russia last week shelled a Ukrainian city close to Europe's largest nuclear plant. Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said, ""Even though we face a severe security environment, we must pursue the history of non-nuclear use and make Nagasaki the last place of nuclear attack."" Japanese officials worry that the conflict may embolden China to be even more assertive in East Asia, and the government is pushing to further step up its military capability and spending. Japan renounces its own possession, production or hosting of nuclear weapons, but as a U.S. ally Japan hosts 50,000 American troops and is protected by the U.S. nuclear umbrella. Still, Russia's nuclear threat has prompted some hawkish lawmakers in the governing party have also proposed a possibility of nuclear sharing with the United States. Taue said discussions about nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation over the past decades have not been put into practice and trust in the 1968 Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons has become ""tenuous."" ""We must recognize that ridding ourselves of nuclear weapons is the only realistic way of protecting the Earth and humankind´s future,"" Taue said. Taue urged Japan's government to exercise leadership in pursuing peace diplomacy that does not rely on nuclear deterrence. ""Nuclear weapons are not deterrence,"" said Takashi Miyata, an 82-year-old survivor, or hibakusha. He said possible nuclear sharing is ""the opposite of our wish."" Air-raid sirens and scenes of bombed-out Ukraine reminded him of the ""pika don,"" or the flash and explosion of the atomic bombing that Miyata experienced at age 5. His uncle and aunt died in the bombing, and his father died of leukemia five years later. Miyata also developed cancer 10 years ago. Many survivors of the bombings have lasting injuries and illnesses resulting from the explosions and radiation exposure and have faced discrimination in Japan. As of March, 118,935 survivors are certified as eligible for government medical support, according to the health and welfare ministry. Their average age now exceeds 84.

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-11094211/Russian-disinformation-spreading-new-ways-despite-bans.html,2022-08-09,Russian disinformation spreading in new ways despite bans,"After Russia invaded Ukraine last February, the European Union moved to block RT and Sputnik, two of the Kremlin's top channels for spreading propaganda and misinformation about the war. Nearly six months later, the number of sites pushing that same content has exploded as Russia found ways to evade the ban. They've rebranded their work to disguise it. They've shifted some propaganda duties to diplomats. And they've cut and pasted much of the content on new websites - ones that until now had no obvious ties to Russia. NewsGuard, a New York-based firm that studies and tracks online misinformation, has now identified 250 websites actively spreading Russian disinformation about the war, with dozens of new ones added in recent months. Claims on these sites include allegations that Ukraine's army has staged some deadly Russian attacks to curry global support, that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is faking public appearances, or that Ukrainian refugees are committing crimes in Germany and Poland. Some of the sites pose as independent think tanks or news outlets. About half are English-language, while others are in French, German or Italian. Many were set up long before the war and were not obviously tied to the Russian government until they suddenly began parroting Kremlin talking points. ""They may be establishing sleeper sites,"" said NewsGuard co-CEO Gordon Crovitz. Sleeper sites are websites created for a disinformation campaign that lay largely dormant, slowly building an audience through innocuous or unrelated posts, and then switching to propaganda or disinformation at an appointed time. FILE - A man looks at a destroyed Russian tank placed as a symbol of war in downtown Kyiv, Ukraine, May 23, 2022. A new report from NewsGuard, a tech firm that tracks disinformation has identified 250 websites actively working to spread Kremlin disinformation.(AP Photo/Natacha Pisarenko, File) While NewsGuard's analysis found that much of the disinformation about the war in Ukraine is coming from Russia, it did find instances of false claims with a pro-Ukrainian bent. They included claims about a hotshot fighter ace known as the Ghost of Kyiv that officials later admitted was a myth. YouTube, TikTok and Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, all pledged to remove RT and Sputnik from their platforms within the European Union. But researchers have found that in some cases all Russia had to do to evade the ban was to post it from a different account. The Disinformation Situation Center, a Europe-based coalition of disinformation researchers, found that some RT video content was showing up on social media under a new brand name and logo. In the case of some video footage, the RT brand was simply removed from the video and reposted on a new YouTube channel not covered by the EU's ban. More aggressive content moderation of social media could make it harder for Russia to circumvent the ban, according to Felix Kartte, a senior adviser at Reset, a U.K.-based nonprofit that has funded the Disinformation Situation Center's work and is critical of social media´s role in democratic discourse. ""Rather than putting effective content moderation systems in place, they are playing whack-a-mole with the Kremlin´s disinformation apparatus,"" Kartte said. YouTube's parent company did not immediately respond to questions seeking comment about the ban. In the EU, officials are trying to shore up their defenses. This spring the EU approved legislation that would require tech companies to do more to root out disinformation. Companies that fail could face big fines. European Commission Vice President Vera Jourova last month called disinformation ""a growing problem in the EU, and we really have to take stronger measures."" The proliferation of sites spreading disinformation about the war in Ukraine shows that Russia had a plan in case governments or tech companies tried to restrict RT and Sputnik. That means Western leaders and tech companies will have to do more than shutter one or two websites if they hope to stop the flow of Kremlin disinformation. ""The Russians are a lot smarter,"" said NewsGuard's other co-CEO, Steven Brill."

The move reflects soaring tensions between Moscow and Washington over Russia´s military action in Ukraine and marks the first time the Kremlin halted U.S. inspections under the New START nuclear arms control treaty. In declaring the freeze on U.S. inspections, the Russian Foreign Ministry said the sanctions on Russian flights imposed by the U.S. and its allies, visa restrictions and other obstacles effectively have made it impossible for Russian military experts to visit U.S. nuclear weapons sites, giving the U.S. ""unilateral advantages."" The Biden administration had no immediate public response to the move. Ankit Panda, an expert on nuclear policy at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, called Russia's action ""a cynical attempt to pressure the United States"" over penalties the West has imposed on Russia over its invasion of Ukraine. ""They basically are using New START inspections - something the U.S. cares about - to force Washington's hands,"" Panda said. Russia claimed that U.S. inspectors have not faced such difficulties, even though Moscow has closed its skies to the European Union´s 27 nations, the U.K. and Canada - though not the U.S. - after the start of the conflict in Ukraine in late February. Russia said at the time that exceptions would be made for diplomatic missions and deliveries of humanitarian aid. The Russian Foreign Ministry claimed that the freeze is temporary and allowed by the pact ""in exceptional cases."" It noted that Russia ""highly values"" the New START, adding that inspections could resume after the problems hampering them are solved. ""Russia is fully committed to abiding by all of the provisions of New START, which we see as a crucial tool for maintaining international security and stability,"" the ministry said, urging a ""thorough study of all existing problems in this area, the successful settlement of which would allow a return to full-scale application as soon as possible of all verification mechanisms of the Treaty."" ""After the problems regarding the resumption of inspection activities under the Treaty are resolved, we will immediately lift the exemptions from inspection activities that we have announced,"" the ministry said. The New START treaty, signed in 2010 by President Barack Obama and Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, limits each country to no more than 1,550 deployed nuclear warheads and 700 deployed missiles and bombers, and envisages sweeping on-site inspections to verify compliance. Just days before the New START was due to expire in February 2021, Russia and the United States agreed to extend it for another five years. Panda, the security analyst, noted that Russia's action also comes during a review conference for the half-century-old Nonproliferation Treaty in New York, where the United States and Russia are discussing continued strategic arms reductions. ""At a time when nuclear risks between the two sides are far from waning, it´s essential that the inspection protocols in the Treaty are fully restored,"" he said. ""The pandemic had its toll on New START inspection activity and Moscow´s unfortunate decision stands to further jeopardize things."" ___ Joanna Kozlowska in London and Ellen Knickmeyer in Washington contributed to this report."

The effort to seize Andrei Skoch´s private plane, an Airbus A319-100, was part of a monthslong pursuit of sanctioned Russian oligarchs and their blocked property, U.S. Attorney Damian Williams announced. Skoch, a steel magnate, is one of the wealthiest men in Russia´s Duma, or parliament. His fortune is valued at about $6.6 billion, according to Forbes. The U.S. Treasury first sanctioned Skoch in April 2018 over his ties to organized crime and for being ""a deputy of the Russian Federation's State Duma."" Following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the U.S. Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control issued additional sanctions against Skoch and his assets, including by identifying the Airbus in June as property in which Skoch had an interest, according to a release from law enforcement authorities. The warrant to seize the plane, which is now in Kazakhstan, was signed by U.S. District Judge Robert W. Lehrburger in New York after a federal agent submitted an affidavit explaining how Skoch is the owner of the Airbus through a series of shell companies and trusts tied to his romantic partner. Authorities said the jet is worth more than $90 million. ""Once again U.S. law enforcement has demonstrated that international shell games will not suffice to hide the fruits of corruption and money laundering,"" said Andrew C. Adams, director of a task force pursing the assets of Russian oligarchs. The United States had already revealed it was seeking to seize a $156 million superyacht, the Madame Gu, belonging to Skoch. The 324-foot (98-meter) yacht has a helicopter pad, gym, beach club and elevator. In June, Treasury issued additional sanctions against Skoch and his assets, banning American entities from conducting business with the superyacht. The yacht is registered in the Cayman Islands but has most recently been docked at Port Rashid in Dubai. Skoch is also sanctioned by the European Union. The United Arab Emirates has not taken sides after Russia's invasion of Ukraine and has welcomed the influx of Russian money to its beachfront villas and luxury hotels. The UAE has become a safe haven for some Russian oligarchs to park their assets. In June, a U.S. court ordered the seizure of two aircraft worth over $400 million believed to be owned by sanctioned Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich. A court filing said that the former Chelsea soccer club owner´s Boeing 787 Dreamliner was in the UAE."

An arbitration committee of the center-left Social Democrats´ branch in Hannover, where Schroeder lives, considered 17 applications from party members for proceedings against him. Schroeder´s longstanding connections to the Russian energy sector and refusal to distance himself fully from President Vladimir Putin after Russia invaded Ukraine have left his political standing in tatters. However, the SPD committee determined his actions don't constitute a breach of the party´s rules, according to dpa. His expulsion from the SPD had been seen as unlikely. In Germany, expelling party members is a complicated and often lengthy process that frequently fails. However, an appeal of Monday´s decision is still possible. Schroeder, who served as chancellor from 1998 to 2005 and was the Social Democrats´ leader from 1999 to 2004, has shown no signs of heeding calls from senior party figures to tone down his rhetoric on Russia or leave the party of his own accord.

""Our strategy is rooted in the recognition that sub-Saharan Africa is a major geopolitical force - one that has shaped our past, is shaping our present, and will shape our future,"" Blinken said at the University of Pretoria in a speech detailing the Biden administration's policies for Africa. ""It´s a strategy that reflects the region´s complexity, its diversity, its agency; and one that focuses on what we will do with African nations and peoples, not for African nations and peoples,"" he said. Blinken said that the United States and African nations ""can´t achieve any of our shared priorities - whether that´s recovering from the pandemic; creating broad-based economic opportunities; addressing the climate crisis; expanding energy access; revitalizing democracies; or strengthening the free and open international order - if we don´t work together, as equal partners."" South African academics and students responded warmly to Blinken´s speech, which was a broad declaration of U.S. intentions toward sub-Saharan Africa. The United States is often faulted for overlooking the continent in recent decades, opening space for Russian and Chinese interests to make significant inroads.

Before his speech, Blinken met in Pretoria, South Africa's administrative capital, with Minister of International Relations Naledi Pandor. Pandor appears to have maintained her country's refusal to criticize Russia for its invasion of Ukraine. Instead, in a press briefing following the meeting, Pandor criticized the U.S. and other Western powers for focusing on the Ukraine conflict to the detriment of other international issues. ""We should be equally concerned at what is happening to the people of Palestine, as we are with what is happening to the people of Ukraine,"" she said. Before the closed-door meeting with Pandor, Blinken had said that the United States' good relations with South Africa would allow them to be frank in discussing their differences. Many African countries have declined to follow the U.S. lead in condemning the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Some were among more than a dozen African governments that have signed security deals with the Wagner Group, a shadowy Russian mercenary group that the U.S. and other countries say is backed by the Kremlin.

Justice Minister Judit Varga wrote Monday on Facebook that an investigation against Ireland-based Ryanair started in June and found ""unfair trade practices,"" triggering a fine of 300 million Hungarian forints ($777,058). The fine is the first tied to the tax, which led Ryanair and others to increase prices and set off a clash with industry. Hungary has said costs should not be passed along to customers. Ryanair says it will ""immediately appeal any baseless fine"" but that it hasn't received notice of one. It pointed to European Union law allowing airlines to set fares for flights within the 27-nation bloc without interference from national governments and says it will appeal to EU courts if needed. Prime Minister Viktor Orban's right-wing nationalist government says industries from banking to insurance to airlines that have enjoyed ""extra profits"" arising from soaring demand after the COVID-19 pandemic should contribute to the country's economic recovery. His government blames the war in Ukraine and EU sanctions against Russia for woes like the skyrocketing energy prices, its currency weakening to record levels and inflation reaching 12.6% in June. The government has said it hopes the tax will raise 815 billion forints ($2.1 billion) to maintain a program that reduces people´s utility bills and bolsters the military.

Russia claimed that Ukrainian shelling caused a power surge and fire and forced staff to lower output from two reactors, while Ukraine has blamed Russian troops for storing weapons there. Nuclear experts have warned that more shelling of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station, which was captured by Russia early in the war, is fraught with danger. The Kremlin echoed that Monday, claiming that Kyiv was attacking the plant and urging Western powers to force a stop to that. ""Shelling of the territory of the nuclear plant by the Ukrainian armed forces is highly dangerous,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters. ""It´s fraught with catastrophic consequences for vast territories, for the entire Europe."" Ukraine's military intelligence spokesman, Andriy Yusov, countered that Russian forces have planted explosives at the plant to head off an expected Ukrainian counteroffensive in the region. Previously, Ukrainian officials have said Russia is launching attacks from the plant and using Ukrainian workers there as human shields. Yusov called on Russia to ""make a goodwill gesture and hand over control of the plant to an international commission and the IAEA (International Atomic Energy Agency), if not to the Ukrainian military."" In this handout photo taken from video and released by Russian Defense Ministry Press Service on Sunday, Aug. 7, 2022, a general view of the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Station in territory under Russian military control, southeastern Ukraine. The Russian military said that Ukrainian shelling of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant on Sunday caused a power surge and fire and forced staff to lower output from two reactors. (Russian Defense Ministry Press Service via AP) Ukraine's ombudsman, Dmytro Lubinets, likewise urged that the United Nations, the IAEA and the international community send a delegation to ""completely demilitarize the territory"" and provide security guarantees to plant employees and the city where the plant is based, Enerhodar. The IAEA is the U.N.´s nuclear watchdog. Its director-general, Rafael Grossi, told The Associated Press last week that the situation surrounding the Zaporizhzhia plant ""is completely out of control,"" and issued an urgent plea to Russia and Ukraine to allow experts to visit the complex to stabilize the situation and avoid a nuclear accident. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres voiced support for that idea Monday, saying, ""any attack to a nuclear plant is a suicidal thing."" One expert in nuclear materials at Imperial College London said the reactor at Zaporizhzhia is modern and housed inside a heavily reinforced steel-and-concrete building designed to protect against disasters. ""As such, I do not believe there would be a high probably of a breach of the containment building, even if it was accidently struck by an explosive shell, and even less likely the reactor itself could be damaged,"" said Mark Wenman at the college's Nuclear Energy Futures. He also said the complex's spent fuel tanks, where the shells reportedly hit, are strong and probably don't contain much spent fuel. ""Although it may seem worrying, and any fighting on a nuclear site would be illegal according to international law, the likelihood of a serious nuclear release is still small,"" he said. Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Lt. Gen. Igor Konashenkov said the attack Sunday caused a power surge and smoke, triggering an emergency shutdown. Fire teams extinguished flames, and the plant´s personnel lowered the output of reactors No. 5 and No. 6 to 500 megawatts, he said. And the head of the Ukrainian company operating the plant said all but one power line connecting it to Ukraine´s energy system had been destroyed. Petro Kotin, head of the Ukrainian state corporation Eherhoatom, blamed Russian shelling and said a blackout would be ""very unsafe for such a nuclear facility."" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy decried ""the shelling and mining"" of the plant and called it ""nuclear blackmail."" He called for sanctions against Moscow´s nuclear industry. As fighting continued on the front lines, the United States on Monday pledged another $1 billion in new military aid for Ukraine. It would be the biggest delivery yet of rockets, ammunition and other arms straight from U.S. Department of Defense stocks for Ukrainian forces. The latest announcement brings total U.S. security assistance committed to Ukraine by the Biden administration to $9.1 billion since Russian troops invaded on Feb. 24. Ukraine´s presidential office said the Russians had shelled seven Ukrainian regions over the previous 24 hours, killing five people. Among the targets, it said, was Nikopol, just across the Dnieper River from the Zaporizhzhia plant. Thousands of people were without electricity there. Russian rockets and artillery also hit across the Sumy region, killing one person, and the Ukrainian governor of the eastern Donetsk region said the cities of Bakhmut, Avdiivka and Lyman had emerged as fighting hotspots. Ukrainian forces struck Russian-controlled areas in the south, officials there said, including the strategic Antonivskiy bridge in the southern city of Kherson. An artery for Russian military supplies, the bridge has been closed in recent weeks because of earlier shelling. Plans to reopen it on Wednesday were now shelved, said Kirill Stremousov, deputy head of the Moscow-appointed administration of the Kherson region. Meanwhile, one of the ships that left Ukraine on Friday under a deal to unblock grain supplies and stave off a global food crisis arrived in Turkey, the first loaded vessel to reach its destination. The Turkey-flagged Polarnet was laden with 12,000 tons of corn. ""This sends a message of hope to every family in the Middle East, Africa, and Asia: Ukraine won´t abandon you,"" Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba tweeted. ""If Russia sticks to its obligations, the `grain corridor´ will keep maintaining global food security."" Twelve ships have now been authorized to sail under the grain deal between Ukraine and Russia, which was brokered by Turkey and the United Nations - 10 outbound and two inbound. Some 322,000 metric tons of agricultural products have left Ukrainian ports, the bulk of it corn but also sunflower oil and soya. Four ships that left Ukraine on Sunday were expected to anchor near Istanbul on Monday evening for inspection to make sure they are carrying only food. The first cargo ship to leave Ukraine, the Sierra Leone-flagged Razoni, which left Odesa on Aug. 1, hit a snag with delivery, however. It was heading for Lebanon with 26,000 metric tons of corn for chicken feed but the corn´s buyer in Lebanon refused to accept the cargo, since it was delivered much later than its contract, Ukraine's embassy in Beirut said. ___ Kareem Chehayeb in Beirut, Mehmet Guzel in Derince, Turkey, and Andrew Wilks in Istanbul contributed. ___ Follow the AP´s coverage of the war at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine In this handout photo taken from video and released by Russian Defense Ministry Press Service on Sunday, Aug. 7, 2022, A rocket fragment after shelling is seen near the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Station in territory under Russian military control, southeastern Ukraine.

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-11090989/Russian-tennis-players-collect-3-titles-US-Open-tuneups.html,2022-08-08,Russian tennis players collect 3 titles at US Open tuneups,"It was quite a week for Russia´s professional tennis players - four tournaments, three titles. One of them, Liudmila Samsonova, thinks it might not be merely a coincidence that this recent run of success for her, Daria Kasatkina and Daniil Medvedev comes shortly after they were banned from competing at Wimbledon because of their country´s invasion of, and ongoing war in, Ukraine. ""We are are all very angry about the situation,"" Samsonova said after beating Estonia´s Kaia Kanepi 4-6, 6-3, 6-3 in the final of the Citi Open on Sunday for her second career WTA title. ""I mean, it was a really tough month."" Samsonova earned her trophy in Washington a day after Medvedev, who leads the men´s rankings, defeated Britain's Cam Norrie for the championship at Los Cabos, Mexico, and several hours before Kasatkina won the title at San Jose, California, with a victory over American Shelby Rogers. All three events are hard-court tuneups ahead of the year´s last Grand Slam tournament, the U.S. Open, which begins in New York on Aug. 29; Medvedev is the defending champion there. (The week's fourth title, the men's event at the Citi Open, was won by Australia's Nick Kyrgios; a Russian, Andrey Rublev, reached the semifinals). At the previous Grand Slam event, Wimbledon, which ran from late June into July, all athletes from Russia and Belarus were blocked by the All England Club from participating because of the attack on Ukraine. That prompted the WTA and ATP professional tours to withhold rankings points from the tournament, meaning whatever was earned there in 2021 fell off a player´s record and could not be replaced with how they fared there this year. ""It's been a great week for us. I wouldn't say that Wimbledon (gave) a lot of motivation to us, because we want to win these tournaments and matches in any case. I think it just happened that, in this particular week, three Russian players won titles. It's not happening very often, let's say,"" said Kasatkina, who has called for an end to the fighting in Ukraine. ""I think it's just a coincidence. It shows that we're on a good level."" Liudmila Samsonova, of Russia, poses with the trophy after she won the final at the Citi Open tennis tournament against Kaia Kanepi, of Estonia, Sunday, Aug. 7, 2022, in Washington. (AP Photo/Nick Wass) When Samsonova arrived in Washington a week ago, her ranking had dropped from a career-best of 25th in May to 60th. And she had not played a match on tour since June. She used that time to go to her training base in Italy and work on her game - and herself. She started collaborating with a mental coach (""I can´t thank her enough,"" Samsonova said Sunday). She sought to improve her topspin forehand, her serve and her return, all of which paid off during a victory over reigning U.S. Open champion Emma Raducanu in the quarterfinals and against Kanepi in the final. Asked Sunday about Wimbledon and the results she and other Russians produced this week, Samsonova said: ""We (had) a lot of time to work, so I think we (used) it very well."" Up until a couple of weeks ago, she was not sure whether she would be able to play in Washington at all. That´s because her visa was due to expire in July and she was told there might not be enough time to complete the application process for a renewal. That might have meant missing not just the Citi Open, but also other tournaments in the country, including perhaps the U.S. Open. (Unlike the All England Club, the U.S. Tennis Association announced it would permit athletes from Russia and Belarus to enter the draws). Fortunately, Samsonova said, it did work out, otherwise she might have gone back to Europe to play in some lower-level events. ""I really don´t know"" what would have happened, she acknowledged. The paperwork came through, Samsonova made it to Washington, and on Sunday night, she was pondering something Medvedev and Kasatkina might have been, too: What´s the proper way to celebrate? ""For sure,"" the 23-year-old Samsonova said, ""some drinks."" ___ AP Sports Writer Janie McCauley in San Jose, California, contributed. ___ More AP tennis: https://apnews.com/hub/tennis and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports Daria Kasatkina, of Russia, kisses the Mubadala Silicon Valley Classic trophy after her 6-7 (2), 6-1, 6-2 victory against Shelby Rogers, of the United States, in San Jose, Calif., Sunday, Aug. 7, 2022.

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-11090947/As-summer-wanes-water-crisis-looms-east-Ukrainian-city.html,2022-08-08,Water crisis looms for eastern Ukrainian city of Sloviansk,"The echo of artillery shells thundering in the distance mingles with the din of people gathered around Sloviansk's public water pumps, piercing the uneasy quiet that smothers the nearly deserted streets of this eastern Ukrainian city. The members of Sloviansk's dwindling population only emerge - a few minutes at a time - to fill up at the pumps that have been the city's only water source for more than two months. Fighting between Ukrainian and Russian forces near the key city in the Donetsk region has damaged vital infrastructure that has cut residents off from gas and water for months. The water flows for now, but fears grow that come winter the city only seven miles (12 kilometers) from Russian-occupied territory could face a humanitarian crisis once the pipes begin to freeze over. ""The water infrastructure was destroyed by the constant battles,"" said Lyubov Mahlii, a 76-year-old widow who gathers 20 liters (around five gallons) of water twice a day from a public tank near her apartment, dragging the plastic bottles up four flights of stairs on her own. ""When there are bombings and sirens, we keep carrying it,"" she said on Sunday. ""It´s a great risk for us, but what can we do?"" Only a fifth of the city's pre-invasion population of 100,000 remains. With heavy fighting raging only miles away as Russian forces continue their push on Donetsk - part of the industrial Donbas region where Moscow-backed separatists have been battling Ukrainian troops since 2014 - residents defy the shelling to make do with the only water source left. And local officials believe things will only get worse once the cold sets in. Lyubov Mahlii, 76, pulls a crate of water bottles up the stairs to her fifth floor apartment after filling them up at a nearby park in Sloviansk, Donetsk region, eastern Ukraine, Saturday, Aug. 6, 2022. A lack of running water in the city means that residents must fill bottles by hand at public pumps. While the remaining population has adapted to this new way of life, local officials warn that the coming of winter could set the stage for a humanitarian crisis. (AP Photo/David Goldman) Locals fill their bottles with hand pumps or from plastic tanks at one of five public wells before hauling them home in bicycle baskets, wheeled carts and even children's strollers. Speaking from her tidy kitchen after one such trip, Mahlii said she boils some water for at least 15 minutes to make sure it's safe for consumption. The remainder is used for bathing, washing clothes and dishes, watering plants and taking care of a stray dog named Chapa. Following the death of her husband, Nikolai, from diabetes four years ago, Mahlii shares her Soviet government-provided apartment with two bright yellow canaries and an assortment of houseplants. Water she had gathered filled the plastic tubs and buckets stacked on every flat surface in her small bathroom, while empty plastic bottles lined the walls in her hallway. A meat and vegetable soup was cooking on an electric burner for lunch. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy issued a mandatory evacuation order to all residents of the Donetsk region at the end of July, saying remaining would cost lives. But despite that and the terror that accompanies the shriek of falling rockets near the city, with no money to relocate and nowhere to go, Mahlii plans to stay in Sloviansk - no matter what. ""I don´t want to leave my apartment because someone else might occupy it,"" she said. ""I don´t want to leave. I will die here."" Another Sloviansk resident, Ninel Kyslovska, 75, gathered water from a tank at a park on Sunday for marinating cucumbers in the sun that afternoon. She said the scarcity had upended all aspects of her life. ""Without water, you won´t get anywhere. I have to carry 60, 80, 100 liters of water a day and it´s still not enough,"" she said. ""Bread and water are sacred and they just took it from people. Such actions must be punished, maybe not by us, but hopefully by God´s judgment."" Filling her bottles, Kyslovska said she sometimes avoids bathing to save herself a trip to the park, and often washes her clothing in a nearby lake. She blamed the local government for the lack of running water, complaining that nearby Kramatorsk - just six miles (10 kilometers) to the south - still had water flowing from its taps. But Oleksandr Goncharenko, the head of Kramatorsk's military administration, said even that comparative luxury was threatened by winter, when the temperature drops to -20 C (-4 F). ""All these wells and pumps will freeze,"" Goncharenko said, adding that places like Sloviansk and Kramatorsk - which also has no gas - had become ""hostages of destroyed infrastructure."" Goncharenko said Kramatorsk would drain municipal pipes that run into unheated structures to prevent them from freezing and bursting, and that he was ""99% certain"" that gas wouldn't be restored before winter. Electricity cuts and the lack of heating could also see the fire risk soar as people try to heat and light their homes by other means, he added. Ukrainian officials are still trying to convince the Donetsk region's remaining residents to evacuate as the war's front line threatens to move westward and the inhospitable winter looms. Officials in Kramatorsk plan to build more public wells to supply the remaining population, but Goncharenko warned the water quality couldn't be guaranteed. Such water would likely be sourced from deep underground, he said, which would be too high in calcium and unfit for drinking. Mahlii hasn´t made plans for what she´ll do once cold weather arrives, but after 47 years in her Sloviansk apartment, she will face whatever comes from her home. ""We are surviving!"" she said.

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-11090859/Australia-calls-cooling-Taiwan-Strait-tensions.html,2022-08-08,Australia calls for cooling of Taiwan Strait tensions,"Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong on Monday called for a cooling of tensions after Beijing accused her of ""finger-pointing"" in her criticism of China´s military exercises in response to U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi´s visit to Taiwan. Wong criticized China´s launch of ballistic missiles during the ongoing air and sea drills around Taiwan, which Beijing claims as part of its territory. She also signed a joint statement with the United States and Japan on Saturday that condemned firing of missiles into Japanese exclusive economic zones and accused China of ""raising tension and destabilizing the region."" The Chinese Embassy in Australia replied to the trilateral statement, saying: ""It is absolutely unacceptable for the finger-pointing on China´s justified actions to safeguard state sovereignty and territorial integrity."" The embassy accused Australia of doing the bidding of the United States, which China described as the ""biggest saboteur and destabilizer of peace in the Taiwan Strait and the biggest troublemaker to regional stability."" ""We ... hope that the Australian side could treat the Taiwan question with caution, does not follow certain countries´ strategy of containing China with Taiwan, and does not create new troubles and disturbances in China-Australia relations,"" an embassy statement said. Wong declined to comment on the state of the Sino-Australian relationship following Pelosi´s visit last week. Beijing had signaled a potential reset in the relationship following the new Australian government´s election in May. Relations had plumbed new depths during the previous government´s nine years in power. Australia's Foreign Minister Penny Wong gestures during a press conference at Parliament House in Canberra, Monday, Aug. 8, 2022. Wong has called for a cooling of tensions after Beijing accused her of ""finger-pointing"" in her criticisms of China's military response to U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's visit to Taiwan. (Mick Tsikas/AAP Image via AP) ""What is most critical at the moment is that the temperature is lowered and calm is restored when it comes to cross-strait tensions,"" Wong told reporters. ""Australia continues to urge restraint, Australia continues to urge de-escalation, and this is not something that solely Australia is calling for, and the whole region is concerned about the current situation, the whole region is calling for stability to be restored,"" Wong added. Asked how Australia was a developing foreign policy independent of the United States, Wong told reporters: ""Australia is always guided by our national interests."" She later hosted U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman at Parliament House. Sherman came to Australia after visiting Solomon Islands, Samoa and Tonga - South Pacific island nations where China is increasing its influence. Sherman said at the outset of talks with Wong that the United States and Australia ""share a commitment in deepening cooperation with the Pacific islands who are critical partners."" Wong´s call for restraint was backed by Latvian Foreign Minister Edgars Rinkevics, who was in the Australian capital Canberra for the opening of a new embassy. Rinkevics drew parallels between Chinese military assertiveness over Taiwan with Russia´s invasion of Ukraine. ""It is very important to understand that China is also very carefully watching what is happening in Europe, what is happening in Ukraine,"" he said. ""It is very important that we work together and we provide the same kind of message of the need to have a restraint, not to overreact in their actions and not to create another regional and global hotspot."" Latvia wants Russia declared a state sponsor of terrorism and has urged other countries to follow the Latvian lead by denying all Russians any type of visa.

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-11090705/One-year-Afghanistan-spy-agencies-pivot-China.html,2022-08-08,"One year after Afghanistan, spy agencies pivot toward China","In a recent closed-door meeting with leaders of the agency´s counterterrorism center, the CIA´s No. 2 official made clear that fighting al-Qaida and other extremist groups would remain a priority - but that the agency´s money and resources would be increasingly shifted to focusing on China. One year after ending the war in Afghanistan, President Joe Biden and top national security officials speak less about counterterrorism and more about the political, economic and military threats posed by China as well as Russia. There´s been a quiet pivot within intelligence agencies, which are moving hundreds of officers to China-focused positions, including some who were previously working on terrorism. Intelligence officials stress that the counterterrorism fight is hardly being ignored. Just a week ago, it was revealed that a CIA drone attack killed al-Qaida leader Ayman al-Zawahri in Kabul. But days later, China staged large-scale military exercises and threatened to cut off contacts with the U.S. over House Speaker Nancy Pelosi´s visit to Taiwan. It underscored the message CIA deputy director David Cohen had delivered at that meeting weeks ago: The agency´s top priority is trying to understand and counter Beijing. The U.S. has long been alarmed by China´s growing political and economic ambitions. China has tried to influence foreign elections, mounted campaigns of cyber and corporate espionage, and detained millions of minority Uyghurs in camps. Some experts also think Beijing will in coming years try to seize the self-ruled democratic island of Taiwan by force. Intelligence officials have said they need more insights on China, including after being unable to definitively pinpoint the cause of the COVID-19 pandemic. Beijing has been accused of withholding information about the origins of the virus. And the war in Ukraine has underscored Russia's importance as a target. The U.S. used declassified information to expose Russian President Vladimir Putin's war plans before the invasion and rally diplomatic support for Kyiv. FILE - President Joe Biden speaks from the Blue Room Balcony of the White House Monday, Aug. 1, 2022, in Washington, as he announces that a U.S. airstrike killed al-Qaida leader Ayman al-Zawahri in Afghanistan. One year after ending the war in Afghanistan, Biden and top national security officials speak less about counterterrorism and more about the political, economic, and military threats posed by China as well as Russia. (Jim Watson/Pool via AP, File) Supporters of the Biden administration approach note that the fact the U.S. was able to track and kill al-Zawahri is evidence of its capabilities to target threats in Afghanistan from abroad. Critics say the fact that al-Zawahri was living in Kabul, under the apparent protection of the Taliban, suggests there's a resurgence of extremist groups that America is ill-equipped to counter. The shift in priorities is supported by many former intelligence officers and lawmakers from both parties who say it´s overdue. That includes people who served in Afghanistan and other missions against al-Qaida and other terrorist groups. Rep. Jason Crow, a former Army Ranger who served in Afghanistan and Iraq, said he believed the U.S. had been overly focused on counterterrorism over the last several years. ""A far greater existential threat is Russia and China,"" said Crow, a Colorado Democrat who serves on the House Intelligence and Armed Services committees. Terrorist groups, he said, ""will not destroy the American way of life ... the way China can."" CIA spokesperson Tammy Thorp noted that terrorism ""remains a very real challenge."" ""Even as crises such as Russia´s invasion of Ukraine and strategic challenges such as that posed by the People´s Republic of China demand our attention, CIA will continue to aggressively track terrorist threats globally and work with partners to counter them,"" Thorp said. Congress has pushed the CIA and other intelligence agencies to make China a top priority, according to several people familiar with the matter who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive intelligence matters. Pushing resources toward China has required cuts elsewhere, including in counterterrorism. Specific figures were unavailable because intelligence budgets are classified. In particular, lawmakers want more information about China's development in advanced technologies. Under President Xi Jinping, China has committed trillions of dollars in investment on quantum science, artificial intelligence and other technologies that are likely to disrupt how future wars are fought and economies are structured. As part of the shift, congressional committees are trying to better track how intelligence agencies spend their funding on China, seeking more detail about how specific programs contribute to that mission, one person familiar with the matter said. ""We are late, but it's good that we're finally changing our focus into that region,"" said Rep. Chris Stewart, a Utah Republican who serves on the House Intelligence Committee. ""That means in people, in resources, in military assets, and in diplomacy."" The CIA last year announced it would create two new ""mission centers"" - one on China, one on emerging technologies - to centralize and improve intelligence collection on those issues. The CIA is also trying to recruit more Chinese speakers and reduce wait times on security clearances to hire new people faster. Inside the agency, many officers are learning Chinese and moving into new roles focused on China, though not all of those jobs require language training, people familiar with the matter said. Officials note that intelligence officers are trained to adapt to new challenges and that many were moved more quickly into counterterrorism roles after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. Advances from counterterrorism work - including better use of data and different sources of intelligence to build networks and identify targets - are also useful in countering Russia and China, former officers said. ""It´s the analytics and targeting machine that has become extraordinary,"" said Douglas Wise, a former CIA senior officer who was deputy chief of operations at the counterterrorism center. The CIA's Counterterrorism Center, renamed the Counterterrorism Mission Center in a 2015 reorganization, remains a point of pride for many people who credit its work for keeping Americans safe from terrorism after Sept. 11. CIA officers landed in Afghanistan on Sept. 26, 2001, and were part of operations to displace the Taliban and find and kill leaders of al-Qaida including Osama bin Laden. And 13 years after a double agent tricked officers pursuing al-Zawahri and blew himself up, killing seven agency employees, the CIA killed him in a strike with no reported civilian casualties. The CIA was also involved in some of the darkest moments of the fight against terrorism. It operated secret ""black site"" jails to hold terrorism suspects, some wrongly, and was found by a Senate investigation to have used interrogation methods that amounted to torture. Elite Afghan special operations units trained by the CIA were also accused of killing civilians and violating international law. There's long been a debate over whether counterterrorism pulled intelligence agencies too far away from traditional spying and whether some of the CIA's work in targeting terrorists should instead be done by special forces under the military. Marc Polymeropoulos is a retired CIA operations officer and former base chief in Afghanistan. He said he supports a greater focus on China and Russia but added, ""There´s no reason to diminish what we had to do."" ""This notion that somehow all the CT work we did, somehow that was wrong, that we took our eye of the ball - just remember on Sept. 12 what everyone was feeling,"" he said. Re-orienting the agencies toward more of a focus on China and Russia will ultimately take years and require both patience and recognition that the agency´s culture will take time to change, Wise said. ""For decades, we have been doing counterterrorism,"" Wise said. ""We´ve got to have a rational plan to make this adaptation, which doesn´t take so long that our enemies can exploit a glacial process.""

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-11090695/Asian-stocks-mixed-US-job-gain-paves-way-rate-hike.html,2022-08-08,Asian stocks mixed after US job gain paves way for rate hike,"Asian stocks were mixed on Monday after strong U.S. jobs data cleared the way for more interest rate hikes and China reported its exports rose by double digits. Shanghai and Tokyo advanced while Hong Kong and Seoul retreated. Oil prices edged higher. Wall Street's benchmark S&P 500 lost 0.2% on Friday after government data showed American employers added more jobs than expected in June. That undercut expectations a slowing economy might prompt the Fed to postpone or scale back plans for more rate hikes to cool inflation. ""Now it seems they will be debating whether they need to be even more aggressive,"" Edward Moya of Oanda said in a report. The Shanghai Composite Index shed less than 0.1% to 3,226.04 after China's July exports rose 18%, beating forecasts. The Hang Seng in Hong Kong fell 0.7% to 20,055.39 while the Nikkei 225 in Tokyo gained 0.2% to 28,241.09. The Kospi in Seoul declined 0.3% to 2,482.32 and Sydney's S&P-ASX 200 shed 0.1% to 7,005.40.

(AP Photo/Ahn Young-joon) On Wall Street, the S&P 500 declined to 4,145.19 on Friday while the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.2% to 32,803.47. The Nasdaq composite lost 0.5% at 12,657.55. Investors worry that tighter policy from the Fed and central banks in Europe and Asia to cool inflation that is running at multi-decade highs might derail global economic growth. Markets also have been rattled by Russia´s war on Ukraine, which has caused prices of oil, wheat and other commodities to spike and by uncertainty about the impact of Chinese anti-virus curbs that have disrupted manufacturing and shipping. China´s exports in July surged 18% compared with a year earlier while imports rose just 2.3%, reflecting weak global demand, customs data showed Sunday. The country´s global trade surplus swelled to a record $101 billion. Last week's strong U.S. employment data gave ammunition to Fed officials who say the economy can tolerate higher borrowing costs to cool inflation. After Friday's announcement, traders expect the Fed to raise its benchmark rate by 0.75 percentage points next month, up from forecasts of half a point. That would be triple the usual margin and the third such outsize hike this year. Higher interest rates are meant to dampen inflation by cooling business activity, but that also raises the risk of recession and job losses. The latest inflation spike is unusual because forecasters blame shortages of goods due to the coronavirus pandemic, rather than rapid economic growth. Wall Street is coming off the best month for stocks since late 2020, a rally driven mostly by what had been falling bond yields. Traders hoped the economy was slowing enough for the Fed to ease off. In energy markets, benchmark U.S. crude edged up 7 cents to $89.08 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract rose 47 cents to $89.01 on Friday. Brent crude, the price basis for international trading, added 1 cent to $94.93 per barrel in London. It gained 80 cents to $94.92 the previous session. The dollar rose to 135.28 yen from Friday's 135.11 yen. The euro advanced to $1.0181 from $1.0178.

Then, catching himself, the Wimbledon runner-up added with a knowing smile: ""The relationship's still rocky with the umpires."" Kyrgios extended the best stretch of his career and gave another performance that will make him someone to take seriously at the U.S. Open, saving the only break point he faced in the final along the way to a 6-4, 6-3 victory over Yoshihito Nishioka at the Citi Open. ""I feel like my motivation is a lot higher than it used to be. ... There is a small window; I should capitalize on it,"" said Kyrgios, who dropped to his back on the blue court when the match ended, then headed back out into that stadium in the evening to team with Jack Sock for a doubles trophy, too, defeating French Open finalists Ivan Dodig and Austin Krajicek 7-5, 6-4. ""I don´t care about what people say about my tennis, like, `Always disrespectful to the sport,´ all this, all that,"" said Kyrgios, the first man to win Washington's singles and doubles events in the same year. ""I know that, deep down, I try really hard to do it my own way. I know that I inspire millions of people, and I´m just playing for them."" Earlier Sunday, Liudmila Samsonova won her second career WTA title by coming back to beat sixth-seeded Kaia Kanepi 4-6, 6-3, 6-3 in the Citi Open women´s final. Nick Kyrgios, of Australia, lies on the court after he defeated Yoshihito Nishioka, of Japan, during a final at the Citi Open tennis tournament Sunday, Aug. 7, 2022, in Washington. Kyrgios won 6-4, 6-3.(AP Photo/Nick Wass) Kyrgios' seventh career tour-level singles championship came where his sixth did in 2019 - on the hard courts of the American capital in a tuneup for Flushing Meadows. As usual when Kyrgios is on his game, the serve led the way: He hit 12 aces and won 22 of 25 first-serve points. He won all nine of his service games against Nishioka, making him 64 for 64 in the tournament, wrapping up the week by saving all 10 of his opponents' break points. The only one Kyrgios had to deal with Sunday came at 3-2 in the first set, and Kyrgios dismissed it via a volley winner. ""I couldn't figure out his service game,"" said Nishioka, who ranked Kyrgios No. 1 on tour in that category and also praised the 27-year-old Australian for being ""more focused"" than earlier in his career. Kyrgios managed to break Japan's Nishioka, who is ranked 96th and eliminated top-seeded Andrey Rublev in the semifinals, three times - in the opening game of each set and again in the match's final game. This marks quite a bit of unusual consistency for Kyrgios, coming off a run to his first Grand Slam final at the All England Club, where he lost to Novak Djokovic. Kyrgios did not get any rankings points for that showing - there were no points awarded to anyone at Wimbledon - but the singles title in Washington will push him from 63rd to 37th, within shouting range of a possible seeding at the U.S. Open. ""Hopefully,"" Kyrgios said, ""I can keep this momentum going."" Play begins at Flushing Meadows on Aug. 29. That is less than a week after a court hearing in Australia is scheduled for a common assault allegation against Kyrgios. Samsonova is a 23-year-old Russian who reached a career-best ranking of 25th in May but is currently 60th after needing to sit out part of the season, including Wimbledon, because of her country´s attack on Ukraine. She used a powerful serve that reached 119 mph against Kanepi to make her way through the bracket at the hard-court tournament, including a victory over reigning U.S. Open champion Emma Raducanu. Samsonova´s other championship came last year at a grass-court tournament in Berlin. Kanepi, a 37-year-old from Estonia, was seeking her first trophy since 2013. She left the court for a medical timeout in the third set Sunday because of what she said was an abdominal muscle problem. ""I guess a lot of matches and a lot of serving this week,"" Kanepi said. Kyrgios' victory was shown on Tennis Channel, which shunted the women´s final off its main station and instead aired pickleball - because, tournament chairman Mark Ein said, of a prior commitment. This was big-serve, quick-strike tennis between a pair of women with similar playing styles on a humid, 90-degree Fahrenheit (32 Celsius) afternoon. Some spectators held umbrellas to provide shade; portable electric fans were placed next to sideline seats to offer a bit of respite to the players during changeovers; Samsonova held a plastic bag filled with ice atop her head. ___ More AP tennis: https://apnews.com/hub/tennis and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports Nick Kyrgios, of Australia, pauses on the court after he beat Yoshihito Nishioka, of Japan, during a final at the Citi Open tennis tournament Sunday, Aug. 7, 2022, in Washington.

Blinken´s visit to Africa is seen as part of a competition between Russia and Western powers for support from African countries over the war in Ukraine. His trip to Africa follows recent tours by Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and French President Emmanuel Macron. South Africa is one of many African countries that have maintained a neutral stance on the war and have not publicly criticized Russia. After an early morning arrival, Blinken visited the Hector Pieterson memorial in Soweto township, on the outskirts of Johannesburg, which honors a student killed in 1976 when protesting South Africa´s regime of racial oppression, apartheid, which ended in 1994. Blinken laid a wreath at the memorial accompanied by Pieterson´s sister, Antoinette Sithole. He also toured the museum, which contains artifacts, photographs and videos of South Africa´s struggle against apartheid. ""Hector´s story is one that really resonates because we have our own struggle for freedom and equality in the United States and South Africa´s story is unique but there are also so many common elements, and that resonates powerfully,"" said Blinken.

(AP Photo/Andrew Harnik, Pool) Sithole, who also participated in the 1976 student protests, said the museum is a highlights the role played by South Africa´s youth in bringing an end to white minority rule in the country. ""The museum is a reminder for generations to come. We must know where we come from and where we are going, and don´t forget that the youth took a stand for us to be better today,"" said Sithole. On Monday, Blinken will describe the United States´ strategies for sub-Saharan Africa in a major policy speech at the University of Pretoria. Africa has been hard-hit by the effect of the global COVID-19 pandemic and the rising food and oil prices caused by Russia´s war in Ukraine. Blinken will also hold a press conference Monday with South Africa's Minister of International Relations Naledi Pandor in which the two countries' different positions on the Ukraine war are expected to be visible. Blinken will go on to visit Congo and Rwanda this week to end his international tour which also took him to Cambodia and the Philippines.

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-11089077/Shift-wars-seen-ships-cleared-leave-Ukraine.html,2022-08-07,Shift in war's front seen as grain leaves Ukraine; plant hit,"Six more ships carrying agricultural cargo held up by the war in Ukraine received authorization Sunday to leave the country´s Black Sea coast as analysts warned that Russia was moving troops and equipment in the direction of the southern port cities to stave off a Ukrainian counteroffensive. Ukraine and Russia also accused each other of shelling Europe's largest nuclear power plant. The loaded vessels were cleared to depart from Chornomorsk and Odesa, according to the Joint Coordination Center, which oversees an international deal intended to get some 20 million tons of grain out of Ukraine to feed millions going hungry in Africa, the Middle East and parts of Asia. Ukraine, Russia, Turkey and the United Nations signed the agreements last month to create a 111-nautical-mile sea corridor that would allow cargo ships to travel safely out of ports that Russia´s military had blockaded and through waters that Ukraine´s military had mined. Implementation of the deal, which is in effect for four months, has proceeded slowly since the first ship embarked on Aug. 1. Four of the carriers cleared Sunday to leave Ukraine were transporting more than 219,000 tons of corn. The fifth was carrying more than 6,600 tons of sunflower oil and the sixth 11,000 tons of soya, the Joint Coordination Center said. Three other cargo ships that left Friday passed their inspections and received clearance Sunday to pass through Turkey´s Bosporus Strait on the way to their final destinations, the Center said. A man takes a picture as the Glory bulk carrier makes its way from the port in Odesa, Ukraine, Sunday, Aug. 7, 2022. According to Ukraine's Ministry of Infrastructure, the ship under the Marshall Islands' flag is carrying 66 thousand tons of Ukrainian corn. (AP Photo/Nina Lyashonok) However, the vessel that left Ukraine last Monday with great fanfare as the first under the grain exports deal had its scheduled arrival in Lebanon delayed Sunday, according to a Lebanese Cabinet minister and the Ukraine Embassy. The cause of the delay was not immediately clear. Ukrainian officials were initially skeptical of a grain export deal, citing suspicions that Moscow would try to exploit shipping activity to mass troops offshore or send long-range missiles from the Black Sea, as it has done multiple times during the war. The agreements call for ships to leave Ukraine under military escort and to undergo inspections to make sure they carry only grain, fertilizer or food and not any other commodities. Inbound cargo vessels are checked to ensure they are not carrying weapons. In a weekend analysis, Britain's Defense Ministry said the Russian invasion that started Feb. 24 ""is about to enter a new phase"" in which the fighting would shift to a roughly 350-kilometer (217-mile) front line extending from near the city of Zaporizhzhia to Russian-occupied Kherson. That area includes the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Station which came under fire late Saturday. Each side accused the other of the attack. Ukraine´s nuclear power plant operator, Energoatom, said Russian shelling damaged three radiation monitors around the storage facility for spent nuclear fuels and that one worker was injured. Russian news agencies, citing the separatist-run administration of the plant, said Ukrainian forces fired those shells. Russian forces have occupied the power station for months. Russian soldiers there took shelter in bunkers before Saturday´s attack, according to Energoatom. Rafael Grossi, director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, recently warned that the way the plant was being run and the fighting going on around it posed grave health and environmental threats. For the last four months of the war, Russia has concentrated on capturing the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine, where pro-Moscow separatists have controlled some territory as self-proclaimed republics for eight years. Russian forces have made gradual headway in the region while launching missile and rocket attacks to curtail the movements of Ukrainian fighters elsewhere. The Russians ""are continuing to accumulate large quantities of military equipment"" in a town across the Dnieper River from Russian-held Kherson, according to the Institute for the Study of War, a Washington think tank. Citing local Ukrainian officials, it said the preparations appeared designed to defend logistics routes to the city and establish defensive positions on the river´s left bank. Kherson came under Russian control early in the war and Ukrainian officials have vowed to retake it. It is just 227 kilometers (141 miles) from Odesa, home to Ukraine´s biggest port, so the conflict escalating there could have repercussions for the international grain deal. The city of Mykolaiv, a shipbuilding center that Russian forces bombard daily, is even closer to Odesa. The Mykolaiv region´s governor, Vitaliy Kim, said an industrial facility on the regional capital´s outskirts came under fire early Sunday. Over the past day, five civilians were killed by Russian and separatist firing on cities in the Donetsk region, the part of Donbas still under Ukrainian control, the regional governor, Serhiy Haidai, reported. He and Ukrainian government officials have repeatedly urged civilians to evacuate. ___ Andrew Wilks contributed reporting from Istanbul. ___ Follow AP's coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine A resident fills up water bottles at a well in Sloviansk, Donetsk region, eastern Ukraine, Saturday, Aug. 6, 2022.

It was supposed to arrive in the northern port of Tripoli at about 10 a.m. Sunday. According to Marine Traffic, the ship Saturday changed its status to ""order"" meaning the ship was waiting for someone to buy the corn. The Ukrainian embassy in Beirut said the arrival of the ship has been postponed adding that an ""update for the ceremony will be sent later when we get information about exact day and time of the arrival of the ship."" The shipment that was supposed to arrive in Lebanon comes at a time when the tiny Mediterranean nation is suffering from a food security crisis, with soaring food inflation, wheat shortages and bread lines. The ship is carrying some 26,000 tons of corn for chicken feed.

(AP Photo/Emrah Gurel) The passage of the vessel was the first under a breakthrough deal brokered by Turkey and the United Nations with Russia and Ukraine. The four sides signed deals last month to create safe Black Sea shipping corridors to export Ukraine´s desperately needed agricultural products as Russia´s war upon its neighbor grinds on. Lebanon´s worst economic crisis in its modern history that began in late 2019 has left three-quarters of its population living in poverty while the Lebanese pound has lost more than 90% of its value. The economic meltdown rooted in decades of corruption and mismanagement was made worse by a massive blast in August 2020 that destroyed Beirut´s port and the country´s main grain silos inside the sprawling facility. Large parts of the silos collapsed in recent days after fire caused by remnants of grain that started fermenting and ignited in the summer heat last month. Lebanese officials said last week that the Razoni was supposed to leave Ukraine and head to Lebanon on Feb. 24 but the departure was delayed by the war that broke out days later. On Friday, three more ships carrying thousands of tons of corn left Ukrainian ports and traveled through mined waters toward inspection of their delayed cargo, a sign that the international deal to export grain held up since Russia invaded Ukraine was slowly progressing. Four more ships carrying agricultural cargo held up by the war in Ukraine received authorization Sunday to leave the country´s Black Sea ports.

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-11088837/Ukrainian-risks-life-rescue-wild-animals-war.html,2022-08-07,Ukrainian risks her life to rescue wild animals from war,"Natalia Popova has found a new purpose in life: Rescuing wild animals and pets from the devastation wrought by the war in Ukraine. ""They are my life,"" says the 50-year-old, stroking a light-furred lioness like a kitten. From inside an enclosure, the animal rejoices at the attention, lying on her back and stretching her paws up toward her caretaker. Popova, in cooperation with the animal protection group UA Animals, has already saved more than 300 animals from the war; 200 of them went abroad and 100 found new homes in western Ukraine, which is considered safer. Many of them were wild animals who were kept as pets at private homes before their owners fled Russian shelling and missiles. Popova´s shelter in the Kyiv region village of Chubynske now houses 133 animals. It's a broad menagerie, including 13 lions, a leopard, a tiger, three deer, wolves, foxes, raccoons and roe deer, as well as domesticated animals like horses, donkeys, goats, rabbits, dogs, cats and birds. The animals awaiting evacuation to Poland were rescued from hot spots such as eastern Ukraine's Kharkiv and Donetsk regions, which see daily bombardments and active fighting. The Ukrainian soldiers who let Popova know when animals near the front lines need help joke that she has many lives, like a cat. ""No one wants to go there. Everyone is afraid. I am also scared, but I go anyway,"" she said. Natalia Popova, 50, pets a lion at her animal shelter in Kyiv region, Ukraine, Thursday, Aug. 4, 2022. Popova, in cooperation with the animal protection organisation UA Animals, has already saved more than 300 animals from the war, 200 of them were sent abroad, and 100 found a home in most western regions of Ukraine, which are considered to be safer. (AP Photo/Efrem Lukatsky) Often she is trembling in the car on her way to rescue another wild animal. ""I feel very sorry for them. I can imagine the stress animals are under because of the war, and no one can help them,"" Popova said. In most cases, she knows nothing about the animals she rescues, neither their names and ages nor their owners. ""Animals don´t introduce themselves when they come to us,"" she joked. For the first months of the war, Popova drove to war hot spots alone, but a couple from UA Animals recently offered to transport and help her. ""Our record is an evacuation in 16 minutes, when we saved a lion between Kramatorsk and Sloviansk,"" Popova said. An economist by education with no formal veterinary experience, she administered anesthesia on the lion because the animal had to be put to sleep before it could be transported. Popova says she has always been very attached to animals. In kindergarten, she built houses for worms and talked to birds. In 1999, she opened the first private horse club in Ukraine. But it wasn't until four years ago that she saved her first lion. An organization against slaughterhouses approached her with a request for help saving a lion with a broken spine. She did not know how she could help because her expertise was in horses. But when she saw a photo of the big cat, Popova could not resist. She built an enclosure and took in the lion the next morning, paying the owner. Later, Popova created a social media page titled ""Help the Lioness,"" and people began to write asking for help saving other wild animals. Yana, the first lioness she rescued, has become a family member since she could not find a new home due to a disability. Popova took care of her until she died two weeks ago. The shelter is just a temporary stop for the animals. Popova rehabilitates them and then looks for new homes for them. She feels a special connection with each big cat, but says she does not mind letting them go. ""I love them, and I understand that I do not have the resources to provide them with the comfortable life they deserve,"" says Popova. At first, she bankrolled the shelter with her own funds from the horse business. But since Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24, the horse business has not been profitable. With more than $14,000 a month needed to keep animals healthy and fed, she has turned to borrowing, and seen her debt grow to $200,000. She gets some money from UA Animals and from donations, but worries about how to keep everything together have kept her up at night. ""But I will still borrow money, go to hot spots and save animals. I can´t say no to them,"" she said. Popova sends all her animals to the Pozna´n Zoo in Poland, which helps her evacuate them and find them new homes. Some animals have already been transported to Spain, France and South Africa. Her next project is sending 12 lions to Poland this week. With no end to the fighting in sight, Popova knows she will still be needed. ""My mission in this war is to save wild animals,"" she says. ___ Follow all AP stories on the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine.

Both cities of Bakhmut and Avdiivka have been considered key targets of Russia´s ongoing offensive across Ukraine´s east, with analysts saying Moscow needs to take Bakhmut if it is to advance on the regional hubs of Sloviansk and Kramatorsk. ""In the Donetsk direction, the enemy is conducting an offensive operation, concentrating its main efforts on the Bakhmut and Avdiivka directions. It uses ground attack and army aviation,"" the Ukrainian General Staff said on Facebook. The last Russian strike on Sloviansk was July 30, but Ukrainian forces are fortifying their positions around the city in expectation of new fighting. ""I think it won´t be calm for long. Eventually, there will be an assault,"" Col. Yurii Bereza, head of the volunteer national guard regiment, told The Associated Press. Russian shelling killed five civilians and injured 14 others in the Donetsk region in the last day, Donetsk governor Pavlo Kyrylenko wrote Saturday on Telegram, saying two people were killed in Poprosny, and one each in Avdiivka, Soledar and Pervomaiskiy.

(AP Photo/Evgeniy Maloletka) The governor of the eastern Dnipropetrovsk region said three civilians were injured after Russian rockets fell on a residential neighborhood in Nikopol, a city across the Dnieper River from the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station. The nuclear plant has been under Russian control since Moscow´s troops seized it early in the war. ""After midnight, the Russian army struck the Nikopol area with (Soviet-era) Grad rockets, and the Kryvyi Rih area from barrel artillery,"" Valentyn Reznichenko wrote on Telegram. Another Russian missile attack overnight damaged unspecified infrastructure in the regional capital of Zaporizhzhia. On Thursday, Russia fired 60 rockets at Nikopol, damaging 50 residential buildings in the city of 107,000 and leaving residents without electricity. Rafael Grossi, head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, warned this week that the situation was becoming more perilous day by day at the Zaporizhzhia plant. ""Every principle of nuclear safety has been violated"" at the plant, he said. ""What is at stake is extremely serious."" He expressed concern about the way the plant is being operated and the danger posed by the fighting going on around it. Experts at the U.S.-based Institute for the Study of War said Russia is shelling the area intentionally, ""putting Ukraine in a difficult position."" The Ukrainian company operating the nuclear power station said Saturday that Russian troops are using the plant´s basement to hide from Ukrainian shelling and have barred its Ukrainian staff from going there. ""Ukrainian personnel do not yet have access to these premises, so in the event of new shelling, people have no shelter and are in danger,"" Enerhoatom, a Ukrainian state enterprise, said on its Telegram channel. Enerhoatom said Friday that Russian rockets had damaged the plant's facilities, including a nitrogen-oxygen unit and a high-voltage power line. Local Russian-appointed officials acknowledged the damage, but blamed it on the Ukrainians. In other developments: __ In Ukraine´s south, two civilians were seriously injured Saturday after Russian forces fired rockets on the Black Sea port of Mykolaiv before dawn, according to regional authorities. That followed a Friday afternoon attack on Mykolaiv that killed one person and wounded 21 others. __In the Kherson region south of Mykolaiv, the deputy mayor of the Russia-occupied city of Nova Kakhovka was in critical condition after an assassination attempt, the Russian state news agency RIA-Novosti said, citing the deputy head of the Kherson region, most of which is under Russian control. __The first of three more ships carrying thousands of tons of corn from Ukraine anchored north of Istanbul on Saturday awaiting inspection, the Turkish Defense Ministry said. The Panama-flagged Navi Star, which is carrying 33,000 tons of grain to Ireland, left Odesa on Friday. It is being followed by the Turkish-flagged Polarnet and the Maltese-flagged Rojen, carrying over 25,000 tons of corn between them from Chornomorsk. The joint inspection center was set up to get grain blocked in Ukraine by the war to the world. On Friday, the center inspected its first north-bound ship as it headed for Chornomorsk. __In the north, Ukraine´s second-largest city of Kharkiv and its surrounding area also came under Russian rocket fire again overnight, according to regional governor Oleh Syniehubov. A 18-year-old in Chuhuiv, a town near Kharkiv, had to be hospitalized Saturday after he picked up an unexploded shell. Both Chuhuiv and Kharkiv are near the Russian border and have endured sustained Russian shelling in recent weeks. __The neighboring Sumy region, which also borders Russia, has also seen near-constant shelling and missile strikes. Its governor said Saturday the region was hit more than 60 times from Russian territory over the previous day, and one wounded civilian had to be hospitalized. __ On the ammunition front, Russia has begun using Iranian combat drones in the war, Ukrainian presidential adviser Oleksiy Arestovych said in a YouTube adding that Tehran had transferred 46 drones to the Russian army. ___ Joanna Kozlowska contributed from London. ___ Follow all AP stories on the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine.

In a statement posted Friday night on Facebook, Oksana Pokalchuk accused her former employer of disregarding Ukraine´s wartime realities and the concerns of local staff members who had pushed for the report to be reworked. The report, released Thursday, drew angry denouncements from top Ukrainian officials and criticism from Western diplomats, who accused the authors of making vague claims that appeared to equate the Ukrainian military's defensive actions to the tactics of the invading Russians. ""It is painful to admit, but I and the leadership of Amnesty International have split over values,"" Pokalchuk wrote. ""I believe that any work done for the good of society should take into account the local context, and think through consequences."" Russia has repeatedly justified attacks on civilian areas by alleging that Ukrainian fighters had set up firing positions at the targeted locations. Pokalchuk said her office had asked the organization´s leadership to give the Ukrainian Defense Ministry adequate time to respond to the report's findings and argued that its failure to do so would further Kremlin misinformation and propaganda efforts. ""I am convinced that our surveys should be done thoroughly, bearing in mind the people whose lives often depend directly on the words and actions of international organizations,"" she said. In a news release that accompanied the report's publication, Amnesty International Secretary-general Agnes Callamard said the organization had ""documented a pattern of Ukrainian forces putting civilians at risk and violating the laws of war when they operate in populated areas. ""Being in a defensive position does not exempt the Ukrainian military from respecting international humanitarian law,"" she said Thursday. Russian state-sponsored media quoted the report to support Moscow´s claim that Russia has only launched strikes on military targets during the war. The spokesperson for Russia's Foreign Ministry cited the Amnesty International assertions as proof that Ukraine was using civilians as human shields. Multiple Western scholars of international and military law went on social media to reject the human shield claim. They said the report contained poor phrasing that muddied legal distinctions and ignored the combat conditions in Ukraine. United Nations war crimes investigator Marc Garlasco, tweeting in a personal capacity Friday, accused Amnesty International of ""getting the law wrong"" and said Ukraine was taking steps to protect civilians, such as helping them relocate. Ukrainian authorities at the national and regional level have repeatedly urged residents of frontline areas to evacuate, although tens of thousands of people who left their homes since Russia´s invasion have returned after running out of support or feeling unwelcome. Ukrainian leaders, including President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and the country´s foreign and defense ministers, have been scathing in their condemnation of the report, which they said failed to provide context on Russia´s bombardments of populated areas and documented attacks on civilians. Callamard, Amnesty's secretary-general, posted a tweet Friday that defended the organization´s work and took aim at its critics. ""Ukrainian and Russian social media mobs and trolls: they are all at it today attacking Amnesty investigations. This is called war propaganda, disinformation, misinformation. This won´t dent our impartiality and won´t change the facts,"" she wrote. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba issued an angry response to Callamard in which he accused her organization of ""fake neutrality"" and playing into the Kremlin´s hands. ""Apparently, Amnesty´s Secretary General calls me a `mob´ and a `troll´, but this won´t stop me from saying that its report distorts reality, draws false moral equivalence between the aggressor and the victim, and boosts Russia´s disinformation effort. This is fake `neutrality´, not truthfulness,"" Kuleba wrote on Twitter. ___ Follow AP's coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine"

As heavy ground fighting continues on the front line only miles to the east, southeast and north of Sloviansk, members of the Dnipro-1 Regiment are digging in after a week of relative calm. The last Russian strike on the city occurred on July 30. While the lull provided Sloviansk's remaining residents a reprieve after regular shellings between April and July, some unit members say it could be a prelude to renewed attacks. ""I think it won´t be calm for long. Eventually, there will be an assault,"" Col. Yurii Bereza, the head of the volunteer national guard regiment, told The Associated Press on Friday, adding that he expected the area to get ""hot"" in the coming days. Sloviansk is considered a strategic target in Moscow´s ambitions to seize all of Donetsk province, a largely Russian-speaking area in eastern Ukraine where Russian forces and pro-Moscow separatists control about 60% of the territory. Donetsk and neighboring Luhansk province, which Russia has almost entirely captured since Ukrainian forces withdrew in early July from the remaining cities under their control, together make up the industrial Donbas region. The separatists have claimed the region as two independent republics since 2014, and Russian President Vladimir Putin recognized their sovereignty before he sent troops into Ukraine. Members of the Dnipro-1 regiment carry logs to fortify their position near Sloviansk, Donetsk region, eastern Ukraine, Friday, Aug. 5, 2022. While the lull in rocket strikes has offered a reprieve to remaining residents, some members of the Ukrainian unit say it could be a prelude to renewed Russian attacks. (AP Photo/David Goldman) Seizing Sloviansk would put more of the region under Russian control, but it also would be a symbolic victory for Moscow. The city was the first to be taken by the separatists during an outbreak of hostilities between Russia and Ukraine in 2014, though it was later brought back under Ukrainian control. Furthermore, Russia´s military would like to take control of nearby water treatment facilities to serve Russian-occupied cities like Donetsk to the southeast and Mariupol to the south, Sgt. Maj. Artur Shevtsov of the Dnipro-1 Regiment said. The Institute for the Study of War, a think tank based in Washington, said in a Friday assessment that Russian forces had increasingly transferred personnel and equipment from the Donbas toward southern Ukraine to push back at a Ukrainian counteroffensive around the occupied port city of Kherson. Those attempts to secure Kherson come ""at the expense of (Russian) efforts to seize Sloviansk ... which they appear to have abandoned,"" the institute's analysts said. But Col. Bereza said he thought muddy conditions after recent rainy weather in the region, not the abandonment of Sloviansk as a target, were responsible for the pause in Russian artillery strikes. ""In two or three days, when it dries out, they will proceed,"" he said. Only around 20,000 residents remain in Sloviansk, down from over 100,000 before Russia´s invasion. The city has been without gas or water for months, and residents are only able to manually pump drinking water from public wells. From a position on the outskirts of the city, soldiers in the Dnipro-1 Regiment expanded a network of trenches and dug bunkers against mortar strikes and phosphorous bombs. At the outpost, Sgt. Maj. Shevtsov said the provision of heavy weapons from Ukraine´s Western allies, including U.S.-supplied multiple rocket launchers, had helped keep some Donbas cities like Sloviansk relatively safe since their delivery in June. But such weapons have likely only bought time for Ukrainian forces, he said, adding that the lack of strikes in the last week ""worries me."" In his experience, a lull means the Russians are preparing to go on the attack. Another officer, Cmdr. Ihor Krylchatenko, said he suspected the silence could be broken within days. ""We were warned that there could be an assault on the 7th or 8th"" of August, he said.

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-11086827/EXPLAINER-Why-Kenyas-presidential-election-important.html,2022-08-06,EXPLAINER: Why Kenya's presidential election is important,"Kenyans are voting Tuesday to choose a successor to President Uhuru Kenyatta after a decade in power. The race is close and could go to a runoff for the first time. One top candidate is Raila Odinga, an opposition leader in his fifth run for the presidency who is supported by his former rival Kenyatta. The other is William Ruto, Kenyatta´s deputy who fell out with the president. Both tend to focus far more on domestic issues, raising the question of how either will follow up on Kenyatta's diplomatic efforts to quell the tensions in neighboring Ethiopia or disputes between Rwanda and Congo. WHAT´S AT STAKE? Kenya is East Africa´s economic hub and home to about 56 million people. The country has a recent history of turbulent elections. Even then, it stands out for its relative stability in a region where some elections are deeply challenged and longtime leaders such as Rwandan President Paul Kagame and Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni have been declared the winner with almost 99% of votes, or been widely accused of physically cracking down on contenders. Kenya has no transparency in campaign donations or spending. Some candidates for Parliament and other posts are estimated to be spending hundreds of thousands of dollars to gain access to power and its benefits, both legal and illegal. Kenyan presidential candidate William Ruto greets supporters at his final electoral campaign rally at Nyayo stadium in Nairobi, Kenya Saturday, Aug. 6, 2022. Kenya is due to hold its general election on Tuesday, Aug. 9 as the East Africa's economic hub chooses a successor to President Uhuru Kenyatta. (AP Photo/Ben Curtis) WHAT ARE THE MAIN CANDIDATES' PLATFORMS? The 55-year-old Ruto promotes himself to the young and poor as a ""hustler"" who rose from humble beginnings as a chicken seller in contrast to the elite backgrounds of Kenyatta and Odinga. He seeks greater agricultural productivity and financial inclusion. Agriculture is a main driver of Kenya´s economy and about 70% of the rural workforce is in farming. In his final campaign speech on Saturday, he said if elected, his government will deploy 200 billion shillings ($1.6 billion) a year to increase job opportunities. The 77-year-old Odinga, famous for being jailed while fighting for multi-party democracy decades ago, has promised cash handouts to Kenya´s poorest and more accessible health care for all. In his final campaign speech on Saturday, he said that if elected, his government in its first 100 days would begin paying 6,000 shillings ($50) to families living below the poverty line. WHAT DO VOTERS CARE ABOUT? Odinga and Ruto have long circled among contenders for the presidency, and there is a measure of apathy among Kenyans, especially younger ones in a country where the median age is about 20. The electoral commission signed up less than half of the new voters it had hoped for, just 2.5 million. Key issues in every election include widespread corruption and the economy. Kenyans have been hurt by rising prices for food and fuel in the wake of Russia´s invasion of Ukraine, and that comes after the financial pain of the COVID-19 pandemic. More than a third of the country´s youth are unemployed. WHEN WILL KENYA HAVE A WINNER? Official results will be announced within a week of the vote. To win outright, a candidate needs more than half of all votes and at least 25% of the votes in more than half of Kenya´s 47 counties. No outright winner means a runoff election within 30 days. The previous presidential election in 2017 made history when a top court overturned the results and ordered a new vote, a first in Africa. If the courts again call for a new vote, such an election would take place within 60 days of the ruling. Candidates or others have a week after the results are declared to file a petition to the court, which has two weeks to rule on it. ""I want you to know that we as a country are at an inflection point,"" Odinga told the crowd listening to his campaign speech Saturday. ""Either something very good will happen or something terrible will happen."" He vowed to shake the hand of his ""rivals"" whether he wins or loses. Ruto said Saturday he will ""respect the decision of the people of Kenya"" and won't accept violence or participate in anything that undermines the constitution.

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-11086809/Lebanon-bound-ship-brings-hope-not-solution-food-crisis.html,2022-08-06,"Ukraine grain shipments offer hope, not fix to food crisis","A ship bringing corn to Lebanon´s northern port of Tripoli normally would not cause a stir. But it's getting attention because of where it came from: Ukraine´s Black Sea port of Odesa. The Razoni, loaded with more than 26,000 tons of corn for chicken feed, is emerging from the edges of a Russian war that has threatened food supplies in countries like Lebanon, which has the world's highest rate of food inflation - a staggering 122% - and depends on the Black Sea region for nearly all of its wheat. The fighting has trapped 20 million tons of grains inside Ukraine, and the Razoni's departure Monday marked a first major step toward extracting those food supplies and getting them to farms and bakeries to feed millions of impoverished people who are going hungry in Africa, the Middle East and parts of Asia. ""Actually seeing the shipment move is a big deal,"" said Jonathan Haines, senior analyst at data and analytics firm Gro Intelligence. ""This 26,000 tons in the scale of the 20 million tons that are locked up is nothing, absolutely nothing ... but if we start seeing this, every shipment that goes is going to increase confidence."" The small scale means the initial shipments leaving the world's breadbasket will not draw down food prices or ease a global food crisis anytime soon. Plus, most of the trapped grain is for animal feed, not for people to eat, experts say. That will extend the war's ripple effects for the world´s most vulnerable people thousands of miles away in countries like Somalia and Afghanistan, where hunger could soon turn to famine and where inflation has pushed the cost of food and energy out of reach for many. To farmers in Lebanon, the shipment expected this weekend is a sign that grains might become more available again, even if at a higher price, said Ibrahim Tarchichi, head of the Bekaa Farmers Association.

Its final destination is Lebanon, with estimated arrival date on Saturday, Aug. 6, 2022. (AP Photo/Khalil Hamra, File) But he said it won´t make a dent in his country, where years of endemic corruption and political divides have upended life. Since 2019, the economy has contracted by at least 58%, with the currency depreciating so severely that nearly three-quarters of the population now lives in poverty. ""I think the crisis will continue as long as operating costs continue to soar and purchasing power falls,"" Tarchichi said. The strife was on sharp display this week when a section of Beirut´s massive port grain silos collapsed in a huge cloud of dust, two years after an explosion killed more than 200 people and wounded thousands more. While symbolic, the shipments have done little to ease market concerns. Drought and high fertilizer costs have kept grain prices more than 50% higher than early 2020, before the COVID-19 pandemic. And while Ukraine is a top supplier of wheat, barley, corn and sunflower oil to developing countries, it represents just 10% of the international wheat trade. There´s also little to suggest that the world´s poorest who rely on Ukrainian wheat distributed through U.N. agencies like the World Food Program will be able to access them anytime soon. Before the war, half of the grain the WFP purchased for distribution came from Ukraine. The Razoni's safe passage was guaranteed by a four-month-long deal that the U.N. and Turkey brokered with Ukraine and Russia two weeks ago. The grain corridor through the Black Sea is 111 nautical miles long and 3 nautical miles wide, with waters strewn with drifting explosive mines, slowing the work. Three more ships departed Friday, heading to Turkey, Ireland and the United Kingdom. All the ships that have departed so far had been stuck there since the war began nearly six months ago. Under the deal, some - not all - of the food exported will go to countries experiencing food insecurity. That means it could take weeks for people in Africa to see grain from the new shipments and even longer to see the effects on high food prices, said Shaun Ferris, a Kenya-based adviser on agriculture and markets for Catholic Relief Services, a partner in World Food Program distributions. In East Africa, thousands of people have died as Somalia and neighboring Ethiopia and Kenya face the worst drought in four decades. Survivors have described burying their children as they fled to camps where little assistance could be found. After Russia invaded Ukraine, Somalia and other African countries turned to non-traditional grain partners like India, Turkey and Brazil, but at higher prices. Prices of critical foods could start to go down in two or three months as markets for imported food adjust and local harvests progress, Ferris said. Who is first in line for the grain from Ukraine could be affected by humanitarian needs but also comes down to existing business arrangements and commercial interests, including who is willing to pay the most, Ferris said. ""Ukraine is not a charity,"" he said. ""It will be looking to get the best deals on the market"" to maintain its own fragile economy. The WFP said this week that it´s planning to buy, load and ship 30,000 tons of wheat out of Ukraine on a U.N.-chartered vessel. It did not say where the vessel would go or when that voyage might happen. In Lebanon, where humanitarian aid group Mercy Corps says the price of wheat flour has risen by more than 200% since the start of Russia´s war, people stood in long, often tense lines outside bakeries for subsidized bread in recent days. The government green-lit a $150 million World Bank loan to import wheat, a temporary solution of six to nine months before it could be forced to lift subsidies on bread altogether. While the situation is hard for millions of Lebanese, the country´s roughly 1 million Syrian refugees who fled a civil war across the border face stigmatization and discrimination trying to buy bread. A Syrian living in northern Lebanon said it often takes him three to four visits to bakeries before he finds someone willing to sell him bread, with priority given to Lebanese. He described lines of 100 people waiting and only a handful being allowed in every half-hour to buy a small bundle of loaves. ""We get all sorts of rude comments because we´re Syrian, which we usually just ignore, but sometimes it gets too much and we decide to go home empty-handed,"" he said, speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal. ___ Batrawy reported from Dubai, United Arab Emirates, and Anna from Nairobi, Kenya. ___ Follow AP's coverage of the Russia-Ukraine war at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine FILE - Bakery workers package freshly-produced bread coming off a production line at an automated bakery in the southern Beirut suburb of Dahiyeh, Lebanon, Tuesday, March 15, 2022.

""Nuclear weapons are nonsense. They guarantee no safety - only death and destruction,"" said U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres, who joined the prayer at the Hiroshima Peace Park. ""Three quarters of a century later, we must ask what we´ve learned from the mushroom cloud that swelled above this city in 1945,"" he said. The United States dropped the world´s first atomic bomb on Hiroshima on Aug. 6, 1945, destroying the city and killing 140,000 people. It dropped a second bomb three days later on Nagasaki, killing another 70,000. Japan surrendered on Aug. 15, ending World War II and Japan´s nearly half-century of aggression in Asia. Fears of a third atomic bombing have grown amid Russia´s threats of nuclear attack since its war on Ukraine began in February. ""Crises with grave nuclear undertones are spreading fast"" in the Middle East and the Korean Peninsula, Guterres said. ""We are one mistake, one misunderstanding, one miscalculation away from Armageddon."" Doves fly over the cenotaph dedicated to the victims of the atomic bombing during the ceremony marking the 77th anniversary of the world's first atomic bombing, at the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park in Hiroshima, western Japan Saturday, Aug. 6, 2022. (Kyodo News via AP) Hiroshima Mayor Kazumi Matsui, in his peace declaration, accused Putin of ""using his own people as instruments of war and stealing the lives and livelihoods of innocent civilians in another country."" Russia´s war on Ukraine is helping build support for nuclear deterrence, Matsui said, urging the world not to repeat the mistakes that destroyed his city nearly eight decades ago. On Saturday, attendees including government leaders and diplomats observed a moment of silence with the sound of a peace bell at 8:15 a.m., the time when the U.S. B-29 dropped the bomb on the city. About 400 doves, considered symbols of peace, were released. Guterres met with Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida after the ceremony and raised alarm over the global retreat in nuclear disarmament, stressing the importance for Japan, the world's only nation to have suffered nuclear attacks, to take leadership in the effort, Japan's Foreign Ministry said. Kishida escorted Guterres in the peace museum, where they each folded an origami crane - a symbol of peace and nuclear weapons abolition. Russia and its ally Belarus were not invited to this year's peace memorial. Russian Ambassador to Japan Mikhail Galuzin on Thursday offered flowers at a memorial epitaph in the park and told reporters his country would never use nuclear weapons. The world continues to face threats from nuclear weapons, Kishida said at the memorial. ""I must raise my voice to appeal to the people around the world that the tragedy of nuclear weapons use should never be repeated,"" he said. ""Japan will walk its path toward a world without nuclear weapons, no matter how narrow, steep or difficult that may be."" Kishida, who will host a Group of Seven summit meeting next May in Hiroshima, said he hoped to share his pledge with other G7 leaders ""before the peace monument"" to unite them to protect peace and international order based on the universal values of freedom and democracy. Matsui criticized nuclear weapon states, including Russia, for not taking steps despite their pledge to abide by obligations under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. ""Rather than treating a world without nuclear weapons like a distant dream, they should be taking concrete steps toward its realization,"" he said. Critics say Kishida's call for a nuclear-free world is hollow because Japan remains under the U.S. nuclear umbrella and continues to boycott the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons. Kishida said the treaty, which lacks the U.S. and other nuclear powers, is not realistic at the moment and that Japan needs to bridge the divide between non-nuclear and nuclear powers. Many survivors of the bombings have lasting injuries and illnesses resulting from the explosions and radiation exposure and face discrimination in Japan. The government began to provide medical support to certified survivors in 1968 after more than 20 years of effort by them. As of March, 118,935 survivors, whose average age now exceeds 84, are certified as eligible for government medical support, according to the Health and Welfare Ministry. But many others, including those who say they were victims of the ""black rain"" that fell outside of the initially designated areas, are still without support. Aging survivors, known in Japan as hibakusha, continue to push for a nuclear ban and hope to convince younger generations to join the movement. Guterres had a message for younger people: ""Finish the work that the hibakusha have begun. Carry their message forward. In their names, in their honor, in their memory - we must act.""

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-11086485/UN-experts-Malian-military-white-soldiers-killed-33.html,2022-08-06,UN experts: Malian military and 'white' soldiers killed 33,"U.N. experts said in a new report that Malian armed forces allegedly carried out an operation with ""white-skinned soldiers"" near the border with Mauritania in March, shooting and burning at least 33 civilians in one of several operations where the country´s ruling military appeared to work closely with likely Russian mercenaries. In the first three months of this year, they said 543 civilians were killed and 269 injured, according to the U.N. peacekeeping mission in Mali. In the grim and wide-ranging report obtained Friday by The Associated Press, the panel of experts said the political situation remains tense and warned that the 2015 peace agreement between Mali´s government and non-extremist armed independence groups ""is threatened by a potential risk of confrontation between the parties for the first time since July 2017."" They said 12 million people need humanitarian assistance, a sharp increase from 5.9 million last year, including 1.9 million people facing the threat of ""acute malnutrition"" during the current lean season which lasts through August. Mali has struggled to contain an Islamic extremist insurgency since 2012. Extremist rebels were forced from power in Mali´s northern cities with the help of a French-led military operation, but they regrouped in the desert and began launching attacks on the Malian army and its allies. Insecurity has worsened with attacks on civilians and U.N. peacekeepers. In August 2020, Malian President Boubacar Ibrahim Keita, who died in January, was overthrown in a coup that included Assimi Goita, then an army colonel. Last June, Goita was sworn in as president of a transitional government after carrying out his second coup in nine months and later in the year it reportedly decided to allow the deployment of Russia´s Wagner group. Wagner passes itself off as a private military contractor but its long believed commitment to Russian interests have become apparent in Ukraine, where its mercenaries are among the Russian forces currently fighting in the country´s separatist eastern regions. In sub-Saharan Africa, Wagner has gained substantial footholds for Russia in Central African Republic and Sudan as well as Mali, where analysts said its role goes beyond merely providing security services. The 78-page report by the U.N. experts doesn´t name Wagner in connection with any incidents, but it describes several operations where Malian forces were joined by white soldiers, including one on March 5 in the town of Robinet El Ataye in the Segou region near the border with Mauritania. According to testimony the experts said, a group of ""white-skinned soldiers"" arrived in the town, which has a water well frequented by Mauritanians who cross the border in search of pasture for cattle, rounded up men and boys, tied their hands behind their backs and blindfolded them. Women and children were told to go home and the soldiers that reportedly stripped houses of ""all possessions including bedding, cellular phones, jewelry, cooking utensils and clothing,"" they said. Later in the morning, the panel said, Malian soldiers arrived in the village started beating the bound and blindfolded men ""with heavy sticks used by the herders on their flocks."" The women heard screams but were blocked by soldiers from leaving their homes, and the Malian forces then released some younger men and carried off at least 33 men, 29 Mauritanians and four Malians who were ethnic Tuaregs, it said. The women waited for the return of the men, but the panel said they were notified by relatives a day later that the men´s bodies had been found about 4 kilometers away, and they ""had been shot and then burnt,"" the experts said. The panel said ""a similar pattern of pillage and beatings"" occurred at five other locations, but the only place civilians were killed was at Robinet El Ataye. ""In two other locations visited by the Malian Armed Forces, a helicopter carrying `white-skinned soldiers´ allegedly landed at the beginning of the operations"" it said. On the political front, the experts said the 2015 peace agreement is stalled, none of the political and institutional reforms in the agreement have been finalized, a high-level decision-making meeting on disarmament, demobilization and reintegration quotas for combatants initially planned for Feb. 9, 2021 has yet to take place, and there is ""a perceptible lack of trust between the government and the signatory armed groups."""

The audience was the first between Francis and the new director of the Moscow Patriarchate´s foreign relations office, Metropolitan Anthony. He replaced the Vatican´s longtime liaison with the Russian Orthodox Church, Metropolitan Hilarion, who was transferred to Hungary after Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24. Both the pope and Kirill have confirmed their presence in Kazakhstan to attend a government-organized interfaith meeting, the ""Congress of Leaders of World and Traditional Religions,"" from Sept. 14-15. If they meet on the sidelines of the congress, it would be the second-ever encounter between a pope and a Russian patriarch, after a June encounter was canceled because of the diplomatic fallout over Russia´s invasion. Kirill has justified the invasion of Ukraine on spiritual and ideological grounds, calling it a ""metaphysical"" battle with the West. He has blessed Russian soldiers going into battle and invoked the idea that Russians and Ukrainians are one people. Francis´ audience with Kirill´s envoy came on the same day the pope made a symbolically meaningful decision for some Ukrainian Catholics: He declared an underground Ruthenian Greek Catholic priest who ministered during Soviet times in Ukraine, the Rev. Petros Oros, a martyr, fast-tracking him on the path to possible sainthood. Oros lived from 1917 until 1953, when he was killed out of hatred of the faith by Soviet forces, the Vatican said in a statement. The Holy See´s in-house media arm, Vatican News, said Oros had been shot in the chin a few hours after celebrating a clandestine Divine Liturgy in Siltse. At the time, Catholics had been persecuted and Oros' eparchy suppressed, and the Vatican noted that Oros had been pressured to transfer to the Russian Orthodox Church but ""resisted, remaining faithful to the pope."" Under the Vatican's rules for martyrs, Oros can now be beatified - the first step toward possible sainthood - without having to have a miracle attributed to his intercession. A miracle is needed for canonization."

Speaking at the start of the meeting at Putin´s Black Sea residence in Sochi, Erdogan said their negotiations would help ""put forward the role that Turkey and Russia play in the region."" He cast the talks as pivotal, saying they were being watched closely by the rest of the world. ""Today, of, course, the world´s eye is on Sochi,"" Erdogan said. ""They are following it, wondering what is being discussed and done in Sochi."" Last month, Turkey and the United Nations helped broker agreements between Russia and Ukraine to clear the way for Ukraine to export 22 million tons of agricultural products stuck in its Black Sea ports since Moscow sent troops into the country more than five months ago. The deals also allow Russia to export grain and fertilizer. Three more ships carrying thousands of tons of corn left Ukrainian ports Friday. The first vessel to depart under the terms of the deal left Ukraine earlier in the week. Putin thanked Erdogan for helping to negotiate the grain deal, which is overseen from Istanbul by officials from Ukraine, Russia, Turkey and the U.N. Cargo vessels are accompanied by Ukrainian pilot ships for safe passage because of explosive mines strewn in the Black Sea. In this handout photo provided by the Turkish Presidency, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, left, and Russian President Vladimir Putin shake hands prior to their meeting at the Rus sanatorium in the Black Sea resort of Sochi, Russia, Friday, Aug. 5, 2022.( Turkish Presidency via AP ) The Russian leader noted the agreement's importance for many countries around the world that depend on Russian and Ukrainian exports to feed their people and to grow their own crops. ""It´s an acute issue for many developing countries, which face major problems with food and fertilizers,"" he said. In a statement issued after the talks that lasted four hours, Putin and Erdogan emphasized ""the necessity of a complete fulfillment of the package deal reached in Istanbul ... including unhindered export of Russian grain and fertilizers."" They also noted the ""key importance of sincere, frank and trusting ties between Russia and Turkey for regional and global stability."" In March, Turkey hosted a round of talks between Russian and Ukrainian negotiators, who discussed a possible deal to end the hostilities. The talks fell apart after the meeting in Istanbul, with Russia and Ukraine blaming each other for the lack of progress. When Putin and Erdogan met in Tehran last month on the sidelines of a trilateral summit with Iran, the Turkish leader made the Russian president wait for nearly a minute before entering the room. Some observers interpreted the action as a reflection of Erdogan´s newly assertive stand in relations with Moscow, which has faced increasing pressure from the West. There was no sign of such posturing during Friday´s talks, which saw the two presidents hailing their ties and vowing to develop them further. Erdogan´s visit to Sochi underlined the importance of close ties with Russia for Turkey. NATO-member Turkey and Russia have a complex relationship. While the two countries support opposing sides in Syria and Libya, they cooperate closely on defense, energy and trade deals. Their relationship has frustrated Turkey´s Western allies, who were particularly annoyed by Ankara´s purchase of a sophisticated Russian air defense system. Turkey has provided Ukraine with drones, which played a significant role in deterring a Russian advance during the early stage of the conflict, but it hasn´t joined in imposing sanctions on Russia. Putin hailed the energy cooperation between Russia and Turkey, noting the importance of the TurkStream pipeline that delivers Russian gas to Turkey and southern Europe via the Black Sea. ""European partners should be grateful to Turkey for ensuring uninterrupted transit of our gas to European markets,"" Putin said. He noted that the Russian-Turkish trade doubled in the first five months of the year compared to the same period last year, a surge reflecting Moscow´s growing focus on ties with Ankara as it faced bruising Western sanctions. Amid a major economic crisis with official inflation hitting nearly 80%, Turkey also increasingly relies on Russia for trade and tourism. Russian gas covers 45% of Turkish energy needs, and Russia´s atomic agency is building Turkey´s first nuclear power plant. Erdogan emphasized the importance of the nuclear plant project, expressing hope that it will face no delays and noting that the nuclear power plant would supply 10% of the country´s energy needs. Speaking to reporters after the talks, Russia´s Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak said the leaders reaffirmed that the nuclear plant should be launched as scheduled next year. He added that they also agreed that Turkey will start partly paying in rubles for Russian gas supplies. Moscow has previously switched to rubles in its trade with EU customers to avoid Western sanctions that blocked most payments in euros and froze Russian hard currency reserves abroad. Novak also said ""big"" agreements were reached in the financial sphere to facilitate payments by Russian companies and citizens. ""Very important decisions that were reached during today´s talks will take our economic and trade ties to a new level in practically all areas,"" he told reporters. Russia-Turkey relations hit a low point in 2015 when Turkey shot down a Russian warplane near the Syrian border and Moscow responded by halting tourism to Turkey and banning imports of fruit and vegetables and other items from Turkey. While Moscow and Ankara have backed the opposite sides in the Syrian conflict, with Russia shoring up President Bashar Assad´s government with Iranian assistance while Turkey supported the opposition, the two countries cooperated closely to negotiate a cease-fire deal in northwestern Syria. Turkey would like Moscow to green-light a Turkish operation into northern Syria against Kurdish militants whom Turkey considers terrorists. Speaking to Putin Friday, Erdogan voiced hope that their discussion on Syria would ""bring relief to the region."" In a statement after the talks, the two leaders underlined the need for ""close cooperation and coordination in the fight against all terrorist organizations."" __ Bilginsoy reported from Istanbul.

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-11084445/Kremlin-says-Griner-swap-discussed-without-publicity.html,2022-08-05,Kremlin says Griner swap must be discussed without publicity,"The Kremlin said Friday that it's open to talking about a possible prisoner exchange involving American basketball star Brittney Griner but strongly warned Washington against publicizing the issue. Griner, a two-time U.S. Olympic champion and an eight-time all-star with the WNBA´s Phoenix Mercury, has been detained in Russia since Feb. 17 after police at a Moscow airport said they found vape cartridges containing cannabis oil in her luggage. A judge convicted the 31-year-old athlete Thursday of drug possession and smuggling, and sentenced her to nine years in prison. The politically charged case comes amid high tensions between Moscow and Washington over Russia´s military action in Ukraine. Asked at the White House Friday about the prospects of securing Griner´s release, President Joe Biden said: ""I´m hopeful ... We´re working hard."" In an extraordinary move, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken spoke last week to Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, urging him to accept a deal under which Griner and Paul Whelan, an American jailed in Russia on espionage charges, would go free. Lavrov and Blinken were both in Cambodia on Friday for a meeting of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. Blinken did not even glance at his Russian counterpart as they took their seats at an East Asia Summit.

(AP Photo/Alexander Zemlianichenko) Lavrov told reporters that Blinken didn´t try to contact him while they were attending the ASEAN meeting. ""We were separated by just one person at the discussion table, but I didn´t feel his desire to catch me. My buttons are all in place,"" he said when asked about Washington´s statement that Blinken would try to buttonhole Lavrov for a quick interaction in Phnom Penh. Lavrov said Moscow was ""ready to discuss"" a prisoner swap but that the topic should only be discussed via a dedicated Russia-U.S. channel that Biden and Russian President Vladimir Putin agreed to establish when they met in Geneva in June 2021. ""If the Americans again try to engage in public diplomacy and make loud statements about their intention to take certain steps, it´s their business, I would even say their problem,"" Lavrov said. ""The Americans often have trouble observing agreements on calm and professional work."" In Moscow, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov made the same point more harshly, saying ""the U.S. already has made mistakes, trying to solve such problems via `microphone diplomacy.´ They are not solved that way."" He, too, emphasized that any discussions on a possible trade should be held via the previously established confidential channels that Putin and Biden agree to during last year's summit. ""Such mechanisms exist, but they will be thrown into doubt if the discussion continues in the public domain,"" Peskov said. He said: ""If we discuss any nuances related to the issue of exchange via media, no exchange will ever take place."" People familiar with the U.S. proposal have said it envisions trading Griner and Whelan for a notorious Russian arms trader, Viktor Bout. He is serving a 25-year sentence in the U.S. after being convicted of conspiracy to kill U.S. citizens and providing aid to a terrorist organization. The call between Blinken and Lavrov marked the highest-level known contact between Washington and Moscow since Russia sent troops into Ukraine more than five months ago, underlining the public pressure that the White House has faced to get Griner released. Griner was arrested as she was returning to play for a team in Russia, where she has competed since 2014. Blinken said Friday that her conviction and sentence ""compounds the injustice that has been done to her."" ""It puts a spotlight on our very significant concern with Russia´s legal system and the Russian government´s use of wrongful detentions to advance its own agenda using individuals as political pawns,"" he said. On Thursday, Biden denounced the Russian judge's verdict and sentence as ""unacceptable"" and said he would continue working to bring Griner and Whelan home. ___ David Rising in Phnom Penh, Cambodia contributed to this report. ___ Follow AP´s coverage of the Brittney Griner case at https://apnews.com/hub/brittney-griner WNBA star and two-time Olympic gold medalist Brittney Griner looks through bars as she listens to the verdict standing in a cage in a courtroom in Khimki just outside Moscow, Russia, Thursday, Aug. 4, 2022.

A report on Pacific Rim economies by the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum said Friday that growth in the region will likely fall by more than half this year to 2.5% from 5.9% last year, when many countries were recovering from the worst of their COVID-19 outbreaks. Weaker growth in the U.S. and China is a big factor behind the regional malaise, though other economies are also slowing. Russia's economy is expected to contract due to the implications of its war in Ukraine, and the three economies account for nearly 70% of the APEC region's GDP, the report said. The report forecast that regional growth would only pick up slightly in 2023, to 2.6%. Most economies in the region are just beginning to fully emerge from border closures and other pandemic-related precautions. Tourists have reappeared on the streets of Bangkok, but many businesses remain shuttered, casualties of the many months when travel was virtually paralyzed. In China, where authorities are still imposing lockdowns to wipe out COVID-19 outbreaks, the economy contracted 2.6% in the three months ending in June compared with the previous quarter after Shanghai and other cities were shut down to fight coronavirus outbreaks.

(AP Photo/Vincent Thian, File) The U.S. economy contracted by 0.9% in April-June, while Russia's economy shrank 0.5% in January-June compared with a year before, according to its Ministry of Economic Development. Japan's economy shrank at a 0.5% annual rate i n January-March and is forecast to expand only 2% in the fiscal year ending in March 2023. Some economies are doing better. Indonesia reported Friday that its economy grew at a better-than-expected 5.4% annual rate in the April-June quarter as it bounced back from a wave of omicron variant coronavirus infections. An exporter of raw materials such as coal and palm oil, the country saw its exports jump nearly 20% in the last quarter as prices for many materials soared. But that windfall is likely to dissipate as price increases ease or reverse, analysts said. ""We expect slowing growth in the rest of the world to take its toll ... as commodity prices continue to recede. On the domestic front, headwinds from high inflation, which reached a seven-year high and is set to rise further in the coming months, are growing,"" Alex Holmes of Oxford Economics said in a commentary. India is also growing faster than much of the rest of the region. Reserve Bank of India Governor Shaktikanta Das projected that growth would remain robust, at 7.2% in the financial year ending in March 2023. But to counter inflation that hit 6.7% in June, the central bank raised its key interest rate on Friday by a half percentage point to 5.4%. More than half of the 21 APEC members have raised rates or otherwise tightened monetary policy to counter inflation, which now averages 5.4% for the region, the APEC report said. It pointed to a 23% overall increase in the food price index of the U.N. Food and Agricultural Organization, noting that inflation is likely to remain elevated for at least the rest of the year as central banks adjust their policies to try to bring it under control.

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-11084231/EXPLAINER-How-know-recession-begun.html,2022-08-05,EXPLAINER: How do we know when a recession has begun?,"The government on Thursday updated its estimate of the U.S. economy's performance in the April-June quarter and confirmed what it had reported last month: That the economy shrank for two straight quarters. Six months of contraction is a long-held informal definition of a recession. Yet nothing is simple in the post-pandemic economy. Growth may be negative, but the job market is strong. The economy's direction has confounded Federal Reserve policymakers and many private economists since growth screeched to a halt in March 2020 as COVID-19 struck and 20 million Americans were suddenly thrown out of work. Even as the economy shrank over the first half of this year, employers added 2.7 million jobs - more than in most entire years before the pandemic struck. In July, the economy added over a half-million more jobs. The unemployment rate sank to 3.5%, a half-century low. Robust hiring and exceedingly low unemployment aren´t consistent with a recession. While most economists - and Fed Chair Jerome Powell - have said they don´t think the economy is in recession, some analysts still predict that an economic downturn will begin later this year or next. Either way, inflation remains near its highest level in four decades, though gas costs and other prices have eased in recent weeks. Inflation is still so high that despite pay raises many have received, Americans´ purchasing power is eroding. The pain is being felt disproportionately by lower-income and Black and Hispanic households, many of whom are struggling to pay for higher-cost essentials like food, gas and rent. Compounding those pressures, the Fed is jacking up interest rates at the fastest pace since the early 1980s, thereby magnifying borrowing costs for homes and cars and credit card purchases. As a result, regardless of whether a recession has officially begun, Americans have soured on the economy. FILE - A hiring sign is placed at a booth for prospective employers during a job fair Wednesday, Sept. 22, 2021, in the West Hollywood section of Los Angeles. The California Employment Development Department said Friday, Aug. 19, 2022, that the state's unemployment rate was 3.9% in July. That's the lowest since 1976 when the state began using its current method of measuring job growth(AP Photo/Marcio Jose Sanchez, File) So how, exactly, do we know when an economy is in recession? Here are some answers to such questions: ____ WHO DECIDES WHEN A RECESSION HAS STARTED? Recessions are officially declared by the obscure-sounding National Bureau of Economic Research, a group of economists whose Business Cycle Dating Committee defines a recession as ""a significant decline in economic activity that is spread across the economy and lasts more than a few months."" The committee considers trends in hiring as a key measure in determining recessions. It also assesses many other data points, including gauges of income, employment, inflation-adjusted spending, retail sales and factory output. It puts heavy weight on jobs and a gauge of inflation-adjusted income that excludes government support payments like Social Security. Yet the NBER typically doesn´t declare a recession until well after one has begun, sometimes for up to a year. Economists consider a half-point rise in the unemployment rate, averaged over several months, as the most historically reliable sign of a downturn. ___ DO TWO STRAIGHT QUARTERS OF ECONOMIC CONTRACTION EQUAL A RECESSION? That´s a common rule of thumb, but it isn´t an official definition. Still, in the past, it has been a useful measure. Michael Strain, an economist at the right-leaning American Enterprise Institute, has noted that in each of the past 10 times that the economy shrank for two consecutive quarters, a recession has resulted. Still, many economists doubt that we´re in a recession now. For one thing, there's the robust job market. For another, Americans are still spending, if more tepidly. Though purchases of goods like appliances and furniture have dropped, spending on services, like airline trips and dinners out, keeps rising, indicating that millions of consumers are venturing out more. ___ DON´T A LOT OF PEOPLE THINK A RECESSION IS COMING? Yes, because many people now feel more financially burdened. With wage gains trailing inflation for most people, higher prices for such essentials as gas, food and rent have eroded Americans´ spending power. Walmart has reported that higher gas and food costs have forced its shoppers to reduce their purchases of discretionary spending such as new clothing, a clear sign that consumer spending, the leading driver of the economy, is weakening. The nation´s largest retailer, Walmart has reduced its profit outlook and said it would have to discount more items like furniture and electronics. And the Fed´s rate hikes have helped send the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate up to to 5.13%, compared with 2.86% a year ago, making homebuying increasingly unaffordable. Higher rates will likely weigh on businesses´ willingness to invest in new buildings, machinery and other equipment. If companies reduce spending and investment, they´ll also start to slow hiring. Rising caution among companies about spending freely could lead eventually to layoffs. If the economy were to lose jobs and the public were to grow more fearful, consumers would further reduce spending. The Fed´s rapid rate hikes have raised the likelihood of recession in the next two years to nearly 50%, Goldman Sachs economists have said. And Bank of America economists now forecast a ""mild"" recession later this year, while Deutsche Bank expects a recession early next year. ___ WHAT ARE SOME SIGNS OF AN IMPENDING RECESSION? The clearest signal that a recession is under way, economists say, would be a steady rise in job losses and a surge in unemployment. In the past, an increase in the unemployment rate of three-tenths of a percentage point, on average over the previous three months, has meant that a recession will soon follow. Many economists monitor the number of people who seek unemployment benefits each week, which indicates whether layoffs are worsening. Weekly applications for jobless aid, averaged over the past four weeks, are just below 250,000, the highest level since last November. Though that is a potentially concerning sign, it is still a low level historically. ___ ANY OTHER SIGNALS TO WATCH FOR? Many economists also monitor changes in the interest payments, or yields, on different bonds for a recession signal known as an ""inverted yield curve."" This occurs when the yield on the 10-year Treasury falls below the yield on a short-term Treasury, such as the 3-month T-bill. That is unusual. Normally, longer-term bonds pay investors a richer yield in exchange for tying up their money for a longer period. Inverted yield curves generally mean that investors foresee a recession that will compel the Fed to slash rates. Inverted curves often predate recessions. Still, it can take 18 to 24 months for a downturn to arrive after the yield curve inverts. For the past several weeks, the yield on the two-year Treasury has exceeded the 10-year yield, suggesting that markets expect a recession soon. Many analysts say, though, that comparing the 3-month yield to the 10-year has a better recession-forecasting track record. Those rates are not inverted now. ___ WILL THE FED KEEP RAISING RATES EVEN AS THE ECONOMY SLOWS? The economy´s flashing signals - slowing growth with strong hiring - have put the Fed in a tough spot. Chair Jerome Powell is aiming for a ""soft landing,"" in which the economy weakens enough to slow hiring and wage growth without causing a recession and brings inflation back to the Fed´s 2% target. But Powell has acknowledged that such an outcome has grown more difficult to achieve. Russia´s invasion of Ukraine and China´s COVID-19 lockdowns have driven up prices for energy food, and many manufactured parts in the U.S. Powell has also indicated that if necessary, the Fed will keep raising rates even amid a weak economy if that´s what´s needed to tame inflation. ""Is there a risk that we would go too far?"" Powell said recently. ""Certainly there´s a risk, but I wouldn´t agree that´s the biggest risk to the economy. The biggest mistake to make...would be to fail to restore price stability."""
https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-11083719/Three-ships-grain-depart-Ukrainian-ports.html,2022-08-05,3 more ships with grain depart Ukraine ports under UN deal,"Three more ships carrying thousands of tons of corn left Ukrainian ports Friday and traveled mined waters toward inspection of their delayed cargo, a sign that an international deal to export grain held up since Russia invaded Ukraine was slowly progressing. But major hurdles lie ahead to get food to the countries that need it most. The ships bound for Ireland, the United Kingdom and Turkey follow the first grain shipment to pass through the Black Sea since the start of the war. The passage of that vessel heading for Lebanon earlier this week was the first under the breakthrough deal brokered by Turkey and the United Nations with Russia and Ukraine. The first vessels to leave are among more than a dozen bulk carriers and cargo ships loaded months ago but stuck in ports since Russia invaded in late February. While the resumed shipments have raised hopes of easing a global food crisis, much of the backed-up cargo is for animal feed, not for people to eat, experts say. The Black Sea region is dubbed the world´s breadbasket, with Ukraine and Russia key global suppliers of wheat, corn, barley and sunflower oil that millions of impoverished people in Africa, the Middle East and parts of Asia rely on for survival. However, the initial shipments are not expected to have a significant impact on the global price of corn, wheat and soybeans. For starters, the exports under the deal are off to a slow, cautious start due to the threat of explosive mines floating off Ukraine´s Black Sea coastline. And while Ukraine is a major exporter of wheat to developing nations, there are other countries, such as the United States and Canada, with far greater production levels that can affect global wheat prices. And they face the threat of drought. The ship Navi-Star carrying a load of corn starts its way from the port in Odesa, Ukraine, Friday, Aug. 5, 2022. Ukraine is a major global grain supplier but the war had blocked most exports, so the July 22 deal aimed to ease food security around the globe. World food prices have been soaring in a crisis blamed on the war, supply chain problems and COVID-19. (AP Photo/Nina Lyashonok) ""Ukraine is about 10% of the international trade in wheat, but in terms of production it is not even 5%,"" said David Laborde, an expert on agriculture and trade at the International Food Policy Research Institute in Washington. The three ships departing Friday were accompanied by Ukrainian pilot ships for safe passage because of explosive mines strewn in the Black Sea. The vessels set out with over 58,000 tons of corn, but that is still a fraction of the 20 million tons of grains that Ukraine says are trapped in the country´s silos and ports and that must be shipped out to make space for this year's harvest. Around 6 million tons of the trapped grain is wheat, but just half of that is for human consumption, Laborde said. There is an expectation that Ukraine could produce 30% to 40% less grain over the next 12 months due to the war, though other estimates put that figure at 70%. Grain prices peaked after Russia´s invasion, and while some have since come down to their pre-war levels, they are still higher than before the COVID-19 pandemic. Corn prices are 70% higher than at the end of February 2020, said Jonathan Haines, senior analyst at data and analytics firm Gro Intelligence. He said wheat prices are around 60% higher than in February 2020. One reason prices remain high is the impact of drought on harvests in North America, China and other regions, as well as the higher price of fertilizer needed for farming. ""When fertilizer prices are high, farmers may use less fertilizer. And when they use less fertilizer, they will produce less. And if they will produce less, supply will continue to remain insufficient,"" Laborde said. The three ships that departed Ukraine on Friday give hope that exports will ramp up to developing nations, where many are facing the increased threat of food shortages and hunger. ""The movement of three additional vessels overnight is a very positive sign and will continue to build confidence that we´re moving in the right direction,"" Haines said. ""If the flow of grain from Ukraine continues to expand, it will help relieve global supply constraints."" The Turkish-flagged Polarnet, carrying 12,000 tons of corn, left the Chornomorsk port destined for Karasu, Turkey. The Panama-flagged Navi Star left Odesa's port for Ireland with 33,000 tons of corn. The Maltese-flagged Rojen left Chornomorsk for the United Kingdom carrying over 13,000 tons of corn, the U.N. said. It added that the Joint Coordination Center - run by officials from Ukraine, Russia, Turkey and the U.N. overseeing the deal signed in Istanbul last month - authorized the three ships and inspected a ship headed for Ukraine. The Barbados-flagged Fulmar S was inspected in Istanbul and is headed for the Chornomorsk port. The checks seek to ensure that outbound cargo ships carry only grain, fertilizer or food and not any other commodities and that inbound ships are not carrying weapons. After Turkey helped broker the food deal two weeks ago, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan met with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Sochi, Russia, on Friday. In a statement after the talks that lasted four hours, Putin and Erdogan emphasized ""the necessity of a complete fulfillment of the package deal reached in Istanbul ... including unhindered export of Russian grain and fertilizers."" In other developments Friday, Ukraine´s presidential office said at least eight civilians were killed and 16 others wounded in the latest Russian shelling. The eastern Donetsk region has for weeks faced the most intensive Russian barrage. Donetsk Gov. Pavlo Kyrylenko repeated his call for all residents to evacuate. ""Shellings and bombings are going round the clock, and people who refuse to evacuate risk being killed on their pillows,"" Kyrylenko said in televised remarks. In Ukraine´s second-largest city of Kharkiv, three districts have come under massive shelling. Several apartment buildings and a street market were damaged, and three people were wounded. Russian shelling also targeted the city of Zaporizhzhia and several towns along the front-line in the region. For a second straight day, the Russians also shelled the city of Nikopol that faces the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant across the Dnieper River. Dozens of houses were damaged. Energoatom, which operates Ukraine´s nuclear power plants, said three shells landed in the evening on the territory of the Zaporizhzhia plant, which is Europe´s largest. No casualties or damage to the reactors was reported. ""This is an open and audacious crime, an act of terror,"" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in his nightly video address. The Russians also hit the southern city of Mykolaiv. The regional governor, Vitaliy Kim, said Russian forces fired on the city after lunchtime, causing extensive damage, killing an unspecified number of people and injuring at least nine. He said the fire came from the direction of Kherson, the Russian-occupied city about 50 kilometers (30 miles) to the southeast. ___ Batrawy reported from Dubai.

Myanmar´s military-led government, which seized power from elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi in February 2021, has been accused of thousands of extrajudicial killings, and last week carried out its first official executions in decades, raising an outcry from several members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and countries around the world. ASEAN has been trying to implement a five-point consensus it reached on Myanmar last year, calling for dialogue among all concerned parties, provision of humanitarian assistance and an immediate cessation of violence, among other things. Following news of the late-July executions, Malaysian Foreign Minister Saifuddin Abdullah accused Myanmar of ""making a mockery of the five-point process."" Still, in their joint statement Friday, the foreign ministers only ""expressed our concerns over the prolonged political crisis in the country, including the execution of four opposition activists,"" while adding they were ""deeply disappointed by the limited progress"" in the implementation of the five-point consensus. Myanmar's foreign ministry issued a statement later Friday saying it objected to a reference in the ASEAN joint statement to a ""lack of progress"" in implementing the five-point consensus because ""it neglects Myanmar´s efforts on its implementation."" FILE - Members of the Myanmar military march during a parade to commemorate Myanmar's 77th Armed Forces Day in Naypyitaw, Myanmar, Sunday, March 27, 2022. The Association of Southeast Asian Nations foreign ministers issued their final communique Friday, Aug. 5, 2022, after a series of meetings in the Cambodian capital, criticizing fellow member Myanmar for its lack of progress in ending the violence there, but with weaker language than several countries had hoped for. (AP Photo/Aung Shine Oo, File) The ministry's statement, released to journalists in Myanmar, decried efforts by some ASEAN and Western nations to contact opposition forces in Myanmar known as the National Unity Government and its affiliated armed wing, the People Defense Force, which it branded ""terrorists."" ""If ASEAN member states and external partners genuinely wish to help Myanmar in restoring normalcy, they should not encourage engaging with the terrorist groups such as NUG and PDF and should avoid any actions that could encourage terrorism,"" it said. The statement said Myanmar will continue to cooperate in implementing ASEAN's five-point consensus through a ""Myanmar-owned and Myanmar-led process without compromising its national sovereignty."" Cambodia currently holds the rotating chairmanship of ASEAN, which also includes the Philippines, Malaysia, Indonesia, Laos, Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam and Brunei in addition to Myanmar. With the ongoing violence in Myanmar, the country was asked not to send any political representative to the ASEAN meetings. In protest, Myanmar´s military government said it would send no delegate at all, so was unrepresented in the talks. But in preliminary discussions leading up to the main meetings, a lower-level representative from Myanmar expressed objections to the proposed wording of the joint statement, which led to the exclusion of stronger criticism being proposed by Malaysia, Singapore and others, according to a diplomat who was involved in the talks who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the private meetings. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who has in the past urged ASEAN to do more to confront Myanmar, also known as Burma, noted that the executions of the four political prisoners had occurred despite Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen, in his capacity as ASEAN chair, pushing Myanmar to reconsider. ""I urge my fellow ministers to continue to press the regime to end its brutal violence, to release those unjustly detained to allow humanitarian access and restore Burma´s path to democracy,"" Blinken said at a news conference after the foreign ministers' statement was released. ""We also have to increase economic pressure to do more to stop the flow of arms and revenue to the regime, insist on accountability for the atrocities committed."" Russia is Myanmar´s top arms supplier, and Blinken took a swipe at Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov's visit to Myanmar on his way to the ASEAN meetings and calling the country a ""friendly partner."" ""That directly flies in the face of ASEAN's hard work to bring the violence to an end,"" Blinken said. Although ASEAN has tried to project itself as a showcase of regional unity with its leaders and top diplomats locking their hands in an unusual group handshake photo-op in their annual summits, the diverse bloc has been perennially buffeted by conflicting agendas within. Following their daylong meeting on Wednesday, they delayed issuing the joint statement due to differences over the section on Myanmar, the diplomat said. Cambodia forged a compromise Thursday night which paved the way for the belated release of the weaker statement on Friday, the diplomat said. There were concerns that if a compromise was not reached, the contrasting viewpoints on Myanmar could have blocked the issuance of the statement like in a similar embarrassing incident about a decade ago when Cambodia also hosted the ministerial gathering, the diplomat said. In the 2012 meeting, the unresolved impasse centered on whether China´s increasingly aggressive actions in the disputed South China Sea should be included in the joint statement. Cambodia then was accused by the Philippines and Vietnam of blocking mention of the increasingly tense territorial conflicts. It was the first time that the bloc, founded in 1967, had failed to issue a post-conference joint statement in its history. The military's overthrow of Suu Kyi's government triggered widespread peaceful protests that were violently suppressed. They have evolved into an armed resistance and the country has slipped into what some U.N. experts characterize as a civil war. More than 2,100 people have been killed by the military government since it took power and nearly 15,000 have been arrested, according to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners, a non-governmental organization that tracks killings and arrests. ___ Gomez reported from Manila, Philippines.

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-11083513/The-AP-Interview-Samantha-Power-vs-food-crisis-Russia.html,2022-08-05,"The AP Interview: US aid chief counters food crisis, Russia","Samantha Power won fame as a human rights advocate and was picked by President Joe Biden to lead the agency that distributes billions of dollars in U.S. aid abroad, including providing more food assistance than anyone else in the world. But since Russia invaded Ukraine, that job includes a new task with a Cold War feel - countering Russia's messaging abroad. As administrator of the U.S. Agency for International Development, Power is dealing now with a global food crisis, brought on by local conflicts, the pandemic's economic upheaval, and drought and the other extremes typical of climate change. As the Biden administration spells out often, the problems have all been compounded by Russia invading Ukraine, deepening food shortages and raising prices everywhere. That set up an hearts-and-minds competition reminiscent of the days of the Soviet Union last month, when Power visited desperate families and struggling farmers in Horn of Africa nations. She watched relief workers give emergency food to children, always among the first to die in food crises, and announced new food aid. But unexpectedly, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov trailed her to Africa days later, visiting other capitals with a different message meant to shore up his country's partnerships in Africa. It was U.S. and international sanctions on Russia over its six-month invasion of Ukraine that were to blame for cutting off vital grain supplies from the world market, Lavrov claimed. He dismissed ""the so-called food crisis"" on the continent being hit hardest. In fact, a Russian blockade has kept Ukraine´s grain from reaching the world. The international sanctions on Russia exempt agricultural products and fertilizer. USAID Administrator Samantha Power is interviewed by the Associated Press, Thursday, Aug. 4, 2022, at USAID Headquarters in Washington. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin) ""What we´re not going to do, any of us in the administration, is just allow the Russian Federation, which is still saying it´s not at war in Ukraine, to blame the latest spike in food and fertilizer prices on sanctions and on the United States,"" Power, back in her office in Washington, told The Associated Press. ""People, especially when they´re facing a crisis of this enormity, they really do know the difference about ... whether you´re providing emergency humanitarian assistance ... or whether you´re at a podium trying to make it a new Cold War,"" Power said. ""For Mr. Lavrov to have traveled to Africa just after I did, there's almost nothing tangible in the wake of that visit that the countries he visited have obtained from him, other than the misinformation and lies,"" Power said. Even African officials whose governments refused to join in formal U.N. condemnation earlier this year of Russia's invasion of Ukraine tell of calling Russian leaders privately to urge Russia to let Ukraine's grain out of the ports, she said. A former journalist, Power won the Pulitzer in 2003 for ""A Problem from Hell,"" a book on genocide that has fueled debates in government and among academics on the wisdom and morality of intervening in atrocities abroad ever since. She served as U.S. ambassador to the U.N. under President Barack Obama, before joining the Biden administration. Since Russia invaded Ukraine, creating new food and energy shortfalls at a time when record numbers of people around the world were already hungry, much of Power's focus has been on the food crisis. After an earlier decade of success slicing away at the numbers of people going without food, the estimated number of people around the world going hungry rose to 828 million this year, 150 million just since the pandemic, Power said, with many in acute need. Even in countries outside areas where aid organizations warn of famine, high food prices are adding to political unrest, as in the overthrow of Sri Lanka's government this summer. ""Most analysts would be very surprised if the Sri Lankan government were the last to fall,"" Power noted. ""The cascading political effects and the instability that stems from economic pain and people's need, the human need, to hold authorities accountable for what is a terrifying inability to look out for the needs of your loved ones - that is a motivator if there ever is one"" to protest, Power said. ""This, I can't say it more starkly, is the worst food crisis of our lifetimes,"" Power said. There have been some hopeful signs in recent weeks, she pointed out - Russia allowing Ukraine to send its first ship of grain in months out of a Russian-blockaded port, and food and fuel prices easing slightly. Three more ships carrying thousands of tons of badly needed corn left the Ukraine port Friday. But in the East Africa states hardest hit - Ethiopia, Kenya, and Somalia - four rainy seasons in a row failed, withering grain in the field and killing hundreds of million of livestock that were the only support for the region's herders. ""They don't have a Plan B,"" she said. A woman farmer in Kenya told her of recoiling at the high price of fertilizer, and realizing she could only plant half as much food for the next season, a warning of even deeper hunger coming. But donor assistance for Africa's current hunger crisis is running at less than half of that for the last major one, in 2016, Power said. With no sign of an end to the war in Ukraine or to the food crisis, wealthier countries tell Power they gave much of their relief money to Ukraine and are otherwise tapped out. Tellingly, a GoFundMe-run account that Power announced in mid-July for ordinary people to help out in the global food crisis showed just $2,367 in donations on Friday. Power and other U.S. officials increasingly urge China, in particular, to give more relief. The Chinese Embassy in Washington, asked for comment, said China had given $130 million to the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization. ""That's not a talking point,"" Power said of the request to China. ""That's a sincere hope.""

China launched the drills following a visit by U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to Taiwan that infuriated Beijing, which claims the self-governed island as its own territory. Blinken told reporters on the sidelines of a meeting with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations in Cambodia, however, that Pelosi's visit was peaceful and did not represent a change in American policy toward Taiwan, accusing China of using it as a ""pretext to increase provocative military activity in and around the Taiwan Strait."" He said the situation had led to a ""vigorous communication"" during East Asia Summit meetings in Phnom Penh in which both he and Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi took part along with the ASEAN nations, Russia and others. ""I reiterated the points that we made publicly as well as directly to Chinese counterparts in recent days, again, about the fact that they should not use the visit as a pretext for war, escalation, for provocative actions, that there is no possible justification for what they´ve done and urge them to cease these actions,"" he said. Blinken did not sit down one-on-one with Wang but said he had spoken with the Chinese foreign minister already about the possibility of a Pelosi visit to Taiwan before it had taken place during meetings in Bali, and had made the U.S. position clear.

A Chinese Foreign Ministry statement said she had disregarded China´s concerns and resolute opposition to her trip. Pelosi received a euphoric welcome as the first U.S. House speaker, and highest ranking U.S. official, to visit Taiwan in more than 25 years. China opposes any engagement by Taiwanese officials with foreign governments, and has accused the U.S. of breaking the status quo with the Pelosi visit. The U.S. insists there has been no change to its ""one-China"" position of recognizing the government in Beijing, while allowing for informal relations and defense ties with Taipei. Despite the aggressive Chinese reaction to the visit, Blinken said the U.S. would also not change its ""commitment to the security of our allies in the region,"" and that the Defense Department had ordered the U.S.S. Ronald Reagan aircraft carrier group ""to remain on station in the general area to monitor the situation."" ""We will fly, sail and operate wherever international law allows,"" he said. ""We'll continue to conduct standard air and maritime transits through the Taiwan Strait, consistent with our long-standing approach to working with allies and partners to uphold freedom of navigation and overflight."" As the East Asia Summit opened, Wang patted Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov on the shoulder as he entered the room and gave the already-seated Lavrov a quick wave before taking his own seat. Lavrov waved back in response. Blinken, who entered the room last, did not even glance at Lavrov as he took his own seat about a half dozen chairs away, or at Wang who was seated farther down the same table as Lavrov. Ahead of the Phnom Penh talks, the U.S. State Department indicated Blinken had no plans to meet one-on-one with either man during the course of the meetings. Following the meetings, Lavrov told reporters there had been a lot of ""fiery statements"" about the aftermath of the Pelosi visit. ""There have been rather sharp statements from our Chinese partners, who we support,"" he told reporters. ""And there have been responses from the U.S. and Japan that it´s not China´s business and that the declared policy of supporting the one-China principle doesn´t mean one has to ask Beijing for permission to visit Taiwan. Surely, it´s a weird logic."" The talks came a day after WNBA star Brittney Griner was convicted of drug possession and sentenced to nine years in prison by Russia in a politically charged case amid antagonisms over the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Blinken said the conviction and sentence ""compounds the injustice that has been done to her."" ""It puts a spotlight on our very significant concern with Russia´s legal system and the Russian government´s use of wrongful detentions to advance its own agenda using individuals as political pawns,"" he said. Blinken has suggested the possibility of a prisoner swap for Griner and another American jailed in Russia, Paul Whelan, but Lavrov told reporters that such a deal could only be decided upon by Russian President Vladimir Putin and U.S. President Joe Biden. ""We´re ready to discuss this topic, but to discuss it within the channel that was agreed on by presidents Putin and Biden,"" Lavrov said on the sidelines of the ASEAN meeting. On Thursday, China canceled a foreign ministers´ meeting with Japan to protest a statement from the Group of Seven industrialized nations that said there was no justification for Beijing's military exercises, which virtually encircle Taiwan. ""Japan, together with other member of the G-7 and the EU, made an irresponsible statement accusing China and confounding right and wrong,"" Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said in Beijing. When Japanese Foreign Minister Hayashi Yoshimasa began to speak Friday at the East Asia Summit, both Lavrov and Wang walked out of the room, according to a diplomat in the room who spoke on condition of anonymity in order to discuss the private session. In the wake of the Chinese missile launches into Japan's economic zone, Blinken said the U.S. stands in ""strong solidarity"" with Japan following the ""dangerous actions China has taken."" ___ Associated Press writer Jim Gomez in Manila, Philippines, contributed to this report.

""Nobody wanted to even play today,"" said Phoenix guard Skylar Diggins-Smith, who scored 16 points to lead the Mercury. ""How are you supposed to approach the game and court with a clear mind? The whole group is crying before the game. You try to honor her and still play hard for her. Regardless of whether she´s here or not. Right now, we still got to try and keep her spirit alive. Honor her spirit."" The Mercury watched the verdict together in the morning right before the team had its pregame shootaround. ""I mean, it's like you're waiting for a bomb to drop watching it, seeing her behind bars,"" Mercury guard Diamond DeShields said. Diggins added that it was ""a helpless feeling. It's heavy.""

""You can´t say anything other than that. I know personally, I'm really proud to be part of this group and the way they showed up and came out and played. We approached the game tonight with a heavy heart, as we have every game this season."" Sun coach Curt Miller wore a ""WE ARE BG"" t-shirt. Griner, a two-time U.S. Olympic champion and a eight-time WNBA all-star, was convicted of drug possession and smuggling by Judge Anna Sotnikova. She was sentenced for nearly a decade in a politically charged case that could lead to a high-stakes prisoner exchange between Washington and Moscow. Griner showed little emotion to the sentence, but her lawyers said later she was ""very upset, very stressed."" U.S. President Joe Biden denounced as ""unacceptable"" the verdict and sentence, which came amid soaring tensions between the U.S. and Russia over Ukraine. Griner had told the court she had no intention to break the law by bringing vape cartridges with cannabis oil when she flew to Moscow to play basketball in the city of Yekaterinburg during the WNBA offseason. While her short-handed WNBA team played without her on the road, Jonquel Jones had 14 points and 10 rebounds and Brionna Jones added 13 points and nine rebounds for the Sun. Phoenix (13-19) was also without Diana Taurasi, who didn't play due to a leg injury, for the first time this season. Courtney Williams scored 11 points and Alyssa Thomas had nine points, 13 rebounds and six assists for Connecticut (22-10).

One of those gathered was Eugenia Vasylieva who last saw her husband Valeriy Vasyliev in Mariupol on the night of Feb. 24, the day of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. That night he went to defend his city. Her 7-year-old daughter Zlata Vasylieva, holding a placard calling for her father's return, said: ""I want my dad to be alive and that he never die."" Russia has claimed that Ukraine´s military used U.S.-supplied rocket launchers to strike the prison in Olenivka, a settlement controlled by the Moscow-backed Donetsk People´s Republic. The Ukrainian military denied making any rocket or artillery strikes in Olenivka. The intelligence arm of the Ukrainian defense ministry claimed in a statement Wednesday to have evidence that local Kremlin-backed separatists colluded with the Russian FSB, the KGB´s main successor agency, and mercenary group Wagner to mine the barrack before ""using a flammable substance, which led to the rapid spread of fire in the room."" The ex-commander of the Ukrainian national guard's Azov Regiment, Maksym Zhorin, told the AP there were around 1,500 defenders of Mariupol in Olenivka before the explosion. They were part of 2,400 soldiers from the Azov Regiment and other military units defending Mariupol who surrendered under orders from Ukraine´s military in May. ""But there were 100-150 people in the facility that was blown up,"" said Zhorin. He said the conditions in the block where the prisoners of war were being held were not suitable for living. The facility was not located next to the other barracks but on the outskirts of the prison near the warehouses.

(AP Photo/Efrem Lukatsky) U.S. officials believe Russia is working to fabricate evidence concerning the strike. U.S. intelligence officials have determined that Russia is looking to plant false evidence to make it appear that Ukrainian forces were responsible for the July 29 attack on the prison, which left 53 dead and wounded dozens more, a U.S. official familiar with the intelligence finding told The Associated Press on Wednesday. Zhorin says Ukraine has extremely little time to get to the crime site and to the witnesses who can give accounts of what really happened. ""We cannot be sure they will be alive tomorrow, that the Russians will not kill them. So far, nothing prevents them from doing it,"" Zhorin said. Relatives of prisoners of war are increasingly frustrated at the lack of information they are getting about the fate of their loved ones. They are looking to the International Committee of the Red Cross for answers because of the role the humanitarian organization played when Ukrainian fighters came out of the Azovstal steel mill and surrendered to Russian forces. ""Our goal is to reach the Red Cross, to say that they are not fulfilling their duties. We entrusted them with the lives of our boys. And it shouldn´t be like this that the Red Cross is now saying they are not responsible for anything,"" Iryna Yermoshyna, the wife of a POW, said. The scope of ICRC's responsibility remains a source of confusion. Following the prison attack, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called on the Red Cross and the United Nations to react. ""When the defenders of Azovstal left the plant, the U.N. and the International Committee of the Red Cross acted as guarantors of the life and health of our soldiers,"" Zelenskyy said. However, Oleksandr Vlasenko, a spokesperson for the ICRC´s delegation in Ukraine, said the organization's guarantor role was a limited one. ""We guaranteed safety only during the capture of Azovstal combatants. That is, until the moment when they boarded the buses,"" he said. Kateryna Chyzykova saw the name of her husband on the list of wounded soldiers that Russia's Ministry of Defense published after the prison explosion. She says she's tried to contact the ICRC to try and find out about her husband's condition but has so far been unsuccessful. ""My husband left Azovstal, trusting the Red Cross,"" said Chyzykova. Zhorin says the list of casualties published by the Russian side is incorrect. He said among those listed as dead were names of people who died even before the explosion in Olenivka. ""Unfortunately, we already know that there are more dead POWs. There are victims who died in the hospital or on the way to the hospital,"" Zhorin said. So far the ICRC has not been able to access Olenivka and the wounded, so they have been unable to verify the list of names. Earlier this week, Russia´s Supreme Court declared Ukraine´s Azov Regiment a terrorist organization, a move that some fear could lead to terror charges against some of the captured fighters who made their last stand inside Mariupol´s shattered steel plant and make it more difficult to verify who was at the blast site. The Azov regiment that was stationed in Mariupol is part of the National Guard. Other units of Azov, which exist throughout the country, are part of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. They are under the command of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and the commander-in-chief during the war. ""All of these are official units that certainly cannot be separately recognized as terrorist organizations. This is part of the entire defense of Ukraine,´´ Zhorin said. Zhorin believes that Russia made the ruling so they could put members of the Azov regiment on trial. Before the ruling, they could not hold a trial against fighters as their status as prisoners of war gave them protection under the Geneva Conventions. Moscow has repeatedly portrayed the Azov Regiment as a Nazi group and accused it of atrocities but has publicly produced little evidence. The regiment, a unit within Ukraine´s National Guard, has a checkered past. It grew out of a group called the Azov Battalion, formed in 2014 as one of many volunteer brigades created to fight Russia-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine. The battalion drew its initial fighters from far-right circles. While its current members reject accusations of extremism, the Kremlin has seized on the regiment´s right-wing origins to cast Russia´s invasion as a battle against Nazi influence in Ukraine. Meanwhile, covered in artificial blood, Olha stood in the Kyiv square with a message for her boyfriend who is in captivity.

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-11082303/US-Africa-buy-Russian-grain-risks-actions-oil.html,2022-08-04,US: Africa can buy Russian grain but risks actions on oil,"African nations are free to buy grain from Russia but could face consequences if they trade in U.S.-sanctioned commodities such as Russian oil, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations said Thursday. ""Countries can buy Russian agricultural products, including fertilizer and wheat,"" Linda Thomas-Greenfield said. But she added that ""if a country decides to engage with Russia, where there are sanctions, then they are breaking those sanctions."" ""We caution countries not to break those sanctions because then ... they stand the chance of having actions taken against them,"" she said. Thomas-Greenfield spoke in the Ugandan capital, Kampala, after a meeting with President Yoweri Museveni, a U.S. ally who has not criticized Russia´s invasion of Ukraine and has expressed sympathy with Moscow. Uganda is the U.S. official's first stop on an African tour that will include visits to Ghana and Cape Verde. Her trip comes a week after the Africa visit of Sergey Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister, who dismissed charges that his country's invasion of Ukraine is solely responsible for a dangerous food crisis in countries ranging from Somalia to South Sudan. Lavrov blamed food shortages in the market on ""the absolutely inadequate reaction of the West, which announced sanctions"" following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield speaks to the media at the residence of the U.S. Ambassador to Uganda, in the capital Kampala, Uganda Thursday, Aug. 4, 2022. . (AP Photo/Hajarah Nalwadda) Ukraine and Russia are key global suppliers of wheat, barley, corn and sunflower oil, with fighting in the Black Sea region, known as t he ""breadbasket of the world,"" pushing up food prices, threatening political stability in developing nations and leading countries to ban some food exports. Many African countries - including some with areas that are on the threshold of famine - depend heavily on grain imports from Russia and Ukraine. Thomas-Greenfield insisted that sanctions imposed by Washington are not to blame for rising food prices in Africa and elsewhere. She said the U.S. seeks to strengthen existing partnerships in African countries such as Uganda and spoke of Museveni, an authoritarian who has held power for 36 years, as a regional leader with whom the U.S. has ""mutual interests."" Uganda is one of 25 African nations that abstained or didn´t vote in the U.N. General Assembly resolution condemning Russia´s invasion of Ukraine earlier this year. Many countries on the continent of 1.3 billion people have long-standing ties with Moscow, dating back to the Cold War when the Soviet Union supported their anti-colonial struggles. Museveni said during Lavrov's visit that Russia has been a friend to the East African country for more than 100 years, suggesting he felt under pressure to support the U.S. position on the war in Ukraine.

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-11082245/EXPLAINER-What-Brittney-Griner-home.html,2022-08-04,EXPLAINER: What will it take to get Brittney Griner home?,"Now that WNBA star Brittney Griner has been convicted of drug possession and sentenced to nine years in prison, attention turns to the prospect of a prisoner swap between the United States and Russia that could get her home. Secretary of State Antony Blinken went public with that possibility last week, revealing in an unusual announcement that the U.S. had made a ""substantial proposal"" aimed at securing the release of Griner and another jailed American, Paul Whelan. With her court case concluded and her sentence pronounced, such a deal - assuming one can be reached with the Russians - is Griner's best chance of being freed early. Though the guilty verdict was seen as a foregone conclusion, the imposition of a sentence her lawyers decried as far longer than average could give the U.S. extra impetus to strike a deal palatable to Russia as soon as possible. And the formal end of the court case could be the opening both sides need to forge a diplomatic resolution, too. A look at what's at stake: WHAT DID THE U.S. OFFER? WNBA star and two-time Olympic gold medalist Brittney Griner is escorted from a court room ater a hearing, in Khimki just outside Moscow, Russia, Thursday, Aug. 4, 2022. A judge in Russia has convicted American basketball star Brittney Griner of drug possession and smuggling and sentenced her to nine years in prison. (AP Photo/Alexander Zemlianichenko) Blinken did not specify the terms other than to describe the offer as substantial and something that he intended to discuss with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. A person familiar with the situation said that the U.S. offered to release Viktor Bout, a convicted Russian arms dealer serving a 25-year prison sentence on charges that he conspired to sell tens of millions of dollars in weapons to Colombia´s former FARC guerrilla army. At the time of his conviction, the group was classified by the U.S. as a foreign terrorist organization, though that designation was lifted last year. The officials did wind up speaking by phone last Friday, the highest-level known contact between the two sides since Russia invaded Ukraine. They are also in Cambodia for meetings involving foreign ministers of Southeast Asian countries. WHAT HAS BEEN THE RUSSIAN RESPONSE? Minimal, at least in public. Blinken did not provide details after his call with Lavrov about his response. The Russians gave no hint about their interest in the offer, other than a statement chiding the U.S. to pursue the Americans´ freedom through ""quiet diplomacy, without releases of speculative information."" On Monday, White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said the Russian government had responded in a ""bad faith"" manner with an offer that U.S. officials did not regard as serious. She did not elaborate, though CNN reported last week that Moscow also wanted the release of a former colonel from one of its spy agencies who was convicted of murder in Germany last year. WOULD THERE BE A PRECEDENT FOR A PRISONER SWAP? In many ways, yes - and a recent one too. In April, Russia traded Marine veteran Trevor Reed, convicted of a physical altercation with police in Moscow, for Konstantin Yaroshenko, a Russian pilot imprisoned for a cocaine trafficking conspiracy. Yet that involved a Russian with far less notoriety than Bout, a former Soviet air force officer who once inspired a Hollywood movie and who earned the nickname the ""Merchant of Death"" over allegations that he supplied weapons used for civil wars in countries around the globe. He has adamantly maintained his innocence. But there's not much recent precedent for public discussions of prisoner swaps, at least by the U.S. government, before the deal is done and planes are in the air. That's what made Blinken's announcement from the State Department briefing room all the more striking. On one hand, it seemed intended to communicate to the public that the administration will do whatever it needs to do to bring home wrongfully detained Americans. But such a public overture also risks weakening the administration's negotiating hand to the extent it makes the U.S. look overly desperate for a deal, or signals to other countries that it is willing to meet potentially unreasonable demands. SO WILL THE DEAL TAKE PLACE? It's hard to say, but the contact between Blinken and Lavrov does suggest more progress than has been made before. It also reinforces the idea that the two countries are willing to maintain communication despite extraordinary tensions related to Moscow's invasion of Ukraine. Griner is the most prominent American detained by a foreign country. She is a two-time Olympic gold medalist detained since February when police said they found vape cartridges containing cannabis oil in her luggage at an airport in Moscow. And though some Republicans including former President Donald Trump have expressed opposition to a deal, the conviction and sentence will only ramp up pressure on the administration to reach an agreement that can get her out soon. ""Today´s sentencing of Brittney Griner was severe by Russian legal standards and goes to prove what we have known all along, that Brittney is being used as a political pawn,"" Lindsay Kagawa Colas, Griner's agent, tweeted Thursday. She said getting a deal done for Griner and Whelan, a Michigan corporate security executive imprisoned on an espionage conviction he and his family says is baseless, may be difficult but it is ""urgent"" and the ""right thing to do."" The U.S. government also regards Whelan as wrongfully convicted. For their part, Russian authorities have suggested that they regard a conviction as basically a prerequisite for a prisoner swap. On Thursday, President Joe Biden again urged Russia to release Griner immediately. ""My administration will continue to work tirelessly and pursue every possible avenue to bring Brittney and Paul Whelan home safely as soon as possible,"" he said in a statement. ___ Follow Eric Tucker on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/etuckerAP WNBA star and two-time Olympic gold medalist Brittney Griner listens to the verdict standing in a cage in a courtroom in Khimki just outside Moscow, Russia, Thursday, Aug. 4, 2022.

The government said the African migrants include individuals passing through Russia, a close ally and another neighbor of Belarus, as well as people who were in Russia for a longer period. In an emailed statement to The Associated Press, the Polish government described the migration as part of a ""hybrid operation aimed at destabilizing the NATO eastern flank."" Migrants and asylum-seekers have tried to cross from Belarus into Poland and Lithuania, and to a lesser extent Latvia, since last summer. The three nations are in the east of both European Union and NATO territory. The countries have sought to discourage the attempted crossings, detaining migrants and pushing them back into Belarus. Poland recently completed a tall steel wall along 186 kilometers (115 miles) of its land frontier with Belarus. Human rights organizations have criticized Poland and Lithuania, saying the migrants include people fleeing persecution who have the right under international law to request asylum.

(AP Photo/Michal Dyjuk, File) European leaders accuse Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko of creating a new and artificial migration route in order to destabilize the EU. The government of Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki has said it believes Russia bears some responsibility too, given its alliance with Lukashenko. Early on, most of the people who tried to enter the EU from Belarus were Afghans, Syrians, Kurds from Iraq and others from the Middle East. After the arrival of large numbers last summer, the EU intervened, including by getting Iraq to stop the flights, and the migration flow slowed. It never stopped altogether, but the situation became overshadowed by the far larger numbers of Ukrainian refugees who were welcomed in Poland after Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February. The National Security Department within the prime minister's office told the AP that current Border Guard statistics show that the vast majority of migrants who seek to illegally cross at the Poland-Belarus border now come from Sub-Saharan Africa. They ""possess Russian visas and it is via Russia that they reach Belarus,"" it said. ""(They) have visas issued for studies or work, but according to testimonies acquired by the Border Guard, they have never had such plans and they used visas only to get through the migratory route. Simultaneously, the Russian administration facilitates the procedure of obtaining the visas,"" the government said. ""Among migrants, there are also people who have been in Russia for a longer period of time."" ""The actions undertaken by Russia and Belarus confirm that the artificially created migratory route is controlled and coordinated by these two regimes and in future we should expect that the hybrid operation aimed at destabilizing NATO´s eastern flank will only intensify,"" it added. Border Guard data shows that there were 914 attempts to cross illegally from Belarus into Poland in July. ___ Follow AP´s global migration coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/migration FILE - A Polish border guard patrols the area of a newly built metal wall on the border between Poland and Belarus, near Kuznice, Poland, Thursday, June 30, 2022.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy angrily denounced the report, saying Amnesty International ""tries to amnesty the terrorist state and shift the responsibility from the aggressor to the victim."" ""If you provide manipulative reports,"" Zelenskyy said in his nightly video address, ""then you share the responsibility for the death of people with them."" AP journalists observed several scenes in recent weeks that mirrored the findings of Amnesty's researchers, including the aftermath of weapon strikes in eastern Ukraine where Ukrainian fighters, their vehicles or items such as ammunition were at attack sites. At two locations, the AP was told a soldier or soldiers had been killed. At a third, emergency workers blocked reporters from filming victims of a Russian strike on a residential building, which was unusual; locals said military personnel had been staying there. In a report released Thursday, Amnesty International said its researchers, between April and July, ""found evidence of Ukrainian forces launching strikes from within populated residential areas, as well as basing themselves in civilian buildings in 19 towns and villages"" in three regions. A mother pushes her child in a carriage through a puddle after a rainstorm in Pokrovsk, Donetsk region, eastern Ukraine, Thursday, Aug. 4, 2022. (AP Photo/David Goldman) Amnesty also said it found Ukrainian forces using hospitals as military bases in five places, in ""a clear violation of international humanitarian law."" The report noted that parties to a conflict must ""avoid locating, to the maximum extent feasible, military objectives within or near densely populated areas."" Combatants also must remove civilians from the ""vicinity of military objectives"" and warn of possible attacks, the report said, adding that ""viable alternatives were available that would not endanger civilians, such as military bases or densely wooded areas nearby, or other structures further away from residential areas."" At the same time, its authors stressed that the ""Ukrainian military´s practice of locating military objectives within populated areas does not in any way justify indiscriminate Russian attacks."" Ukrainian authorities have repeatedly asked the remaining residents of the Donetsk region to evacuate, but starting anew elsewhere is not that easy. Tens of thousands of people who left their homes since Russia's invasion have returned after running out of support or feeling unwelcome. The AP reported last week that one evacuee was killed in a missile strike two days after returning home to the city of Pokrovsk in Donetsk. Neighbors expressed anger that Ukrainian fighters had set up base in their residential area on the city´s outskirts. As AP journalists looked at the missile crater, a uniformed fighter walked over from the adjacent plot of land and questioned their presence. In the city of Kramatorsk, closer to the front line, residents told the AP after a strike in a residential area that soldiers had been staying there. The AP saw soldiers entering and leaving a Kramatorsk apartment building hit by a separate strike. And in Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, the AP saw soldiers and military vehicles at a teaching university that was hit. Soldiers and supplies also were present at a school for the disabled where a Russian strike left two craters in the schoolyard. Aside from witness accounts, Amnesty International relied on satellite imagery and remote sensing. Its researchers heard outgoing fire from nearby Ukrainian positions while examining damaged residential areas in the regions of Kharkiv, Mykolaiv and Donbas. The Donbas region, which consists of Donetsk and Luhansk provinces, is where the war's most intense fighting has taken place since April. The mother of a man killed in a rocket attack in a village near Mykolaiv told researchers that Ukrainian forces had stayed in a house next to theirs. The researchers found military uniforms and equipment there, according to the report. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba released a video statement denouncing the report as ""unfair"" and expressing his outrage about it. ""Such behavior by AI is not about seeking the truth and bringing it to the world, it is about creating a false balance between a criminal and a victim, between a country that is annihilating civilian populations by the hundreds and the thousands, (is destroying) cities and entire areas, and a country that is desperately defending itself, saving its people and the continent from this invasion,"" Kuleba said. Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov also weighed in with a Facebook post. ""Any attempts to even in passing equate the unprovoked Russian aggression and Ukraine's self-defense, like it is done in the Amnesty International report, is evidence of losing adequacy and a way to destroy one's authority,"" Reznikov wrote. Presidential advisor Mykhailo Podolyak, in turn, accused the group on Twitter of participating in a ""disinformation and propaganda campaign"" by Moscow to discredit Ukraine's armed forces. Russian state and pro-Kremlin media have extensively quoted the report, whose findings somewhat align with Moscow´s official narrative. Russia has justified attacks on civilian areas by alleging that Ukrainian fighters are setting up firing positions there. ""We´re talking about it all the time, calling the actions of Ukraine´s armed forces the tactics of using the civilian population as a `human shield,´"" Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova wrote on Telegram of the report. Ukrainian soldiers also have routinely based themselves in schools, Amnesty said. Even though Ukraine's schools have been closed since Russia´s invasion, most are near residential neighborhoods. The rights group's researchers found soldiers or evidence of military activity at 22 out of 29 schools visited. ""In at least three towns, after Russian bombardment of the schools, Ukrainian soldiers moved to other schools nearby, putting the surrounding neighborhoods at risk of similar attacks,"" the report said. The full scope of the issue is unknown. A Human Rights Watch report last month identified three occasions when Ukrainian forces were based among residential homes and four occasions when Russian forces set up military bases in populated areas of Ukraine. ___ Follow AP's coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine"

One casket was opened to reveal the military fatigues-clad body of 48-year-old Oleh Panchenko, which bore visible face injuries. ""Our hero, I will be proud of you forever,"" Panchenko's mother, Lilia, said through fits of uncontrolled sobbing as she leant over her son, kissing his forehead. ""God, why are you taking our boys from us?"" The funeral in Pokrovsk brought to 20 the number of Ukrainian soldiers buried there, in a newer section of the cemetery dedicated to military fatalities. Nearly all of them were killed since Russia's invasion began on Feb. 24, though others fell during the last eight years of fighting between Ukrainian forces and Russian-backed separatists over control of the eastern Donbas region. As Russian forces continue to make slow gains in the Donetsk province, which makes up half of Donbas, Ukraine's government is providing funeral services for soldiers killed in the fighting, and benefits for family members left behind.

The grieving family members jumped as gunshots rang out in the cemetery - from three Ukrainian soldiers performing a three-volley salute in honor of the dead. As the priest finished the rites, Lilia, Panchenko's mother, brushed flies off her son´s face with an embroidered handkerchief until it was time to cover his body and lower the coffin into the grave. ""Wait, just wait!"" she cried as family members pulled her away, before the coffin was finally closed. Panchenko's daughter, Ruslana, said he was an experienced soldier and squad commander who volunteered for the front line after hearing of alleged Russian atrocities in Irpin and Bucha, suburbs of the capital Kyiv. He was killed on July 27 after serving nearly five months on the front, she said, and was the only survivor in his unit after heavy fighting in Zolote in the Luhansk region.

Dnipropetrovsk's regional governor said Russia fired 60 rockets at Nikopol, across the Dnieper River from the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, which has been under Russian supervision since Moscow's troops seized it early in the war. Some 50 residential buildings were damaged in the city of 107,000, and residents were left without electricity, Valentyn Reznichenko wrote on Telegram. Rafael Grossi, director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, had warned on Tuesday that the situation was becoming more perilous daily at the Zaporizhzhia plant in the city of Enerhodar. ""Every principle of nuclear safety has been violated"" at the plant, he said. ""What is at stake is extremely serious and extremely grave and dangerous."" He expressed concern about the way the plant is being operated and the danger posed by the fighting going on around it. He cited shelling at the beginning of the war when it was taken over and continuing instances of Ukraine and Russia accusing each other of attacks there. A couple reacts after the Russian shelling in Mykolaiv, Ukraine, Wednesday, Aug. 3, 2022. According local media, supermarket, high-rise buildings and pharmacy were damaged. (AP Photo/Kostiantyn Liberov) Experts at the U.S.-based Institute for the Study of War said they believe Russia is shelling the area intentionally, ""putting Ukraine in a difficult position."" ""Either Ukraine returns fire, risking international condemnation and a nuclear incident - which Ukrainian forces are unlikely to do - or Ukrainian forces allow Russian forces to continue firing on Ukrainian positions from an effective `safe zone,´"" the think tank said. The Russian capture of Zaporizhzhia renewed fears that the largest of Ukraine´s four nuclear power plants could be damaged, setting off an emergency like the 1986 Chernobyl accident, the world´s worst nuclear disaster, which happened about 110 kilometers (65 miles) north of the capital, Kyiv. Also in the Zaporizhzhia region, Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Lt. Gen. Igor Konashenkov said the Russian military struck two Ukrainian munitions depots near the village of Novoivanivka and a fuel depot near the Zaporizhzhia railway station. In northern Ukraine, the country's second-largest city, Kharkiv, was shelled by the Russians, Ukraine's presidential office said. Several industrial sites were hit in the city, which has been a frequent target. In the nearby city of Chuhuiv, a rocket hit a five-story residential building. Fighting continued in the fiercely contested Donetsk region in the east, with Ukrainian authorities saying a school was destroyed in the village of Ocheretyne. The attacks have disrupted supplies of gas, water and power, and the region's residents are being evacuated. In the town of Toretsk, artillery shells hit a bus stop, a church and apartment buildings, killing at least eight people, regional Gov. Pavlo Kyrylenko said. In the city of Donetsk, Russian-backed separatist authorities accused Ukrainian forces of shelling the central part of the city Thursday. The area hit was near a theater where a farewell ceremony for a prominent separatist officer killed a few days ago was being held. Donetsk Mayor Alexei Kulemzin said six people were killed. Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, denied Ukrainian involvement. He alleged, without offering evidence, that Russian or separatist forces were responsible for the shelling. Russia and Ukraine have repeatedly accused each other of firing on territories under their own control. Russian forces have already seized the Luhansk region that neighbors Donetsk. Its Ukrainian governor, Serhiy Haidai, said on social media that local residents are being mobilized by the Russian side to fight against Kyiv's forces and that ""even indispensable mine workers are being taken."" Ukrainian authorities reported another abduction of a mayor who reportedly refused to collaborate with the Russians in the southern Kherson region, which is also almost entirely occupied. The reported kidnapping of Serhiy Lyakhno, mayor of the village of Hornostaivka, comes as Russia amasses more troops in the area in anticipation of a counteroffensive by Kyiv and ahead of a planned referendum on the region becoming part of Russia. ___ Follow AP´s coverage of the Russia-Ukraine war at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine A woman stands in the aftermath of the Russian shelling in Mykolaiv, Ukraine, Wednesday, Aug. 3, 2022.

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-11080189/Ship-Ukraine-says-carrying-stolen-grain-leaves-Lebanon.html,2022-08-04,Ship Ukraine says is carrying stolen grain leaves Lebanon,"A Syrian ship that Ukraine says is carrying stolen Ukrainian grain has left a Lebanese port after officials in Lebanon allowed it to sail following an investigation, Lebanon´s transport minister tweeted on Thursday. The Syrian-flagged Laodicea had been anchored at the port of Tripoli since it arrived last Thursday, carrying 10,000 tons of wheat flour and barley. Ukraine says the grain was stolen by Russia, a claim Moscow denies. On Wednesday, Ukrainian Ambassador to Lebanon Ihor Ostash urged Lebanon not to allow the vessel to leave the port. A judge on Wednesday said the Laodicea can sail, a day after Lebanon´s prosecutor general decided the ship could leave after an investigation showed it was not carrying stolen Ukrainian grain. Transport Minister Ali Hamie tweeted that the ""Syrian-flagged Laodicea is now outside Lebanon's territorial waters."" Syria's transport ministry said in a statement later Thursday that the ship arrived in the port of Tartus, adding that the material is being offloaded. It said that the ship earlier went to Tripoli for a brief stop to hand an amount of flour to a Lebanese company, then sail to Tartus. This frame grab from a video provided on Friday, July 29, 2022, shows A Syrian cargo ship Laodicea docked at a seaport, in Tripoli, north Lebanon. Lebanon appeared Friday to reject claims by the Ukrainian Embassy in Beirut that a Syrian ship docked in a Lebanese port is carrying Ukrainian grain stolen by Russia, following an inspection by Lebanese customs officials. (AP Photo) The ministry called statements by the Ukrainian embassy in Beirut that the ship is carrying stolen grain as ""claims"" that aim to support the American administration and its allies who have imposed sanctions on the Syrian government over the country's 11-year conflict. ""The ship as well as all of our ships will continue to guarantee the needs of our people,"" the transport ministry said. Laodicea's departure from Tripoli is likely to anger Ukraine. Russia´s diplomatic mission in Lebanon praised the move, accusing Ukraine of lying about the cargo and trying to damage relations between Moscow and Beirut. The U.S. Treasury Department sanctioned the Syrian ship in 2015 for its affiliation with the Syrian government of President Bashar Assad, a close political and military ally to Moscow. The spat over the Laodicea came as the first grain ship left Ukraine since Russia's invasion in late February. The Sierra Leone-flagged Razoni, carrying 26,000 tons of Ukrainian corn, was passing through Turkey on route to Lebanon. A Lebanese official told The Associated Press on Wednesday that the ship is expected to take about four days to arrive to Lebanon from Istanbul after it was searched. Lebanon condemned Russia´s invasion of Ukraine in February, which angered Moscow and its allies in Beirut. The shipments come at a time when Lebanon is suffering from a food security crisis, with soaring food inflation, wheat shortages and breadlines. Three-quarters of its population lives in poverty."
https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-11080145/Bank-England-likely-raise-rates--maybe-lot.html,2022-08-04,Bank of England predicts recession at the end of the year,"The Bank of England announced its biggest interest rate increase in 27 years on Thursday as it forecast that the war in Ukraine would fuel further inflation and tip the U.K. economy into a prolonged recession. Soaring natural gas prices are likely to drive consumer price inflation to 13.3% in October, from 9.4% in June, the bank said. That will push Britain into recession later this year, with economic output declining each quarter from the fourth quarter of 2022 through the fourth quarter of 2023, bank forecasts show. Those pressures persuaded the bank´s Monetary Policy Committee to boost its key interest rate by 0.5 percentage points, the biggest of six consecutive increases since December. The rate now stands at 1.75%, the highest since the depths of the global financial crisis in late 2008. Gov. Andrew Bailey defended the move, which will increase borrowing costs for consumers, saying the bank has a duty to control price increases that disproportionately affect the poorest in society. ""I recognize the significant impact this will have and how difficult the cost of living challenge will continue to be for many people in the United Kingdom,´´ Bailey said at a news conference. ""Inflation hits the least well-off hardest. But if we don´t act against inflation becoming persistent, the consequences later will be worse."" Central banks worldwide are struggling to balance efforts to control inflation while minimizing the fallout for economies that were just beginning to recover from the coronavirus pandemic. Higher interest rates increase borrowing costs for businesses and consumers, which tends to reduce spending and ease rising prices. But such moves also slow economic growth. People wait at the Bank of England in London, Thursday, Aug. 4, 2022. The Bank of England will hold the Monetary Policy Report Press Conference on interest rates that are expected to go up by half a percentage point, which would be the biggest rise in 27 years. (AP Photo/Frank Augstein) The inflation picture has worsened in recent months as Russia cut natural gas shipments to Europe in retaliation for the west´s support of Ukraine. That has triggered unprecedented increases in energy prices worldwide. The Bank of England estimates that gas and electricity bills will eat up an additional 3.5% of household incomes in the period from 2021-2023. That´s five times more than the increase British households experienced during the energy crisis of the 1970s. Although it was the first major central bank to start raising rates in December, the Bank of England has faced criticism in recent months as its peers began to move more aggressively. The U.S. Federal Reserve increased its key rate by three-quarters of a point in each of the past two months to a range of 2.25% to 2.5%. The U.S. economy shrank for a second straight quarter in the April through June period, raising fears that the nation may be approaching a recession. The European Central Bank last month approved a larger-than-expected half-point increase as it targeted persistently high inflation. Recession is also a growing concern in Europe, where falling gas supplies may force factories to reduce operations this winter. Victoria Scholar, head of investment at interactive investor, said the Bank of England approved a big increase because it didn´t want to fall behind the curve. The real risk is ""stagflation,"" a prolonged period of economic stagnation combined with rapidly rising prices that can be very difficult to get out of, she said. ""It´s very much doom and gloom from the Bank of England, and not least the fact that it´s decided to carry out this almost double rate hike,"" Scholar said. The central bank´s actions have become an issue in the contest to replace Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who will step down next month. Supporters of Foreign Secretary Liz Truss, the leading candidate to succeed Johnson, said Thursday she would revisit the question of whether the bank should remain independent. The Bank of England has been independent of government control since 1997. The last time the U.K. increased interest rates by 0.5 percentage points was in December 1994, when rate decisions were still made by the government´s treasury chief in consultation with the central bank governor. Bailey declined to respond to questions about the bank´s independence, saying he hopes to work closely with whoever becomes prime minister. The current landscape is especially complicated for central bank policy makers because many of the factors driving inflation are determined by international events beyond their control. A first wave of inflation was triggered by international supply bottlenecks and increased demand for energy as the coronavirus pandemic began to ease last year. That was followed quickly by Russia´s invasion of Ukraine, which triggered sharp increases in food and energy prices. Those pressures are expected to dissipate over time, and there are signs that prices for some goods are beginning to fall, the Bank of England said. But inflation is now becoming embedded in the U.K. economy, with business owners raising prices and workers demanding wage increases to protect their living standards. That is what the central bank is targeting with Thursday´s rate increase. Inflation is expected to slow to 9.5% in the third quarter of 2023 and drop in line with the 2% target a year later, the central bank forecast. But Bailey said the uncertainty about these forecasts is ""exceptionally large"" because there is no way to predict what will happen with energy prices. ""The committee will be particularly alert to any indications of more persistent inflationary pressures and will, if necessary, act forcefully in response."" Governor of the Bank of England, Andrew Bailey speaks during the Bank of England's financial stability report press conference, at the Bank of England, London, Thursday, Aug. 4, 2022. The Bank of England says the United Kingdom's economy is projected to enter a recession in the final three months of the year. The bank said Thursday that inflation will accelerate to over 13% in the fourth quarter and remain ""very elevated,"" for much of 2023.

The 31-year-old Griner, a two-time U.S. Olympic champion and a eight-time all-star with the WNBA´s Phoenix Mercury, listened with a blank expression as an interpreter translated the verdict by Judge Anna Sotnikova, but her lawyers said later she was ""very upset."" Griner also was fined 1 million rubles (about $16,700). U.S. President Joe Biden denounced as ""unacceptable"" the verdict and sentence, which came amid soaring tensions between the U.S. and Russia over Ukraine. ""I call on Russia to release her immediately so she can be with her wife, loved ones, friends and teammates,"" Biden said, adding that he would continue to work to bring home Griner and Paul Whelan, an American imprisoned in Russia on an espionage conviction. Outside court, the U.S. Embassy's charge d´affaires Elizabeth Rood called the outcome ""a miscarriage of justice."" Griner, recognized as one of the greatest players in WNBA history, has been detained since Feb. 17 after police said they found vape cartridges containing cannabis oil in her luggage upon landing at Moscow´s Sheremetyevo Airport. She was returning to Russia, where she has competed since 2014. WNBA star and two-time Olympic gold medalist Brittney Griner is escorted from a court room ater a hearing, in Khimki just outside Moscow, Russia, Thursday, Aug. 4, 2022. A judge in Russia has convicted American basketball star Brittney Griner of drug possession and smuggling and sentenced her to nine years in prison. (AP Photo/Alexander Zemlianichenko) As she was led out of court, Griner said: ""I love my family."" The nine-year sentence was close to the maximum of 10 years that Griner had faced under the charges. Most Russians possessing small quantities of drugs get at most five years in prison, lawyers said. Defense attorney Maria Blagovolina told reporters later that Griner was ""very upset, very stressed. She can hardly talk. It´s a difficult time for her."" Before the unusually swift verdict was reached, an emotional Griner apologized to her family, teammates and the Russian city of Yekaterinburg, where she plays in the WNBA offseason, ""for my mistake that I made and the embarrassment that I brought on them."" With her voice cracking, she added: ""I hope in your ruling it does not end my life."" Griner has 10 days to appeal, and her lawyers say they expect a hearing in Moscow regional court next week. Asked if Griner could ask for pardon from President Vladimir Putin, Blagovolina said they would consider every possibility, but the lawyers said they were not part of any discussions about a prisoner swap. Griner´s agent Lindsay Kagawa Colas said the sentence ""was severe by Russian legal standards and goes to prove what we have known all along, that Brittney is being used as a political pawn."" She added that she supported Biden's efforts ""to get a deal done."" A conviction is usually needed before arranging a prisoner exchange and also allows Griner to apply for a pardon. Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said last month the ""necessary judicial procedures"" must be completed before other steps can be taken. The disclosure in July that the U.S. government was seeking a prisoner swap involving Griner reflected the growing pressure on the Biden administration to do more to bring her home. The U.S. State Department had earlier declared Griner to be ""wrongfully detained"" - a charge that Russia has sharply rejected. When she took the stand July 7, Griner said: ""I would like to plead guilty on the charges against me. But I had no intention of breaking any Russian law."" She added that she brought the vape canisters into Russia because she had packed in haste for her flight. Griner also described a confusing scene while being held at the airport, saying an interpreter provided by authorities translated only a fraction of what was being said to her and that officials told her to sign documents without explaining what they were. She also said she was not informed of her rights. Her lawyers introduced evidence that Griner was using the medicinal cannabis for chronic pain and injuries sustained during her career and included a letter from her doctor. Griner testified she was aware cannabis oil was outlawed in Russia and had not intended to break the law or ""plan to smuggle anything into Russia."" Griner´s case and her nearly six months behind bars have raised strong criticism among her supporters in the United States, including her wife, Cherelle, that Biden was not doing enough to win her freedom. Griner sent a personal appeal to Biden, and more than 1,100 Black female leaders urged the administration to ""make a deal to get Brittney back home swiftly and safely and to meet with Brittney´s wife Cherelle immediately."" Biden later called Cherelle Griner ""to reassure her that he is working to secure Brittney´s release as soon as possible,"" the White House said July 6. Cherelle Griner, who also spoke with Vice President Kamala Harris, later said she was ""grateful to the both of them for the time they spent with me and for the commitment they expressed to getting BG home,"" using her wife´s initials. On July 27, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Washington has offered a deal to Russia aimed at bringing home Griner and Whelan in a sharp reversal of previous policy. Details of the proposal were not announced, though a person familiar with the matter said the U.S. has offered to trade convicted Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout for Whelan and Griner. The person insisted on anonymity to discuss an ongoing investigation. Russian media have speculated repeatedly that Griner could be swapped for Bout, nicknamed ""the Merchant of Death,"" who is serving a 25-year sentence in the U.S. after being convicted of conspiracy to kill U.S. citizens and providing aid to a terrorist organization. Russia has agitated for Bout´s release for years. The severity of Griner's sentence could give Russia leverage in a swap by increasing pressure on Washington to negotiate her release. ""I think that the harsher the sentence, the more pressure there will be on the Biden administration to make a deal, and obviously they like leveraging that pressure,"" Tom Firestone, a lawyer who formerly served as the resident legal adviser at the U.S. Embassy in Moscow, said of the Russians before the sentence was imposed. Even with U.S.-Russia relations at a low point, the two countries managed to arrange a swap in April of Trevor Reed, a former U.S. Marine detained in Russia, for Konstantin Yaroshenko, a Russian pilot and convicted drug trafficker serving a 20-year prison sentence in Connecticut. Griner's detention was made public only after Russian troops moved into Ukraine, as relations between Russia and the United States hit new lows after Washington led the West in bringing sanctions against Moscow. Her plight has been highlighted by supporters at home, including top athletes, especially after little news emerged about her initial weeks of detention in Russia, where she had limited access to U.S. diplomats. It was only in May that the State Department designated her as wrongfully detained, moving her case under its Special Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs, effectively the government´s chief hostage negotiator. At the ESPY Awards last month, soccer star Megan Rapinoe referred to Griner as ""a political prisoner,"" and tennis great Billie Jean King said, ""First, bring BG home. Gotta do that."" NBA Finals MVP Stephen Curry wore Griner´s jersey under his track suit at the awards show and urged ""the entire global sports community to continue to stay energized on her behalf."" Griner, a 6-foot-9 center, has 12 of the 15 regular season dunks in WNBA history and set the single-year record for blocks with 129 in 2014. She led the league in scoring twice. She was a two-time Associated Press college basketball player of the year and led Baylor to a 40-0 season and the 2012 NCAA title. She was the No. 1 pick by Phoenix in the 2013 draft. Her teammates watched Thursday's trial on television in a locker room in Connecticut, where they were to play an evening game. The game was to be preceded by a 42-second moment of silence - 42 is Griner´s number. The commissioners of the WNBA and NBA called the verdict ""unjustified and unfortunate, but not unexpected."" ___ Associated Press writers Eric Tucker in Washington and Doug Feinberg in New York contributed. -- Follow AP's coverage of the Brittney Griner case at https://apnews.com/hub/brittney-griner WNBA star and two-time Olympic gold medalist Brittney Griner is escorted from a court room ater a hearing, in Khimki just outside Moscow, Russia, Thursday, Aug. 4, 2022.

Wang's talks with top diplomats from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations were held amid high tensions in the region, following U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's visit to Taiwan, which has infuriated Beijing. The group issued a strong statement earlier in the day, urging both the U.S. and China to show ""maximum restraint"" in the wake of the visit and ""refrain from provocative action."" China claims the self-governing island of Taiwan as its territory and opposes any engagement by Taiwanese officials with foreign governments. In his opening remarks, Wang did not mention the situation but instead stressed how China and ASEAN countries have strengthened cooperation in recent years. ""We have safeguarded the oasis of peace in the face of the turbulence in the international security situation,"" he said. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi smiles before the start of ASEAN-China Ministerial Meeting in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, Thursday, Aug 4, 2022. (AP Photo/Heng Sinith) ASEAN is made up of Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam. China has become one of the biggest lenders to developing countries through its Belt and Road Initiative to expand trade by building ports, railways and other infrastructure across Asia, Africa and the Middle East to Europe. This has prompted accusations that Beijing is using debt to gain political leverage, but Chinese officials deny that. In the Phnom Penh meetings, Wang pledged that China will continue to ""strive to promote high-quality development, build a new development pattern, provide greater momentum for regional and world economic recovery and development, and provide more development opportunities for ASEAN countries."" Prime Minister Hun Sen of Cambodia, one of the group´s most pro-China countries and this year's host of the ASEAN meetings, met individually with Wang on Wednesday. During the meeting with Hun Sen, Wang reiterated that ""China is willing to work with Cambodia to safeguard their respective sovereignty, security and development interests,"" China´s state-run Xinhua news agency reported. The report did not provide more detail, but China and Cambodia in June broke ground on a naval port expansion project which has raised concerns from the U.S. and others that it could give Beijing a strategically important military outpost on the Gulf of Thailand. Hun Sen in 2019 reportedly granted China the right to set up a military base at the Ream Naval Base, but has long denied that, saying Cambodia´s Constitution prohibits foreign military facilities. The U.S. in November sanctioned two senior Cambodian defense officials over allegations of graft connected to construction financing at the Ream base, and China has accused Washington of conducting a smear campaign. In his meeting with Wang, Hun Sen said an ""iron-clad"" friendship had developed which was ""enjoying fruitful results from joint construction of the Belt and Road, which have brought huge benefits to their peoples,"" Xinhua reported. The U.S. has also been pushing strongly to increase its presence and involvement in the Asia-Pacific, and U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said ahead of his meetings with the ASEAN ministers that Washington hoped to increase cooperation with the group across the region. ""We strongly support the ASEAN outlook on the Indo-Pacific and we wholeheartedly endorse the values upon which the outlook is based,"" Blinken said. ""Openness, exclusivity, a commitment to the rule of law, good governance."" In a separate meeting with the ASEAN ministers that brought together Wang with South Korean Foreign Minister Park Jin and Japanese Foreign Minister Hayashi Yoshimasa, Yoshimasa emphasized that the Russian invasion of Ukraine has had far-reaching effects beyond Europe, which he said has made it even more difficult for economies to recover from the coronavirus pandemic. ""Russia's aggression against Ukraine has given rise to many challenges, including soaring prices of energy, food and other commodities, as well as supply chain disruptions,"" he said. ""I think now is the time to address these challenges in a coordinated manner, and it is even more important to maintain and strengthen the free and open international order based on the rule of law."" Addressing the ASEAN ministers ahead of a different meeting, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov made no specific mention of the Ukraine invasion or the resulting economic issues, saying only that there were currently ""challenges related to some of our colleagues imposing bloc approaches in the spirit of the Cold War."" In a one-on-one meeting with European Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell, however, Cambodia's Hun Sen said he had urged that sanctions against Russia be reconsidered because they were having serious economic effects on other nations around the world. He added in a post on his Facebook page that he had met with Lavrov and that they talked about the war in Ukraine, but did not provide further details. In a later post, he said he had also urged Blinken to reconsider the Russia sanctions. ___ Associated Press writer Sopheng Cheang contributed to this story.

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-11079805/Months-war-Ukraine-refugees-slow-join-EU-workforce.html,2022-08-04,"Months into war, Ukraine refugees slow to join EU workforce","Liudmyla Chudyjovych used to have a career as a lawyer in Ukraine and big plans for the future. That was before the Russian invasion forced the 41-year-old woman to put her daughter's safety first, and leave both her job and home behind. Since fleeing the town of Stryj in western Ukraine in May, Chudyjovych has found a new job in the Czech Republic. But instead of practicing law, she's had to settle for work as a housekeeper at a hotel in the capital, Prague. ""It´s just a different stage of my career,"" she said. ""That´s simply how it is."" One of the millions of refugees who have fled Ukraine since the Feb. 24 Russian invasion, Chudyjovych considers herself lucky to have a job at all. Not fluent enough in either Czech or English, Chudyjovych said she didn't mind the work as long as she and her daughter are safe. Although the European Union introduced regulations early in the war to make it easier for Ukrainian refugees to live and work in its 27 member nations while they decide whether to seek asylum or return home, many are only now starting to find jobs - and many are still struggling. Some 6.5 million Ukrainians, have entered the EU since February, according to Frontex, the EU Border and Coast Guard Agency, streaming into neighboring countries before many moved on to more prosperous nations in the West. Around half have since returned to Ukraine. Ukrainian refugee Liudmyla Chudyjovych makes up a room in a hotel where she works, Wednesday, Aug. 3, 2022, in Prague, Czech Republic. Nearly six months after the Russian invasion of Ukraine, many refugees are still struggling to find jobs in their European Union host countries, despite the EU's streamlined process for Ukrainians to live and work in any of its 27 member nations. (AP Photo/Petr David Josek) Only a relatively small number of those who stayed had entered the EU labor market by mid-June, according to the European Commission. A recent Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development report looking at the potential impact Ukrainian refugees will have on the EU workforce projected it will be about twice as large as the 2014-2017 inflow of refugees, which included many fleeing war in Syria. The study estimated the Czech Republic, which has the lowest unemployment rate in Europe, would add the most Ukrainians to its workforce by the end of the year, with an increase of 2.2%, followed by Poland and Estonia. About 1.2 million workers would be added to the European workforce overall, mainly in service occupations, the report said. Still, the influx is unlikely to drive down wages or boost unemployment in European countries, many of which face labor shortages due in part to their aging populations. ""Considering the labor needs of the main host countries, a negative impact in terms of employment or wages for the resident population ... seems very unlikely,"" the report concluded. The EU effort to help the Ukrainians has won praise from the U.N. Refugee Agency and other rights groups dealing with migration. But they also note a major difference in the treatment of people fleeing wars or poverty in the Middle East, Africa or Asia, who often have to wait years before overcoming the hurdles for acquiring residency papers or work permits. Still, there are many challenges ahead for Ukrainian refugees looking for work. In addition to language barriers, skilled workers from Ukraine often lack documentation to prove their professional credentials to get better-paid employment. Their diplomas may not be recognized in their host countries, meaning many have to take language and training courses before they can seek professional opportunities. Because men between the ages of 18 and 60 are banned from leaving Ukraine, many refugees are women with children, which can be an additional obstacle for trying to find work. Many women are still weighing their options and might decide to return home for the start of the school year in September, officials say, despite the war being far from over. In Poland, which has taken in about 1 million Ukrainian refugees, more than any other EU nation, just over a third have found work, according to the Polish minister of labor and social policy, Marlena Malag. Some have gotten jobs as nurses or Ukrainian language teachers in Polish schools, while others are working as housekeepers or waitresses. In Portugal, some of the country´s largest companies have special job recruitment programs for Ukrainians, while the Institute for Employment and Professional Training offers free Portuguese language classes. In Germany, about half of some 900,000 Ukrainian refugees have registered with the country´s employment agency, though no figures are available on how many have actually found jobs. The Mediendienst Integration group, which tracks migration in Germany, says about half have university degrees, but doesn´t specify how many have been able to work in their professional fields. Natalia Borysova was chief editor of a morning TV show in the western Ukrainian city of Lviv before fleeing with her daughters, 11 and 13, in March, and settling in the German city of Cologne. She applied for low-paying jobs such as housekeeping, but ultimately decided to turn them down to focus on learning German. ""I´m an optimist and I am sure that I will find a job after learning the language,"" the 41-year-old said via WhatsApp. ""Perhaps on a different level than in Ukraine, but in the same field. Now it just doesn´t make sense for me to work for the minimum wage."" Borysova, like other Ukrainian refugees, receives an allowance from the German government that helps the family pay for food and housing, but said she wants to return to work as soon as she masters German. Chudyjovych is among some 400,000 Ukrainians in the Czech Republic who have registered for special long-term visas that grant access to jobs, health care, education and other benefits. Nearly 80,000 have already found work, the government said. At the Background café in Prague's Old Town, 15 Ukrainian refugees work with the Czech staff as part of a project sponsored by the Mama Coffee chain. The refugees also receive free language classes and other programs. Lisa Himich, 22, from Kyiv, likes it and says ""it feels like home here."" For Chudyjovych, working as a housekeeper is far better than living in fear and under the constant sound of air raid sirens. ""I thought I would miss Ukraine and be homesick but that hasn´t happened at all,"" Chudyjovych said. ""It´s peaceful here and I feel like a human being."" ___ Gec reported from Belgrade, Serbia.

Linda Thomas-Greenfield said the long-planned trip is not part of global competition with either of America´s rivals, but it is part of a series of high-level U.S. engagements ""that aim to affirm and strengthen our partnerships and relationships with African leaders and peoples."" Her trip from Aug. 4-7 will be followed immediately by U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken´s visits to South Africa, Congo and Rwanda from Aug. 7-11. It also comes on the heels of Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov´s visit last week to Egypt, Ethiopia, Uganda and the Republic of Congo where he accused the U.S. and European countries of driving up food prices. China´s Foreign Minister Wang Yi began 2022 with a four-day visit to Eritrea, Kenya and the Comoros, keeping a 32-year tradition that the country´s top diplomat make his first trip of the year to Africa. ""We´re not catching up. They are catching up,"" Thomas-Greenfield said. ""We have been engaging with this continent for decades, and even my own career is very much evidence of that."" Thomas-Greenfield first went to Africa as a student in the 1970s, and in her career as a U.S. diplomat she rose to be assistant secretary of state for African affairs from 2013 to 2017. FILE - Linda Thomas-Greenfield, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, introduces U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken before a town hall at the U.S. Mission to the United Nations with members of staff on May 19, 2022, in New York.

(AP Photo/John Minchillo, Pool, File) She said high energy prices, climate change, COVID-19 and increasing conflict have pushed millions of Africans ""to the brink,"" and that Russian President Vladimir Putin´s invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24 has added to the crisis, ""especially since some countries in Africa once got up to 75% of their wheat from Russia and Ukraine."" The U.S. ambassador said the three countries she is visiting - Uganda first followed by Ghana and Cape Verde - all face serious food security situations because of the significant rise in the cost of food and energy. But she said Ghana has been a leader in dealing with it and she will be visiting a market, meeting farmers and going to a grain factory in the country ""to see how we can help them improve on their production."" In an interview and at a news conference ahead of her three-nation visit, Thomas-Greenfield said her trip happens to come on the heels of Lavrov´s visit. Refusing to call Russia´s invasion of Ukraine a war, Lavrov said: ""The situation in Ukraine did additionally negatively affect food markets, but not due to the Russian special operation, rather due to the absolutely inadequate reaction of the West, which announced sanctions."" Thomas-Greenfield countered: ""Russia is there to defend what they know they have to defend - that they took actions that are hurting Africans, and they´re trying to somehow defend their actions and blame somebody else for the impact that their actions are having on the African continent."" ""They can try to do that. But my question to them is, how are you helping Africans to address the food insecurity issue, not whom you´re blaming for the food insecurity issues,"" she said. ""We´re there to help Africans address those issues. Russia can deal with its own problems."" As for China, while its trade with Africa last year was dramatically higher than U.S. trade, Thomas-Greenfield said ""if you look at our figures, and how far back our engagement has been with the Africans, then we really are far above those numbers."" ""As you look at what China´s doing in Africa, you need to look at the debt trap that African countries, many of them, have faced because of those relationships with China,"" she said. China has become one of the biggest lenders to developing countries through its Belt and Road initiative to expand trade by building ports, railways and other infrastructure across Africa, Asia, the Middle East and Europe. Wang, China´s foreign minister, insisted during his visit to Kenya in January that there is no ""debt trap."" ""The so-called `debt trap´ in Africa is not a fact, but a malicious hype-up,"" he said.

It was a bold assumption for the Republican leader to make in the aftermath of the Trump era, when Donald Trump roused a neo-isolationist streak in the GOP, railing against the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and threatening at times to upend the decades-old alliance. But over several courses of fresh fish and schnapps, McConnell, long a proponent of NATO's expansion as a bulwark against Russian aggression, sought to leave the impression that the U.S. would most certainly welcome the new NATO members with open arms. Late Wednesday, the Senate did exactly that, as most Republicans joined Democrats in ratifying the accession of Finland and Sweden to the alliance, an overwhelming 95-1 vote. Other NATO countries also must approve the new members. ""What a big day,"" McConnell said during an interview with The Associated Press in his office ahead of the vote. McConnell said he had just finished a phone call with the Finnish president, Sauli Niinisto, whom he now considers something of a friend. The two were ""just talking about what we've sort of been through since we had dinner together,"" he said, noting ""this new and strengthened NATO and the way it´s pulled together sort of the, shall I say, the democratic world."" The Republican is not the leader of the Senate's majority, but its minority, yet he has played a pivotal role in joining forces with President Joe Biden and the Democrats to nudge GOP senators off the Trump-era foreign policy approach and ensure NATO ratification. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., discusses NATO expansion and other issues during an Associated Press interview in his office at the Capitol in Washington, Wednesday, Aug. 3, 2022. (AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite) It's a milestone for McConnell, who has championed the NATO alliance almost since he joined the Senate more than 35 years ago. That position put him at odds with Trump during his tenure in the White House. At the time, McConnell and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi famously invited NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg to deliver a speech to Congress on its 70th anniversary in direct response to Trump´s criticisms of NATO. ""That´s the role Sen. McConnell is trying to play,"" said Eric Edelman, a former U.S. ambassador to Finland and Turkey. ""It's an ongoing struggle,"" Edelman said. ""The whole fight over Ukraine has become a little bit of a microcosm, a microcosmic case, of the larger fight in the party over its future stand on foreign policy. And, you see, unfortunately, a lot of people who don´t see this as an important stake for the United States."" Speedy action in the typically slow moving Senate was no guarantee, particularly as Republicans are still sorting out their policies and politics after Trump´s presidency. The former president had awakened in the party, and many American voters, a newfound skepticism of the overseas alliance that lingers in the GOP at a time when Russian President Vladimir Putin´s invasion of Ukraine has drawn the U.S. and its European allies closer together. Privately, McConnell counseled his GOP senators ahead of the vote with the same arguments he makes in public - including the idea that part of being a leader is explaining complex choices to constituents, even if Americans may say they don´t like spending money or focusing attention abroad. ""The one thing I was concerned about, particularly at that point, was this sort of growing isolationist sentiment in the party, to some extent, given voice by President Trump,"" McConnell said in his office, steps off the Senate floor. He had reason to be worried: Just a few months earlier McConnell believed as many as 25 GOP senators, half his caucus, would oppose $40 billion in military and humanitarian aid to Ukraine as it battled Russia. In the end, 11 voted against the Ukraine aid package, which Trump criticized. Ahead of the NATO vote, McConnell said he sought to convey to senators that the U.S. leadership role in the world ""is not just important militarily, but commercially, as well, all of which is good for this country. This is not a charity we´re involved in here. This is for the benefit of America."" He added: ""The world is better served if somebody stands up to dictatorships like we have in Russia and China."" In the end, only one Republican, Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri, a potential 2024 presidential hopeful, voted against ratifying the NATO expansion, saying the U.S.'s attention would be better focused on China. Even longtime non-interventionist Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., did not oppose the vote, choosing instead to abstain. Paul said in a floor speech that after Putin's invasion of Ukraine, ""the world changed."" McConnell shrugged off Paul's vote, saying he and his fellow Kentuckian often have different foreign policy views. As for Hawley, the GOP leader said he ""couldn't disagree more"" but didn't try to change his colleague's vote. In the months after that March dinner with the Finnish president, McConnell led a delegation to visit Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Kyiv. The senators then stopped in Sweden and Finland in a show of support for the alliance. At a news conference in Stockholm, McConnell vowed that the Senate, which he did not control, would vote to ratify NATO membership by summer. Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., another potential presidential hopeful who joined the March dinner, said of the GOP leader: ""Sen. McConnell has been a strong proponent all summer long of not waiting around to get this done.""

In a rare statement on such issues from the 10-nation group, some of whose members drift more toward China in allegiance and some toward the United States, ASEAN foreign ministers meeting in Phnom Penh, Cambodia said Thursday that they were concerned the situation could ""destabilize the region and eventually could lead to miscalculation, serious confrontation, open conflicts and unpredictable consequences among major powers."" Both U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi were taking part in the ongoing ASEAN meetings in Phnom Penh on Thursday and Friday. Pelosi received a euphoric welcome as the first U.S. House speaker, and highest ranking U.S. official, to visit Taiwan in more than 25 years, and China swiftly responded by announcing multiple military exercises nearby. China claims the self-governing island of Taiwan as its territory and opposes any engagement by Taiwanese officials with foreign governments. Beijing has accused the U.S. of breaking the status quo with the Pelosi visit, while the U.S. insists there has been no change to its ""one-China"" position of recognizing the government in Beijing, while allowing for informal relations and defense ties with Taipei.

(AP Photo/Heng Sinith) On the other side, with China's recent increase in military activities around Taiwan, Washington accuses Beijing of no longer accepting the status quo. Shortly after Pelosi landed Tuesday night, China announced live-fire drills that reportedly started that night, as well as the four-day exercises starting Thursday. The People´s Liberation Army Air Force also flew a contingent of 21 warplanes toward Taiwan. Meantime, the U.S. has an aircraft carrier group and other naval assets in the region. In their statement, the ASEAN foreign ministers called for ""maximum restraint"" and for all sides to ""refrain from provocative action."" ""The world is in dire need of wisdom and responsibility of all leaders to uphold multilateralism and partnership, cooperation, peaceful-coexistence and healthy competition for our shared goals of peace, stability, security and inclusive and sustainable development,"" they said. ""We should act together and ASEAN stands ready to play a constructive role in facilitating peaceful dialogue between all parties including through utilizing ASEAN-led mechanisms to deescalate tension, to safeguard peace, security and development in our region.""

U.S. intelligence officials have determined that Russia is looking to plant false evidence to make it appear that Ukrainian forces were responsible for the July 29 attack on Olenivka Prison that left 53 dead and wounded dozens more, according to White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby Separately, a Western government official, who briefed reporters on the condition of anonymity, said explosive experts who have reviewed photos of the prison released by the Russians following the incident have determined that the destruction wasn´t likely caused by ""a high-explosive strike from the outside"" and that it was ""much more likely to be incendiary and from inside the location."" ""We anticipate that Russian officials will try to frame the Ukrainian Armed Forces in anticipation of journalists and potential investigators visiting the site of the attack,"" Kirby said. Russia has claimed that Ukraine´s military used U.S.-supplied rocket launchers to strike the prison in Olenivka, a settlement controlled by the Moscow-backed Donetsk People´s Republic. The Ukrainian military denied making any rocket or artillery strikes in Olenivka. The intelligence arm of the Ukrainian defense ministry claimed in a statement Wednesday to have evidence that local Kremlin-backed separatists colluded with the Russian FSB, the KGB´s main successor agency, and mercenary group Wagner to mine the barrack before ""using a flammable substance, which led to the rapid spread of fire in the room."" FILE - In this photo taken from video a view of a destroyed barrack at a prison in Olenivka, in an area controlled by Russian-backed separatist forces, eastern Ukraine, on July 29, 2022. Russia and Ukraine accused each other Friday of shelling a prison in a separatist region of eastern Ukraine, an attack that reportedly killed dozens of Ukrainian military prisoners who were captured after the fall of a southern port city of Mariupol in May. (AP Photo) Kirby said the classified intelligence determination - which was recently downgraded - shows that Russian officials might even plant ammunition from medium-ranged High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems, or HIMARS, as evidence that the systems provided by the U.S. to Ukraine were used in the attack. Ukraine has effectively used HIMARS launchers, which fire medium-range rockets and can be quickly moved before Russia can target them with return fire, and have been seeking more launchers from the United States. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov on Thursday angrily dismissed the U.S. officials´ claims about Russia fabricating the evidence. ""It has been absolutely proven and it´s absolutely obvious what happened in Olenivka,"" Peskov said Thursday in a conference call with reporters. ""Ukrainian prisoners of war were killed by the Ukrainian military. Ukraine killed its soldiers who were in captivity, and many others were wounded. There is an evidence and there is nothing to hide."" United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said Wednesday he is appointing a fact-finding mission in response to requests from Russia and Ukraine to investigate the killings at the prison. Guterres told reporters he doesn´t have authority to conduct criminal investigations but does have authority to conduct fact-finding missions. He added that the terms of reference for a mission to Ukraine are currently being prepared and will be sent to the governments of Ukraine and Russia for approval. Peskov said that Russia has invited the U.N. and the Red Cross to visit the site and conduct a probe. The Ukrainian POWs at the Donetsk prison included troops captured during the fall of Mariupol. They spent months holed up with civilians at the giant Azovstal steel mill in the southern port city. Their resistance during a relentless Russian bombardment became a symbol of Ukrainian defiance against Russia´s aggression. More than 2,400 soldiers from the Azov Regiment of the Ukrainian national guard and other military units gave up their fight and surrendered under orders from Ukraine´s military in May. Scores of Ukrainian soldiers have been taken to prisons in Russian-controlled areas. Some have returned to Ukraine as part of prisoner exchanges with Russia, but other families have no idea whether their loved ones are still alive, or if they will ever come home. U.S. and U.K. officials, before the war and in its early stages, repeatedly went public with what they said were Russian plans to stage fake videos and events that the Kremlin would blame on Ukraine but in fact were perpetrated by Russia. - Lederer reported from the United Nations.

He made clear he would not announce profound measures that would immediately change the course of an economy that is suffering from galloping inflation, a shortage of Central Bank foreign currency reserves and a sharp depreciation of Argentina's peso. ""I´m not super anything, nor a magician nor a savior,"" Massa said during a news conference Wednesday night at which he sketched his main plans. When Massa was first unveiled as the latest economy minister, many were quick to dub him a ""super minister"" because his position would involve running three previously independent ministries - economy, production and agriculture. ""This team has the obligation to give answers that will not come in a day nor two,"" he said. ""Magic doesn´t exist."" Massa, who resigned as head of Congress´ lower house, the Chamber of Deputies, to take on the Cabinet post brings political heft to a role that had become a hot potato amid Argentina´s economic woes and increasingly splintered governing coalition. Argentina's newest Economy Minister Sergio Massa speaks during a press conference in Buenos Aires, Argentina, Wednesday, Aug. 3, 2022. Massa will lead a new ministry that combines the current Economy, Productive Development, and Agriculture ministries. (AP Photo/Natacha Pisarenko) He expressed determination to maintain the goal of keeping the government's deficit at 2.5% of Gross Domestic Product, which was part of the commitment the country made with the International Monetary Fund to restructure $44 billion in Argentine debt. Left-leaning members of the governing coalition, including Vice President Cristina Fernández, a former president herself, have been highly critical of the agreement with the IMF, arguing it requires too much austerity and will hamper Argentina´s ability to grow. Massa made clear he has no plans to tear up the agreement, which was shepherded by then Economy Minister Martín Guzmán, a moderate who resigned in early July, saying he wasn´t getting political support from the governing coalition. Left-leaning Silvina Batakis was tapped to take over the role but lasted less than a month. In an effort to combat inflation that is running at more than 60% annually and is expected to sharply increase in the next few months, Massa said he would no longer use the Central Bank to finance government operations. ""We will make do with the resources that we collect via taxes and with the financing that we can obtain from the private sector,"" he said. He also said he would continue, and expand, an effort to slash energy subsidies by increasing electricity and gas rates, which was a key demand from the IMF. Argentina is spending billions of dollars to import energy amid higher global prices following Russia´s invasion of Ukraine and pandemic disruptions. Without going into details, Massa said he would grant special benefits to the agriculture, fishing and mining sectors in an effort to increase exports and thus boost hard currency reserves at the Central Bank. He said he has no plans to usher in a devaluation along with stringent capital controls amid the sharp depreciation of Argentina's currency in recent weeks, ""I want to say this clearly: Depreciation shocks only produce poverty and an enormous transfer of resources,"" he said. President Alberto Fernández billed Massa's appointment as a relaunching of the troubled government. ""We have a great opportunity as a country. Let´s not let it pass us by,"" Fernández said. Massa, a powerful former mayor who has long been a presidential hopeful, is seen as a pro-market moderate who has strong political influence and good relations with the country´s business elite. He was Cabinet chief for almost one year during the first term of Cristina Fernández´s 2007-2015 presidency but then went on to become critical of her as he pursued his own presidential ambitions. Massa will have to play a delicate balancing act by calming markets that are skeptical of Argentina while also dealing with social demands in a country where nearly four of every 10 people are poor and there are growing protests calling for more welfare.

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-11078489/WH-says-falling-gas-prices-matter-OPEC-numbers.html,2022-08-03,White House: Falling gas prices mean more than OPEC numbers,"President Joe Biden traveled to Saudi Arabia last month on the possibility that he could get some additional oil production out of OPEC+ in coming weeks, but the cartel and other nations announced a scant increase Wednesday. The White House responded by stressing that what matters is the steady decline in oil and gasoline prices from summer highs, not the actions taken by OPEC+ to pump an additional 100,000 barrels of oil in September. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre noted that the decline began June 14, the day the administration disclosed plans for Biden's trip to Israel and Saudi Arabia. ""The fact of the matter is that oil and gas prices are coming down,"" Jean-Pierre told reporters at her briefing. ""The moment he announced his trip we saw gas prices and oil prices coming down."" While there may be a correlation, it is unclear whether the announced trip caused prices to decline. Oil prices can be determined by a wide range of factors including changes in supply, the pace of economic growth, geopolitical events and extreme weather. Behind Jean-Pierre in the briefing room was a blue chart that showed a 17% drop in average U.S. gas costs since prices peaked at about $5 a gallon. AAA puts the current national average at $4.16 a gallon. Crude oil prices fell Wednesday to just below $91 a barrel, down from more than $120 in early June. Still, gas prices are 31% above their level last year, frustrating voters ahead of the midterm elections and heightening concerns about an economic downturn in the U.S. and Europe as central banks try to get inflation under control. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre speaks during a briefing at the White House, Wednesday, Aug. 3, 2022, in Washington. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci) Energy prices jumped after Russia, a major energy producer, invaded Ukraine in late February. That prompted a series of sanctions and other measures at a time when refining capacity was tight and oil production was still recovering from the pandemic that began in 2020. The Biden administration has called on OPEC+ as well as domestic producers and refineries to increase output, an effort the administration tried to bridge by releasing 1 million barrels daily from the U.S. strategic reserve. The war in Ukraine quickly rejiggered global politics. Natural gas shortages threatened Europe and Biden's approval ratings sank as prices at the pump climbed. Biden's Saudi Arabia trip was something of an about-face, given that at a 2019 debate during the presidential campaign, Biden had called the kingdom a ""pariah"" for the killing of Washington Post contributor Jamal Khashoggi. Yet after Biden met with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in mid-July, Biden raised expectations that a meaningful amount of supply could be coming onto the market. Asked about the impact his meeting would have on oil prices, he said ""you won´t see that for another couple of weeks"" in what appeared to be a reference to Wednesday's meeting of the OPEC oil cartel. In a world that uses nearly 100 million barrels of oil daily, the added production amounted to a miniscule 0.1% increase. In a prior meeting, OPEC had boosted oil production by 648,000 barrels per day in July and August. But in a statement, OPEC+ warned about the reasons why it was being cautious in adding oil to the market. The countries in the cartel, which is led by Saudi Arabia, needed to keep some of their oil capacity in reserve in case of future disruptions. They also noted the ""chronic"" lack of investment in oil production that has coincided with wealthier nations' shift away from fossil fuels to address climate change. Biden is trying to reduce the U.S. reliance on fossil fuels. Democratic allies are working to push through the Senate a measure that includes $369 billion in climate change-fighting strategies over the next decade. That spending would include tax breaks for wind and solar as well as for purchasing electric vehicles.

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-11077915/Germanys-Scholz-says-nuclear-extension-make-sense.html,2022-08-03,Germany's Scholz says nuclear extension 'could make sense',"Chancellor Olaf Scholz said Wednesday that extending the life of Germany's three remaining nuclear reactors beyond the end of the year ""could make sense,"" but he didn't commit to the idea. Opposition leaders and the pro-business Free Democrats, the smallest party in Scholz's coalition government, have increasingly advocated a rethink of the long-standing decision to switch off Germany's last reactors in December as worries mount about the impact of a much-reduced supply of Russian gas. The idea of an extension is awkward for Scholz's Social Democrats and, particularly, for the third party in the government, the environmentalist Greens. A Social Democrat-Green government launched the nuclear shutdown two decades ago, and opposition to nuclear power is central to the Greens' identity. The German government is awaiting the results of a new ""stress test"" on the security of the country´s electricity supply. The Economy Ministry in mid-July announced a test that would factor in a tougher scenario than a previous test, which found the country's supply assured. Results are expected in the coming weeks. Some Greens recently indicated a degree of openness to allowing one or more reactors to keep running for a short period with their existing fuel rods, if the country faces a power supply emergency. Officials from the party have stressed that gas is a factor primarily in powering industry and heating homes, more than generating electricity, and nuclear power wouldn't help with that. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, right, stands besides Christian Bruch, CEO of Siemens Energy, at the turbine serviced in Canada for the Nordstream 1 natural gas pipeline in Muelheim an der Ruhr, Germany, Aug. 3, 2022. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz visited a plant by Siemens Energy where a turbine, which is at the center of a dispute between Germany and Russia over reduced gas supplies, is currently sitting in storage until it can be shipped to Russia. (Bernd Thissen/dpa via AP) Asked Wednesday about the prospects for potentially keeping the reactors online, Scholz said ""the last three nuclear power plants are relevant exclusively for electricity production, and only for a small part of that."" ""But nevertheless, it could make sense,"" he added, noting that regions of Germany vary in the degree to which they have developed renewable energy sources. The chancellor cited the ongoing ""stress test"" and didn't elaborate on what exactly might be acceptable. In this year´s first quarter, nuclear plants accounted for 6% of Germany´s electricity generation and gas for 13%. ___ Follow AP's coverage of the Russia-Ukraine war at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine"

The claim comes just days before the tiny cash-strapped country receives Ukraine´s first grain shipment since Russia´s invasion began over five months ago. The Syrian-flagged Laodicea has been anchored at the port of Tripoli since it arrived last Thursday, carrying 10,000 tons of wheat flour and barley. Ukraine says the grain was stolen by Russia. Ukrainian Ambassador to Lebanon Ihor Ostash urged Lebanon not to allow the vessel to leave the port. The U.S. Treasury Department sanctioned the ship in 2015 for its affiliation with the Syrian government of President Bashar Assad, a close political and military ally to Moscow. A senior Lebanese customs official said Friday that Ukraine´s claims that the ship contained stolen goods were untrue and that the vessel's papers appeared in order following an inspection. A boat with Russian, Ukrainian, Turkish and U.N. officials heads to the Sierra Leone-flagged cargo ship Razoni, to check if the grain shipment is in accordance with a crucial agreement signed last month by Moscow and Kyiv, at an inspection area in the Black Sea off the coast of Istanbul, Turkey, Wednesday, Aug. 3, 2022. The cargo ship Razoni, loaded up with 26,000 tons of corn, set sail from Ukraine's Odesa on Monday, enroute to final destination, Lebanon. (AP Photo/Emrah Gurel) Lebanon, already in the throes of a crippling economic and political crisis, has found itself entangled in the fallout from Russia´s war in Ukraine. A judge on Monday ordered the Laodicea not to set sail for 72 hours, following a request from Kyiv. However, Lebanon´s prosecutor general the following day decided the ship could set sail. The judge on Wednesday then ordered the ship released following the prosecutor's decision, judicial officials said on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the media. It was not immediately clear if the ship would sail from Tripoli on Thursday. The Laodicea is now free to go but that will likely anger Ukraine. Russia´s diplomatic mission in Lebanon praised the move, accusing Ukraine of lying about the cargo and trying to damage relations between Moscow and Beirut. Ostash at a news conference Wednesday presented documents and mapping of the Laodicea´s journey and cargo. He said that evidence from Kyiv´s security agencies and judiciary indicates the vessel contained stolen goods. ""Of course it´s important to understand that we would like to go via legal procedures to ... provide all possible evidences and proofs of the Ukrainian side,"" Ostash said. He presented a photo of what appears to be the Laodicea being loaded with the cargo in the Russia-annexed Crimea peninsula. The ongoing fuss over the Laodicea comes as the first grain ship carrying 26,000 tons of Ukrainian corn aboard the Sierra Leone-flagged Razoni entered Turkey´s Bosporus Strait en route to the Tripoli port in Lebanon. It´s the first grain ship heading from the war-torn country since Russia´s invasion in late February. A Lebanese official told The Associated Press on Wednesday that the ship is expected to take about four days to arrive in Lebanon from Istanbul after it was searched. After presenting Kyiv´s latest evidence about the Laodicea, Ostash turned to the Razoni, which he said unlike the Syrian ship carried ""in a legal way, not stolen, original Ukrainian grain."" Lebanon condemned Russia´s invasion of Ukraine in February, which angered Moscow and its allies in Beirut. Ostash praised Lebanon again for taking this position. The shipments come at a time when Lebanon is suffering from a food security crisis, with soaring food inflation, wheat shortages and breadlines. Three-quarters of its population lives in poverty.

Lawyer Dmitry Kravchenko said Zuyev gave testimony helping investigation and paid more than 15 million rubles (about $250,000) in damages, according to Interfax.

The 395-to-112 vote came after a heated debate at the National Assembly, where French President Emmanuel Macron no longer has a majority. The Senate also approved the text on Wednesday evening. The bill was a key promise from Macron, who was reelected for a second term in April. It was also a crucial test of the government´s ability to govern - and opposition forces´ ability to weigh in on the lawmaking process. Macron´s centrist alliance won the most seats at the National Assembly in June but lost its absolute majority as a leftist coalition and the far right both made big gains, becoming strong opposition forces. Annual inflation has reached a record 8.6% for the 19 countries using the shared euro currency, swollen by a huge increase in food and energy costs fueled partly by the war in Ukraine. In France, annual inflation is estimated to be running at 6.5%. ""Your purchasing power is our priority,"" French government spokesperson Olivier Veran tweeted. ""To protect you from inflation, we maintained the price cap on gas and electricity and set a price cap to limit rent increases to 3.5%."" The National Assembly is pictured as French Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne delivers a speech in Paris, France, Wednesday, July 6, 2022. Borne lay out her main priorities at parliament after the government lost its straight majority in the National Assembly in elections last month. (AP Photo/Christophe Ena) The bill also includes increasing pensions and some welfare payments by 4%. On fuel, a current state-financed rebate of 18 cents per liter will be increased to 30 cents in September and October. Private companies are also being encouraged to offer employees an annual tax-free bonus of up to 6,000 euros ($6,080). The text was backed by members of Macron´s centrist alliance, the conservative The Republicans party and the far-right National Rally. It has been debated at parliament alongside an updated version of the budget law, which is to be voted on later this week. The leftist Nupes coalition - the largest opposition force, composed of the far-left, Communists, Socialists and the Greens - criticized the measures as not going far enough and widely voted against the bill on Wednesday. Aurélie Trouvé, from the far-left France Unbowed party, said ""nothing is up to the inflation´s level... The project is actually putting into law the decline of the purchasing power."" Heated discussions at the National Assembly led the debate to be extended to evenings and weekends, with lawmakers from Macron's alliance sometimes needing to sprint into the chamber to stop opposition amendments from passing. ""We are living one of the most serious energy crisis, which represents about 60% of the current inflation,"" Minister for Energy Transition Agnès Pannier-Runacher said. She said the bill provides measures to boost France´s energy production and supplies, including possibly requisitioning gas-powered electricity plants if gas supplies were threatened. Another measure plans to install a floating terminal in the western port of Le Havre to be able to import more liquified natural gas, which comes by ship from places like the U.S. and Qatar. Recent weeks of debates at the National Assembly contrasted with previous years, when Macron used to have a wide majority allowing him to almost automatically pass measures. The parliamentary session is ending this week for both houses of parliament, the National Assembly and the Senate. French lawmakers will start debating again in October. ___ Follow all AP stories on the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine."

The Kremlin insisted more assurances were needed. Russian energy giant Gazprom last week halved the amount of natural gas flowing through the Nord Stream 1 pipeline to 20% of capacity, the latest reduction it blamed on delays to the turbine's delivery due to Western sanctions. German partner Siemens Energy sent the turbine to Canada for overhaul, which was a routine process before Russia invaded Ukraine and was subjected to Western sanctions. The German government says the turbine was meant to be installed in September and wasn't needed to make the pipeline function now; it says Moscow is using spurious technical explanations as cover for a political move to create uncertainty and to push up gas prices. The turbine is now stored at a Siemens Energy facility in Mulheim an der Ruhr, in western Germany.

German Chancellor Olaf Scholz visited a plant by Siemens Energy where a turbine, which is at the center of a dispute between Germany and Russia over reduced gas supplies, is currently sitting in storage until it can be shipped to Russia. (Bernd Thissen/dpa via AP) ""This turbine is usable any time,"" Scholz said, standing next to the 18-ton piece of machinery. ""There is nothing standing in the way of its transport on to Russia - other than that the Russian recipients have to say that they want to have the turbine, and give the necessary information for the customs transport to Russia."" ""All other permits are there - that goes for the permit from Germany, the permit from the European Union, from the United Kingdom, from Canada,"" the chancellor added. ""There are no problems."" Gazprom´s repeated reductions of gas deliveries to various countries have raised fears that Russia may cut off supplies altogether to try to gain political leverage over Europe. German officials say Gazprom needs to specify where exactly the turbine needs to be sent. Scholz said he was checking out the turbine publicly to ""demystify"" it. The chancellor reiterated Germany's insistence that ""there are no technical reasons for the reduction of gas deliveries through Nord Stream 1."" He said sanctions don't apply to the gas used to power industry, heat homes and generate electricity. Gazprom has repeatedly said it pressed Siemens Energy for documents and clarification. The company specifically wants documents from Siemens Energy proving that the turbine isn't subject to Western sanctions, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said. ""We need to be sure that it´s not under sanctions. We need to be sure that Siemens´ British subsidiary in charge of it won´t switch it off remotely in the future as part of sanctions,"" Peskov told reporters during a conference call. Peskov said former German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder asked Russian President Vladimir Putin during a recent meeting in Moscow if the completed but not-yet-functioning Nord Stream 2 pipeline could be put into service in an emergency to meet Europe's energy needs. Scholz´s government suspended the certification process for the new pipeline in February just before the invasion of Ukraine. Putin said Nord Stream 2 could start operating but only at half-capacity because Gazprom is now using the other half for Russia's domestic market, Peskov said. Schroeder´s longstanding ties to the Russian energy sector - including the Nord Stream 1 and 2 pipelines - and refusal to distance himself personally from Putin after the invasion of Ukraine have left his political standing at home in tatters. In an interview with Stern magazine and RTL television that appeared Wednesday, Schroeder argued that using Nord Stream 2 would be the ""simplest solution"" in case of gas shortages. Turning to Nord Stream 2 is a political non-starter for Scholz, who said that ""we ended the approval process for good reason."" He added that ""there is enough capacity in Nord Stream 1,"" and that two other pipelines - one running through Ukraine and another through Belarus and Poland - are also available. ___ Kirsten Grieshaber in Berlin contributed to this report. ___ Follow AP's coverage of the Russia-Ukraine war at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, right, stands besides Christian Bruch, CEO of Siemens Energy, at the turbine serviced in Canada for the Nordstream 1 natural gas pipeline in Muelheim an der Ruhr, Germany, Aug. 3, 2022.

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-11076487/OPEC-decide-oil-output-world-amid-high-inflation.html,2022-08-03,OPEC+ boosts oil output by slower pace than previous months,"The OPEC oil cartel and its allies decided Wednesday to boost production in September by a much slower pace than in previous months at a time of high gasoline prices and unstable energy supplies exacerbated by Russia's war in Ukraine. OPEC, led by Saudi Arabia, and its allies, led by Russia, said they will increase output to 100,000 barrels a day next month after raising it by 648,000 barrels per day in July and August. The group considered what effects staggering inflation and rising COVID-19 rates may have on global demand for fuel in the fall. It comes after U.S. President Joe Biden visited Saudi Arabia last month, aiming to improve relations and encourage more oil production from the cartel to draw down high prices at the pump. While gasoline prices have been falling, they are still high and posing a political problem for him as inflation surges. No oil production agreement was announced, but Biden said he expected OPEC to take steps to increase production in the coming weeks. Those hopes didn't materialize. As a result, ""the U.S. may go looking for other sources of oil, whether it´s Venezuela or Iran,"" said Jacques Rousseau, managing director at Clearview Energy Partners. Biden's administration also is encouraging the U.S. oil and gas industry to increase production. FILE - The logo of the Organization of the Petroleoum Exporting Countries (OPEC) is seen outside of OPEC's headquarters in Vienna, Austria, Thursday, March 3, 2022. The OPEC oil cartel and its allies are meeting on Wednesday, Aug. 3, 2022, to decide how much oil to produce in September. They're meeting amid high oil prices and unstable energy supplies exacerbated by the war Russia is waging on Ukraine. (AP Photo/Lisa Leutner, file) ""You´ve just seen the second-quarter results from some of these companies. They are record profits,"" Amos Hochstein, a senior adviser for energy security at the State Department, said Wednesday on CNBC. ""They should be investing those dollars right back into production increases."" Despite the modest increase announced by OPEC+, the administration was trying to highlight that prices are already falling and could fall further with more domestic production. ""We´re pretty pleased with what we´re seeing"" on prices for oil and gas down from highs, but ""we know that this is not enough,"" Hochstein said. A senior Biden administration official, who insisted on anonymity to discuss private conversations, called the OPEC+ announcement a step forward. The official said the group has restored all the production cuts it made in 2020 during the depths of the pandemic, when oil prices and demand plummeted. The group has been gradually adding more oil and gas to the market as economies recovered. Some OPEC nations, such as Angola and Nigeria, have been producing less than the agreed-upon amount. Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates, on the other hand, have the capacity to increase production. OPEC's decision appears to be an attempt to appease those countries that can't produce more, Rousseau said. ""Any time you increase the target, there´s countries that can´t participate,"" he added. ""If you only raise production by 100,000 barrels per day, that´s just a small piece for everybody."" As a result, the amount of oil on the market might not keep up with demand, so high oil prices may persist for some time. While the U.S. was probably hoping for a larger production increase, ""in terms of overall supply/demand management, OPEC´s decision is logical,"" Noah Barrett, research analyst for energy and utilities at Janus Henderson Investors, said in a note. ""There´s still a great deal of uncertainty on oil demand in the back half of this year, driven by questions around Chinese demand, and the potential for U.S. or even a global recession."" The price of oil rose sharply after Russia invaded Ukraine in February. It fell somewhat since OPEC+ last met but rose modestly Wednesday. A barrel of U.S. benchmark crude was selling for just over $94, compared with more than $105 per barrel a month ago. Brent crude, the international standard, was selling for just over $100 a barrel, also down about $110 from a month ago. Russia's oil and natural gas exports to the world have declined as many nations imposed sanctions or curtailed buying from the major supplier due to its invasion of Ukraine. Russia also has reduced or cut off natural gas to a dozen European countries, further driving up energy prices, squeezing people's spending power and threatening to cause a recession if nations can't stockpile enough natural gas to get through the winter. It was the first official monthly meeting of the OPEC+ group since its leader, Mohammad Sanusi Barkindo, died at age 63 in his home country of Nigeria last month. Haitham al-Ghais, a veteran of the Kuwait Petroleum Corporation, took over as secretary general of OPEC this week. In the U.S., a gallon of regular gasoline was selling for $4.16 on average Wednesday. That´s substantially lower than in June, when the nationwide average surpassed $5 a gallon, but it´s still painfully high for many front-line workers and families to afford and about 31% higher than what drivers were paying a year ago. ___ Associated Press writers Josh Boak and Zeke Miller in Washington contributed to this report."

Kenya´s Aug. 9 election is ripping open the scars of inequality and corruption as East Africa´s economic hub chooses a successor to President Uhuru Kenyatta. The vastly rich son of the country's founding leader, Kenyatta has deflected graft allegations by calling for transparency but done little in a decade in power to enable it. The vendors on a barren patch along Nairobi´s Outer Ring Road can hardly grasp the enormous amounts of money spent on next week's election. Few can. In Kenya, candidates aren´t required to publicly account for campaign donations or spending. But voters have watched the helicopters and long convoys that have whisked top candidates around the country for months. ""They´re spending millions of dollars, but I´m not sure if it´s their own money or the public´s money,"" said Martin Wambua, who sells secondhand clothes and rarely is able to save anything from his earnings. ""I know the (election spending) can fund more than 10 people a day,"" estimated Joseph Kaguthi, who walks everywhere selling baked goods and says he often eats just one daily meal. ""But I´m a poor man, and maybe the way I talk is distant from the way it is."" Rising prices for food and fuel, exacerbated by Russia´s invasion of Ukraine and following the economic pain of the COVID-19 pandemic, add to the traditional ethnic tensions in a vote called so closely contested that Kenya might go to a runoff election for the first time. A man pushes a bicycle past campaign posters for Kenyan presidential candidate Raila Odinga, referred to affectionately as ""Baba"", the Swahili word for ""father"", and his running mate Martha Karua, in the low-income Kibera neighborhood of Nairobi, Kenya Friday, July 29, 2022. Kenya's Aug. 9 election is ripping open the scars of inequality and corruption as East Africa's economic hub chooses a successor to President Uhuru Kenyatta. (AP Photo/Brian Inganga) How the country of 56 million people will cope with extended uncertainty is a major question given a recent history of turbulent elections. The vote ""will be an opportunity for Kenya to showcase its democracy to the world,"" U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Wednesday, arguing for ""a peaceful and transparent democratic process."" Kenya's 2017 vote saw results overturned by the courts, a first in Africa. Longtime opposition contender Raila Odinga boycotted the ordered re-vote and declared himself the ""people´s president"" in a mock swearing-in that led to allegations of treason. The standoff ended when Kenyatta and Odinga, the son of Kenya´s first vice president, shared a public handshake. Now, in the latest twist of Kenya´s shifting alliances, Kenyatta is backing former rival Odinga to succeed him after falling out with his deputy president, 55-year-old William Ruto, the other main presidential candidate and a former Odinga ally. Ruto was indicted by the International Criminal Court for crimes against humanity for his role in violence following the 2007 election that killed more than 1,000 people after Odinga alleged he had been cheated out of victory. An ICC indictment is hardly a bar to the presidency; Kenyatta was indicted over the turmoil, too. Both men saw their cases terminated amid allegations of witness tampering. Said to be one of Kenya´s richest men after a decade as deputy president, Ruto promotes himself to the young and poor as a ""hustler"" who rose from humble beginnings as a chicken seller in contrast to the elite backgrounds of Kenyatta and Odinga. He says he seeks greater agricultural productivity and financial inclusion. Agriculture is a main driver of Kenya´s economy and about 70% of the rural workforce is in farming, while informal street vendors make up the majority of non-farm work. ""Our economic system is rigged against small people,"" Ruto said in a campaign video. The video came out as a court ordered his wealthy running mate, Rigathi Gachagua, to repay to the state about $1.6 million that was determined to be the proceeds of corruption. Ruto has said he would accept the election's outcome ""whichever way it goes."" The 77-year-old Odinga, making his fifth and likely final try to win the presidency, is campaigning closely with running mate Martha Karua, a former justice minister who could become Kenya's first female deputy president. Karua has caught the attention of women in a country that fails to meet a gender quota for elective bodies like Parliament and where female candidates commonly face harassment. Odinga, famous for being jailed while fighting for multi-party democracy decades ago, has promised cash handouts to Kenya´s poorest while saying ""the middle class, of course, know how to look after themselves."" He has said he´ll accept election results ""as long as they´re free and fair."" When asked how much they were spending on the election, an Odinga spokesman told The Associated Press they will conduct a financial audit to find out at the end of the campaign. A spokesman for Ruto didn't respond. Ruto and Odinga say they´ll fight corruption, but non-governmental organizations sigh over Kenya´s failure to address the graft that eats away at everyday lives. The vendors on Nairobi's Outer Ring Road described having to bribe hospitals for timely treatment and the city´s notorious inspection officers to avoid alleged petty offenses. Corruption is said to be widespread among those running for office. Interior Minister Fred Matiangi has described Parliament candidates handing out as little as 100 shillings (84 cents) to win votes in villages. The underfunded Independent and Electoral Boundaries Commission, which sought to cap presidential campaign spending at 4.4 billion shillings ($36 million), has accused some politicians of buying people's identification cards to keep them from voting for rivals. ""Out of the 214 persons blacklisted by the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission as morally and ethically unfit to hold public office, the (electoral commission) barred only six individuals,"" Transparency International Kenya and other watchdogs said in June. For the rest, ""the commission seems to have thrown their hands in the air."" Kenyans want a peaceful election with results accepted by all sides. ""If we fight, it will basically backfire more on us than on them,"" said Andrew Atonya, part of a production company that staged a play in Nairobi asking voters to avoid falling prey to election divisions. ""They abuse each other,"" he said of candidates, ""but behind the curtain, they´re friends.""

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-11075927/Ship-Ukrainian-corn-anchored-Turkey-inspection.html,2022-08-03,Inspectors OK 1st Ukraine grain ship but no sign yet of more,"The first grain ship to leave Ukraine and cross the Black Sea under a wartime deal passed inspection Wednesday in Istanbul and headed on to Lebanon. Ukraine said 17 other vessels were ""loaded and waiting permission to leave,"" but there was no word yet on when they could depart. A joint civilian inspection team spent three hours checking the cargo and crew of the Sierra Leone-flagged ship Razoni, which left Odesa on Monday carrying Ukrainian corn, a U.N. statement said. The Joint Coordination Center team included officials from Ukraine, Russia, Turkey and the United Nations, who signed deals last month to create safe Black Sea shipping corridors to export Ukraine's desperately needed agricultural products as Russia's war upon its neighbor grinds on. Ukraine is a major global grain supplier but the war had blocked most exports, so the July 22 deal aimed to ease food security around the globe. World food prices have been soaring in a crisis blamed on the war, supply chain problems and COVID-19. Although U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken called Razoni's journey a ""significant step,"" no other ships have left from Ukraine in the past 48 hours and no explanations have been given for that delay. A U.N. statement said inspectors ""gained valuable information"" from the Razoni's crew about its voyage through the Black Sea maritime humanitarian corridor and the coordination center was ""fine-tuning procedures."" The Sierra Leone-flagged cargo ship Razoni sails under Yavuz Sultan Selim Bridge after being inspected by Russian, Ukrainian, Turkish and U.N. officials at the entrance of the Bosphorus Strait in Istanbul, Turkey, Wednesday, Aug. 3, 2022. Razoni, loaded up with 26,000 tons of corn, is the first cargo ship to leave Ukraine since the Russian invasion, and set sail from Odesa on Monday, August 1, 2022. Its final destination is Lebanon. (AP Photo/Emrah Gurel) The Turkish Ministry of National Defense tweeted a picture of an inspector reaching into the Razoni's hold and touching some of its 26,527 tons of corn for chicken feed. The Razoni´s horn rang out as the inspectors left the ship, and then it headed off to Lebanon. The checks seek to ensure that outbound cargo ships carry only grain, fertilizer or food and not any other commodities, and that inbound ships are not carrying weapons. An estimated 20 million tons of grain - most of it said to be destined for livestock - has been stuck in Ukraine since the start of the 6-month-old war. Ukraine´s top diplomat said Wednesday that more ships are ready to carry much-needed grain and food out of the country´s Black Sea ports. ""Further ships are already ready for departure. They will depart from the ports that are part of the grain initiative in accordance with the agreed schedule, and we hope that everything will work out and the Russian Federation will not take any steps that would destroy these agreements,"" Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said at a joint press conference in Kyiv with his Estonian counterpart. Kuleba said the U.N.-backed deal ""is beneficial to Ukrainian farmers, it is beneficial to the Ukrainian economy, and it is beneficial to the world."" "" It is now Ukraine that is, literally, saving the world from further growth in food prices and from hunger in individual countries,"" he said. Still, a Black Sea voyage entails significant risks because of the war. Two civilian ships hit explosive devices there last week near the Danube River´s Bystre estuary, according to Bridget Diakun, a data reporter at Lloyd´s List, a global shipping publication. Analysts say authorities' first priority is bringing out vessels that have been stuck for months at the three Ukrainian ports covered by the deal. Sixteen ships loaded with grain have been stuck at the ports of Odesa and Chernomorsk since Russia's invasion, according to Lloyd´s List. The U.N. official who helped negotiate the Russian deal with the U.N. aimed at ensuring unrestricted access to world markets for the country´s food and fertilizer says there are still obstacles to overcome. U.N. trade chief Rebeca Grynspan told a U.N. news conference Wednesday by video from Geneva that some obstacles Russia faces in terms of finance, insurance, shipping and transport of its grain and fertilizer have been clarified by the United States and European Union. But she said there is still a major bottleneck -- getting the private sector to accept that the U.N.-Russia agreement will enable their companies to be involved in getting Russian grain and fertilizer shipped to global markets without the threat of sanctions. There are no U.S. or EU sanctions on food or fertilizer exports, but companies engaged in related fields have been reluctant to take part. Russia´s war with Ukraine has had ""a chilling effect on the private sector,"" Grynspan said. ""So, an important part of the private sector has stopped their dealings in food and fertilizer."" Grynspan, the secretary-general of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, said some grain and fertilizer are being exported from Russia but at very high costs. She explained that half the increase in grain prices comes from increases in transport and logistics costs. ""That is the pressure that we want to ease,"" she said. Grynspan said the U.S. and EU clarifications are being evaluated by the private sector ""as we speak."" Grain stockpiles are expected to keep growing. Despite the war, Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal estimated his country would harvest up to 67 million tons of grain this year, up from 60 million tons last year. A senior official from a leading Ukrainian farm association reckoned Ukraine would have about 50 million tons of grain for export this year. Before the war, Ukraine exported around 5-6 million tons of grain per month, according to Denys Marchuk, the deputy head of the All-Ukrainian Agrarian Council. In other news Wednesday: __ U.S. officials believe Russia is working to fabricate evidence concerning a deadly strike on prison housing prisoners of war in a separatist region of eastern Ukraine. U.S. intelligence officials have determined that Russia is looking to plant false evidence to make it appear that Ukrainian forces were responsible for the July 29 attack on Olenivka Prison that left 53 dead and wounded dozens more, a U.S. official familiar with the intelligence finding told The Associated Press. Russia has said that Ukraine´s military used U.S.-supplied rocket launchers to strike the prison in Olenivka, a settlement controlled by the Moscow-backed Donetsk People´s Republic. __ Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy referred to Russia as ""number one"" among global sponsors of terror, and called for the creation of a bolstered global security architecture ""that ensures that no state can ever again resort to terror against another state."" __ Russian forces kept up their bombardment of the southern Ukrainian port city of Mykolaiv. Regional governor Vitaliy Kim said the shelling damaged a pier, an industrial enterprise, residential buildings, a garage cooperative, a supermarket and a pharmacy. The mayor of Mykolaiv, Oleksandr Sienkevych, told The Associated Press that 131 civilians have died so far in the city from Russian shelling and 590 others have been seriously injured. __ The Ukrainian military said Ukrainian forces pushed back over a dozen Russian assaults in the key eastern province of Donetsk and claimed that none of the Russian attempts to advance over the previous 24 hours were successful. Still, Russian shelling killed at least four civilians in Donetsk province, Ukraine´s presidential office said. Zelenskyy has ordered all those in the embattled province to evacuate as soon as possible. __ The U.N. chief says he's appointing a fact-finding mission in response to requests from Russia and Ukraine to investigate an explosion at a POW prison in a separatist region of eastern Ukraine that reportedly killed 53 Ukrainian prisoners of war and wounded another 75. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres told reporters that he doesn´t have authority to conduct criminal investigations but does have authority to conduct fact-finding missions. ___ Robert Badendieck and Mehmet Guzel in Istanbul, Aya Batrawy in Dubai, Joanna Kozlowska in London and Edith Lederer in New York contributed to this report. ___ Follow AP´s coverage of the Russia-Ukraine war at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine A boat with Russian, Ukrainian, Turkish and U.N. officials heads to the Sierra Leone-flagged cargo ship Razoni, to check if the grain shipment is in accordance with a crucial agreement signed last month by Moscow and Kyiv, at an inspection area in the Black Sea off the coast of Istanbul, Turkey, Wednesday, Aug. 3, 2022.

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-11075889/Stopping-Myanmar-violence-tops-meeting-Asian-diplomats.html,2022-08-03,Stopping Myanmar violence tops meeting of Asian diplomats,"Top Southeast Asian diplomats meeting in Cambodia's capital intensified efforts Wednesday to stop the escalating violence in Myanmar and to address other pressing - and often divisive - regional issues. It is the first in-person meeting of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations foreign ministers since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has weakened economies and complicated diplomacy, and comes at a time of increased tensions between the United States and China, as well as global increases in food and energy prices following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. ""ASEAN has to deal with challenges of different types and levels but never before, never like this year, have we been confronted at the same time with so many perils for the region and the world at large,"" Cambodian Foreign Minister Prak Sokhonn told the delegates ahead of the meetings. Cambodia currently holds the rotating chairmanship of ASEAN, which also includes the Philippines, Malaysia, Indonesia, Laos, Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam and Brunei in addition to Myanmar. Myanmar's military ousted the democratically elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi in February 2021, and the country was asked not to send any political representative to the ASEAN meetings in response to the violence that has ensued. In protest of that decision, Myanmar's military government said it would send no delegate at all, so is unrepresented in the talks, complicating efforts to push the country to comply with an ASEAN five-point plan for peace, which it has largely been ignoring. Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen delivers the opening speech for the 55th ASEAN Foreign Ministers' Meeting (55th AMM) at a hotel in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, Wednesday, Aug. 3, 2022. Southeast Asian foreign ministers are gathering in the Cambodian capital for meetings addressing persisting violence in Myanmar and other issues, joined by top diplomats from the United States, China, Russia and other world powers amid tensions over the invasion of Ukraine and concerns over Beijing's growing ambitions in the region. (AP Photo/Vincent Thian) ""You're trying to solve the problem in Myanmar without talking to them,"" conceded Cambodia's spokesperson for the meetings, Kung Phoak, a Foreign Ministry official who also serves as the group's special envoy to Myanmar. ""We are trying to talk to them, trying to explain to them, trying to express our frustration,"" he said. ""But at the same time we also want to hear from them, what they think, how they can do more, so that we can make sure that the implementation of the five-point consensus is moving forward as fast as possible."" Suu Kyi´s ouster triggered widespread peaceful protests that were violently suppressed. They have evolved into an armed resistance and the country has slipped into what some U.N. experts characterize as a civil war. Among other things, the five-point consensus calls for dialogue between all concerned parties and an immediate end to violence. The military-led government has shown little interest in following the plan, however, and last week announced that it had resumed judicial executions, hanging four political prisoners. That prompted a global outcry, including from ASEAN countries, with Malaysian Foreign Minister Saifuddin Abdullah condemning the act as a ""crime against humanity."" New sanctions are being considered and Saifuddin said ahead of the meetings that the group should think about scrapping or revising its five-point consensus. He said ASEAN´s special envoy also needs to meet with the National Unity Government, a shadow civilian administration established outside Myanmar, to help develop a new political framework. In his opening remarks, however, Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen seemed to suggest a slower approach, saying that member states were ""deeply disappointed and disturbed by the execution of those opposition activists,"" but going on to say ""if more prisoners are to be executed we will be forced to rethink our role vis-a-vis ASEAN's five-point consensus."" In a draft copy of the final communique, which was obtained by The Associated Press and could change by the end of the meetings, the ministers say they remain committed to ""accelerate the implementation of the five-point consensus"" and again ""called for the immediate cessation of violence."" More than 2,100 people have been killed by the military government since it took power and nearly 15,000 have been arrested, according to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners, a non-governmental organization that tracks killings and arrests. Following the day's meetings, Saifuddin said he had brought up proposals on strengthening the implementation of the five-point consensus and including talks with opposition groups, but that the future of the plan would have to be decided later in the year when ASEAN leaders hold their summit. ""The five-point consensus was decided by the leaders of ASEAN and only the leaders can decide what we do,"" he told reporters. The foreign ministers of China and Russia, both of which have supported Myanmar's military regime, will be attending the ASEAN meetings and could be pressed by the group for assistance in implementing the plan. China, however, has strongly stuck by a principal of non-intervention while Russia is Myanmar's top arms supplier. During a stop in Myanmar en route to Phnom Penh, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov showed no sign of any change to Moscow's stance, saying the two countries ""have a very solid foundation for building up cooperation in a wide range of areas."" ""We appreciate the traditionally friendly nature of our partnership, which is not affected by any opportunistic processes,"" Lavrov said. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who has criticized ASEAN for not doing enough to stop the violence in Myanmar, will also be in attendance in Phnom Penh. There are currently no plans for Blinken to meet one-on-one with either Wang or Lavrov, but all three major powers are expected to take part Friday in an expanded meeting called the East Asia Summit. They are also to attend the ASEAN Regional Forum, a platform for security talks where North Korea is also a member. That could be the first time Blinken and his Chinese counterpart, Wang Yi, would meet in the wake of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi´s visit to Taiwan, which provoked an angry response and threats from China, and might coincide with Chinese military exercises around the island. Combined efforts to help the region in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic's devastating impacts on tourism and other industries is another issue the ASEAN ministers set out to tackle, as well as ongoing territorial disputes in the South China Sea. In 2016, an arbitration tribunal set up in The Hague under the U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea invalidated Beijing's vast territorial claims after the Philippine government complained in 2013 about China´s increasingly aggressive actions in the disputed waters. China did not participate in the arbitration, rejected its ruling as a sham and continues to defy it. In addition to China and the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Taiwan and Brunei have had overlapping claims in the busy waterway, where an estimated $5 trillion in goods passes each year and which is believed to be rich in undersea gas and oil deposits. In the draft final communique, the group says concerns remained ""on the land reclamations, activities, and serious incidents in the area, which have eroded trust and confidence, increased tensions, and may undermine peace, security, and stability in the region."" At the same time, they ""welcomed the continuously improving cooperation between ASEAN and China"" and said they were ""encouraged by the positive progress of the substantive negotiations"" toward agreement on a code of conduct in the South China Sea. ___ Jim Gomez in Manila, Philippines, contributed to this report.

Last weekend, the U.S. did just that - killing al-Qaida leader Ayman al-Zawahri with a CIA drone strike. Other high-profile airstrikes in the past had inadvertently killed innocent civilians. In this case, the U.S. carefully chose to use a type of Hellfire missile that greatly minimized the chance of other casualties. Although U.S. officials have not publicly confirmed which variant of the Hellfire was used, experts and others familiar with counterterrorism operations said a likely option was the highly secretive Hellfire R9X - know by various nicknames, including the ""knife bomb"" or the ""flying Ginsu."" That potential use of the R9X, said Klon Kitchen, senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute and a former intelligence analyst, suggests the U.S. wanted to kill al-Zawahri with ""limited likelihood of collateral death and destruction and for other relevant political reasons."" A look at the Hellfire, and how al-Zawahri likely was killed: WHAT IS A HELLFIRE MISSILE? Originally designed as an anti-tank missile in the 1980s, the Hellfire has been used by military and intelligence agencies over the last two decades to strike targets in Iraq, Afghanistan, Yemen and elsewhere.

For a year, U.S. officials have been saying that taking out a terrorist threat in Afghanistan with no American troops on the ground would be difficult but not impossible. Last weekend, the U.S. did just that - killing al-Qaida leader Ayman al-Zawahri with a CIA drone strike. (Jason Sweeney/U.S. Army via AP) The precision-guided missiles can be mounted on helicopters and unmanned drones and are used widely in combat around the world. More than 100,000 Hellfire missiles have been sold to the U.S. and other countries, according to Ryan Brobst, an analyst at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies, a Washington think tank. ""It can do enough damage to destroy most targets such as vehicles and buildings while not doing enough damage to level city blocks and cause significant civilian casualties,"" Brobst said. The U.S. military has routinely used Hellfire missiles to kill high-value targets, including a senior al-Qaida leader in Syria last year, and al-Qaida propagandist Anwar al-Awlaki in Yemen in 2011. WHAT KILLED AL-ZAWAHRI? The U.S. had multiple options for the attack. It could have used a traditional Hellfire, a bomb dropped from an manned aircraft, or a far more risky assault by ground forces. U.S. Navy SEALs, for example, flew into Pakistan on helicopters and took out Osama bin Laden in a raid. In this case, the CIA opted for a drone strike. And while the CIA generally doesn´t confirm its counterterrorism missions and closely guards information about strikes it conducts, U.S. government officials have said that two Hellfire missiles were fired at the balcony of the building where al-Zawahri was living in Kabul. Online images of the building show damage to the balcony, where the U.S. says al-Zawahri was, but the rest of the house is standing and not badly damaged. Unlike other models of the Hellfire, the R9X doesn´t carry an explosive payload. Instead, it has a series of six rotating blades that emerge on its final approach to a target, Kitchen said. ""One of their utilities is in opening up vehicles and other obstructions to get to the target without having to use an explosive warhead,"" he said. AVOIDING CIVILIAN CASUALTIES U.S. officials and experts made clear this week that avoiding civilian casualties was a crucial element in the choice of weapon. Less than a year ago, a U.S. drone strike - using a more conventional Hellfire missile - struck a white Toyota Corolla sedan in a Kabul neighborhood and killed 10 civilians around and near the car, including seven children. In the midst of the chaotic U.S. military withdrawal from Afghanistan, American forces believed there were explosives in the car and that it posed an imminent threat to troops on the ground. It was, military leaders said, a ""tragic mistake"" One former U.S. official said the likely choice of an R9X is an example of the administration's effort to find ways to minimize collateral damage and prevent the loss of innocent life. That missile is a very accurate weapon that strikes in a very small area, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss counterterrorism operations. An administration official said Monday that the U.S. investigated the construction of the house where al-Zawahri was staying in order to ensure that the operation could be done without threatening the structural integrity of the building and also minimizing the risks of killing civilians, including members of his family who were in other parts of the house. The choice of missile is ultimately one part of reducing the possibility of killing civilians or causing other collateral damage. ""I would say this is by far a lower-risk option,"" said Tom Karako, an expert on missile defense at the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies. Using the Hellfire, he said, ""reflects a high degree of caution as opposed to a riskiness."" IS THE US PROVIDING UKRAINE WITH DRONES THAT CAN FIRE HELLFIRE MISSILES? No. While the U.S. has delivered billions of dollars in military assistance to help Ukraine fight the invading Russian troops, it is wary of providing weapons that could fire deep into Russia, potentially escalating the conflict or drawing the U.S. into the war. As a result, the U.S. so far has not provided Hellfire missiles or drones that could fire them. Instead, the U.S. has delivered smaller, so-called kamikaze drones, such as the Switchblade and Phoenix Ghost, which instead of firing missiles, explode when they hit a target.

Wednesday´s 95-1 vote - for the candidacy of two Western European nations that, until Russia´s war against Ukraine, had long avoided military alliances - took a crucial step toward expansion of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and its 73-year-old pact of mutual defense among the United States and democratic allies in Europe. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer invited ambassadors of the two nations to the chamber gallery to witness the vote. President Joe Biden, who has been the principal player rallying global economic and material support for Ukraine, has sought quick entry for the two previously non-militarily aligned northern European nations. ""This historic vote sends an important signal of the sustained, bipartisan U.S. commitment to NATO, and to ensuring our Alliance is prepared to meet the challenges of today and tomorrow,"" Biden said in a statement Wednesday evening. ""I look forward to signing the accession protocols and welcoming Sweden and Finland, two strong democracies with highly capable militaries, into the greatest defensive alliance in history,"" the president added. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., right, welcomes Paivi Nevala, minister counselor of the Finnish Embassy, left, and Karin Olofsdotter, Sweden's ambassador to the U.S., center, just before the Senate vote to ratify NATO membership for the two nations in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, at the Capitol in Washington, Wednesday, Aug. 3, 2022. (AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite) Approval from all member nations - currently, 30 - is required. The candidacies of the two prosperous Northern European nations have won ratification from more than half of the NATO member nations in the roughly three months since the two applied. It´s a purposely rapid pace meant to send a message to Russia over its six-month-old war against Ukraine´s West-looking government. ""It sends a warning shot to tyrants around the world who believe free democracies are just up for grabs,"" Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., said in the Senate debate ahead of the vote. ""Russia´s unprovoked invasion has changed the way we think about world security,"" she added. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, who visited Kyiv earlier this year, urged unanimous approval. Speaking to the Senate, McConnell cited Finland´s and Sweden´s well-funded, modernizing militaries and their experience working with U.S. forces and weapons systems, calling it a ""slam-dunk for national security"" of the United States. ""Their accession will make NATO stronger and America more secure. If any senator is looking for a defensible excuse to vote no, I wish them good luck,"" McConnell said. Sen. Josh Hawley, a Missouri Republican who often aligns his positions with those of the most ardent supporters of former President Donald Trump, cast the only no vote. Hawley took the Senate floor to call European security alliances a distraction from what he called the United States´ chief rival - China, not Russia. ""We can do more in Europe ... devote more resources, more firepower ... or do what we need to do to deter Asia and China. We cannot do both,"" Hawley said, calling his a ""classic nationalist approach"" to foreign policy. Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas, like Hawley a potential 2024 presidential contender, rebutted his points without naming his potential Republican rival. That included arguing against Hawley´s contention a bigger NATO would mean more obligations for the U.S. military, the world´s largest. Cotton was one of many citing the two nations´ military strengths - including Finland´s experience securing its hundreds of miles of border with Russia and its well-trained ground forces, and Sweden´s well-equipped navy and air force. They´re ""two of the strongest members of the alliance the minute they join,"" Cotton said. U.S. State and Defense officials consider the two countries net ""security providers,"" strengthening NATO´s defense posture in the Baltics in particular. Finland is expected to exceed NATO´s 2% GDP defense spending target in 2022, and Sweden has committed to meet the 2% goal. That´s in contrast to many of NATO´s newcomers formerly from the orbit of the Soviet Union, many with smaller militaries and economies. North Macedonia, NATO´s most recent newcomer nation, brought an active military of just 8,000 personnel when it joined in 2020. Senators' votes approving NATO candidacies often are lopsided - the one for North Macedonia was 91-2. But Wednesday's approval from nearly all senators present carried added foreign policy weight in light of Russia's war. Schumer, D-N.Y., said he and McConnell had committed to the country´s leaders that the Senate would approve the ratification resolution ""as fast as we could"" to bolster the alliance ""in light of recent Russian aggression."" Sweden and Finland applied in May, setting aside their longstanding stance of military nonalignment. It was a major shift of security arrangements for the two countries after neighboring Russia launched its war on Ukraine in late February. Biden encouraged their joining and welcomed the two countries´ government heads to the White House in May, standing side by side with them in a display of U.S. backing. The U.S. and its European allies have rallied with newfound partnership in the face of Putin's military invasion, as well as the Russian leader's sweeping statements this year condemning NATO, issuing veiled reminders of Russia's nuclear arsenal and asserting Russia's historical claims to territory of many of its neighbors. ""Enlarging NATO is exactly the opposite of what Putin envisioned when he ordered his tanks to invade Ukraine,"" Sen. Bob Menendez, a New Jersey Democrat and chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said Wednesday, adding that the West could not allow Russia to ""launch invasions of countries."" Wednesday's vote by Republicans and Democrats stood out for the normally slow-moving and divided chamber. Senators voted down a proposed amendment by Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., intended to ensure that NATO´s guarantee to defend its members does not replace a formal role for Congress in authorizing the use of military force. Paul, a longtime advocate of keeping the U.S. out of most military action abroad, voted ""present"" on the ratification of Sweden and Finland's membership bid. Senators approved another amendment from Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, declaring that all NATO members should spend a minimum of 2% of their gross domestic product on defense and 20% of their defense budgets on major equipment, including research and development. Each member government in NATO must give its approval for any new member to join. The process ran into unexpected trouble when Turkey raised concerns over adding Sweden and Finland, accusing the two of being soft on banned Turkish Kurdish exile groups. Turkey´s objections still threaten the two countries´ membership. ___ Follow AP's coverage of NATO at https://apnews.com/hub/nato.
