Russia’s war in Ukraine has been defined by tragedy, brutality and a battle of wills, but no campaign in Ukraine has shown this more than the seven-month-long fight for Kharkiv, one commander told Fox News. ""If people want to understand this war fully,"" Commander of the 127th Brigade of the Territorial Defense Forces of Kharkiv Roman Hryshchenko said speaking from a post in Kharkiv, ""there is no war between Ukraine and Russia.""

""When we talk about the 127th Brigade, it should be understood that before the full-scale invasion, almost all of them had never held a weapon in their hands,"" he said in an interview translated by the Ukraine Frontline Media Platform. Hryshchenko, who is called ""Uncle Roma"" by his troops, explained that the 127th Brigade was established as a volunteer force following Russia’s invasion, with just 30% of its troops having had previous soldiering experience in eastern Ukraine. ""The rest are entirely civilian people,"" he said of the roughly 5,000 strong fighting force. ""More than 70% [had] never held a weapon in their hands but who came to defend their land."" Ukrainian forces are seen in Izium after Russian forces withdraw from the Izium City, Kharkiv Oblast, Ukraine on Sept. 16, 2022. Moscow was never able to fully occupy Kharkiv despite its best efforts – a defeat made even more impressive by the fact that the Ukrainian region shares a border with Russia. However, its proximity to Russia meant the brigade would see some of the most consistently brutal warfare, not only in Ukraine, but in Europe since World War .

It would be another three months before the region saw some reprieve, as fighting stalled after the brigade successfully launched a counter-offensive and pushed Russian troops back across their national lines. The British defense ministry chalked it up to Russia's ""inability"" to understand the level of resistance it would receive from civilian populations across Ukraine. ""You know Kharkiv very poorly,"" Hryshchenko said in explanation as to why the region proved so difficult for the invading forces to take, despite its proximity to Russia. ""Our people are made of iron and concrete."" ""The enemy is not fighting our army, it is fighting the civilian population,"" he added.

The court also found that a Russian missile was responsible for the strike.

The ruling helps bring a close to an eight-year-long case that captured the world’s attention after a civilian flight traveling from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur on July 17, 2014, was shot down while flying over eastern Ukraine.

""There is plentiful evidence"" to support the belief that the missile was shot from a field in rebel-held territory, Steenhuis said, squashing concerns that the evidence may not have been enough to secure a conviction. ""There is no reasonable doubt possible,"" he added in dismissal of the defenses' arguments that something might have happened to the plane. Russians Igor Girkin and Sergey Dubinskiy, and Ukrainian separatist Leonid Kharchenko apparently worked together to transfer the Buk missile from a Russian military base into Ukraine for launch.

A top Russian military officer reportedly died after being shot five times in his office at a prestigious military academy. Reports in Russia claim that Col. Vadim Boyko, 44, entered his office at the Makarov Pacific Higher Naval School on Wednesday morning, after which a duty officer heard five gunshots and ran in to find the colonel dead. Authorities found a Makarov pistol and bullet cases next to his body, according to Russian news outlet Pravda. Some outlets questioned if the colonel had committed suicide, but the lack of a suicide note and the presence of multiple gunshots — and most of them in his chest — has suggested that is unlikely. Criminal investigators continue to work to determine what happened. Boyko was involved in Russian President Vladimir Putin’s mobilization effort to recruit and bolster the military’s forces, and his death will have a ""demoralizing"" effect on troop morale, according to Russia expert Rebekah Koffler. . : ‘ ’ ""Whether this is a suicide or an assassination, Col. Boyko’s death is almost certainly extremely demoralizing for the Russian military, especially their troops on the ground,"" Koffler, a Russian-born former Defense Intelligence Agency officer and author of ""Putin’s Playbook,"" told Fox News Digital. Russian navy officers take part in a graduation ceremony at the Makarov Pacific Higher Naval School in Vladivostok, Russia June 18, 2022. ""Any serving Russian military officer is now in an untenable position because they know that sooner or later they will be deployed into the theater, which is pretty much a death sentence, with the way this war is unfolding, and that is a hard truth to accept for the soldiers and their families,"" Koffler said.

The leader of a Kremlin-backed mercenary group voiced his approval for the brutal, deadly bludgeoning of a recruit who deserted to Ukraine. A man identified as Yevgeny Nuzhin said in footage published over the weekend that he surrendered to Ukrainian troops in September but was kidnapped in Kyiv on Friday, according to The Moscow Times. The footage then reportedly depicts Nuzhin being beaten to death with a sledgehammer by a Wagner group member.

Where the Russia-Ukraine war stands nine months after invasion,"Former U.S. intel officer Rebekah Koffler reacts to the Russian government's failure to inform the Biden White House of Brittney Griner’s transfer to a penal colony last week on 'Fox News Live.' Washington will soon debate sending billions more to Ukraine to assist its war effort. Lawmakers may want to first conduct a reality check on where Russia stands in this nine-month war and on Putin’s decision calculus. This suggests that U.S. funding will not produce quick results, may not produce any results or may also produce very bad results for America and Ukraine. This is how, when wishful thinking is set aside, things actually look: The Battlefield Multiple areas across Ukraine are still under Russian assault, even as Ukrainian forces are gaining momentum with an effective counter-offensive, pushing to reclaim territories captured by Russia. On Friday, special units of Ukraine’s armed forces entered the strategic city of Kherson in southern Ukraine, following the retreat of the Russian troops as directed by the Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu. As Ukraine’s president Zelenskyy was championing another victory, the Kremlin warned that Kherson’s status didn’t change, despite the retreat, claiming that the city was still ‘part of Russia.’ The Russians are unlikely to permanently abandon Kherson or any of the three regions that Moscow recently ""annexed."" The Russian ground forces who assumed defensive positions on the left bank of the Dniepr River, will probably not engage in a mano-a-mano battle with Ukrainians, having lost so many men and so much military hardware. The withdrawal is a potential ruse to lure Ukrainian troops into a radioactive chamber. Russian Spetsnaz operatives reportedly left a nasty message on a door of one of the buildings. Addressed to Ukrainians, the message warned that this was ""the territory of the Russian Empire,"" that Putin was ""our and your Czar"" and that the Russian troops went ""on vacation."" Vladimir Putin and his Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu stand together during a Navy Day Parade in Saint Petersburg, Russia in July. ’S 'S For weeks, Moscow has been accusing Kyiv of planning to use a ""dirty bomb,"" also called a radiological dispersal device , an improvised nuclear device containing dynamite laced with radioactive powder. Unlike traditional nuclear bombs, s have low military value but produce panic and terror in the opposing force and population. They cause severe burns, irradiation sickness, and they contaminate food and water. Driving Ukrainians out of the region by contamination would be consistent with Russia’s most recent military doctrine, which envisions use of radiological, chemical and biological warfare for ""defensive"" purposes. The Russians have a special military branch, Radiological, Chemical and Biological Defense Forces , that are trained in decontamination and clean up. A New Strategy of Indirect Action Russia has all but exhausted its conventional combat power, having fired around 4,000 missiles and, according to Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark Milley, have lost some 100,000 personnel to death or injury. Morale is low. Special units are sent to the front lines to shoot retreating soldiers and deserters. Multiple Russian commanders have failed to secure victory. However, despite Washington’s expectations, Putin will not abandon the fight. His regime views the stakes as existential for him and for Russia. Moscow wants Ukraine to remain part of its strategic security perimeter, on which it relied for centuries. Putin will continue to enforce his version of the Monroe Doctrine to keep troops and influence out of a country that has a 1400-mile border with Russia. President Biden and his Russia counterpart Vladimir Putin have not spoken in months. - - Under the new ""asymmetric"" strategy, Moscow is targeting critical infrastructure to leave Ukrainians without water, electricity and heat as winter approaches. Missile and drone strikes on Kyiv’s electrical grid have left half a million homes without power. Local authorities are mulling evacuation plans should the city become unlivable. Forty percent of the country’s energy infrastructure has been crippled, and multiple industries have incurred devastating cyber strikes. Loss of power will result in lack of water, causing sewage problems that will spread disease. In late October, Ukraine’s intelligence services uncovered Russia’s plot to blow up the Nova Kakhovka hydroelectric dam to trigger a massive flood in southern Ukraine. Couple that with a dirty bomb in Kherson, and a large swath of the country will become an environmental disaster. The main target in this phase of war is the population, its psychological state and its will to fight. Putin’s Health and Regime Stability Endless rumors abound about Putin’s deteriorating physical and mental condition – anything from thyroid to pancreatic cancer, to Parkinson’s, a mysterious mental illness caused by -related isolation, and more. It is impossible, even for U.S. intelligence, to assess Putin’s health with high accuracy. Putin takes extreme measures – including having his security personnel collect his excrement and urine when he travels - to safeguard information about his health. There is no credible evidence Putin has a chronic condition like cancer. Instead, Putin appears ""entirely too healthy,"" as Director William Burns recently assessed. Russian President Vladimir Putin with troops. Rumors are swirling about the marks on Putin's hand. Two weeks ago, the Russian strongman put on a three-hour performance, including a speech and Q&A, at the annual international ""Valdai"" conference hosted by Russia. Putin was lucid, forceful, confident and looked healthy. There is no credible evidence suggesting the imminent collapse of Putin’s regime, his ouster or forced retirement into a sanatorium. What the future holds Putin is preparing for the long haul and even an all-out war, anticipating intervention. Moscow has mobilized additional 318,000 men and mandated basic military training in high school. It has expanded military cooperation with Iran and North Korea to replenish its depleting weapons supply. Russia is standing up bomb shelters, training police in wartime protocols and conducting emergency evacuation drills. Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine is now into its ninth month with no end in sight The Biden administration’s solution to the Russia-Ukraine problem has been to hit Russia with more sanctions, deprive another Russian oligarch of his yacht or palace and send billions in aid to Ukraine. This is naïve and simplistic. The question of control over the post-Soviet space has been festering since the collapse of the in 1991, and the balance of power in Eurasia has been contested for centuries. So victory is not around the corner, nor will it be defined by President Biden. That the Washington establishment is dragging America into yet another geopolitical experiment as Ukrainians are being slaughtered and their country ruined is irresponsible and dangerous. We are dealing with a nuclear power that is predisposed for the worst-case scenario thinking, and it will invoke the worst case before it accepts defeat in Ukraine.",14,4.328288146369875,3.3844776208650393,0.9438105255048357,11

Wallace said Russia’s withdraw from the southern city just two months after its forces were forced out of Kharkiv marked ""another strategic failure for them."" ""Now with [Kherson] also being surrendered, ordinary people of Russia must surely ask themselves ‘What was it all for?’,"" he questioned.

""Our people. Ours. Kherson,"" Zelenskyy wrote on Telegram. ""Today is a historic day. We are taking back Kherson.""

Videos emerged on social media showing Ukrainians in the city center chanting and celebrating, some with their pets while others held kids on their shoulders, though Fox News has not been able to independently verify these videos. The full retreat came after Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu gave the order to withdraw Wednesday as Ukrainian forces continued to advance in another counter-offensive operation. Russia’s Defense Ministry said that all remaining troops had been ordered out of the city of Kherson to the eastside of the Dnieper River and that ""not a single piece of military equipment or weapons"" had been left behind. Russia’s decision to remove its limited supplies is a change in operational strategy following its failure to hold its military lines or equipment in Kharkiv earlier this year. Recapturing Kherson is one of the biggest successes Kyiv has seen since it retook control over Kharkiv in September, but some defense officials are concerned it could be a Russian ploy.

Australian Federal Police took the unusual step of attributing blame for the unsolved cybercrime that resulted in the personal data of 9.7 million current and former Medibank customers being stolen. A group of ""loosely affiliated cybercriminals"" operating like a business in Russia were likely responsible for the Medibank attack as well as other significant security breaches around the world, Australian Federal Police Commissioner Reece Kershaw said. ""We believe we know which individuals are responsible, but I will not be naming them,"" Kershaw told reporters. ""What I will say is that we’ll be holding talks with Russian law enforcement about these individuals."" Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, who is a Medibank customer who had personal data stolen, said he had authorized police to reveal where the attack had come from. ""We know where they’re coming from, we know who is responsible, and we say that they should be held to account,"" Albanese said. ""The nation where these attacks are coming from should also be held accountable for the disgusting attacks, and the release of information including very private and personal information,"" Albanese added. An official from the Russian Embassy in Australia could not be immediately contacted for comment. The extortionists have been linked to high-profile Russian cybercrime gang vil, short for Ransomware Evil and also known as Sodinokibi. The Russian Federal Security Service said in January vil ""ceased to exist"" after several arrests were made at the insistence of the United States. An old vil dark web site had started redirecting traffic to a new site that hosts the stolen Medibank data. Fergus Hanson, director of Australian Strategic Policy Institute think tank’s cyber policy center, said he was not surprised that the crime gang was based in Russia. 2 A Medibank employee’s stolen username and password, which allowed the hackers to enter the company’s database, had been sold on a Russian dark web forum, Hanson said. Hanson doubted that culprits operating in Russia would be brought to justice. But Australia could use its offensive cyber capabilities against the gang in Russia and prosecute their affiliates, who police suspect are operating in other countries. ""There’s potential to conduct operations against the group to disrupt their operations, but in terms of seeing them go to prison or appear before a court, I think that’s pretty unlikely,"" Hanson told Australian Broadcasting Corp. People walk past a Medibank branch in Sydney on Nov. 11, 2022. Extortionists have dumped personal medical records on the dark web for a third day as they pressure Australia's largest health insurer to pay a ransom. Cybercriminals dumped personal medical records on the dark web for a third day on Friday, this time focusing on alcohol-related illnesses, as they pressure Medibank to pay a ransom. The criminals began dumping customer records Wednesday, including those involving treatments for and drug addiction, which they described as a ""naughty"" list, after Medibank ruled out paying a ransom for the return of the hacked data. The focus shifted to terminated pregnancies in Thursday’s dump and on Friday to conditions related to harmful levels of alcohol consumption, in a file the thieves labeled ""boozy."" Medical treatment records of more than 700 customers had been published through Friday in what has been described as Australia’s most invasive cybercrime. Other personal details of many more customers have also been made public that could leave them vulnerable to identity theft or fraud, including phone numbers and email addresses. Confirming the third dump, Medibank David Koczkar said his company was contacting exposed customers and offering support. He expected the daily dumps would continue. ""The relentless nature of this tactic being used by the criminal is designed to cause distress and harm,"" Koczkar said. , ""These are real people behind this data and the misuse of their data is deplorable and may discourage them from seeking medical care,"" he added. The gang, which is becoming increasingly better known as BlogXX within cybersecurity circles, blamed Medibank's failure to pay a $9.7 million ransom demand. ""But we warned you. we always keep our word, if we wouldn't receive a ransom - we should post this data, because nobody will believe us in the future,"" they posted on Friday. Kershaw said Australian government policy did not condone paying ransoms to cybercriminals. ""Any ransom payment, small or large, fuels the cybercrime business model, putting other Australians at risk,"" Kershaw said. Australian authorities are hoping the data remains confined to the dark web and is not spread to a wider audience by social media or reported in detail by the news media. Albanese urged against anyone accessing the data. ""We need to provide a disincentive for this sort of criminal, disgusting behavior that is reprehensible,"" Albanese said.",3,6.272285301449587,5.103004993730754,1.1692803077188332,7

She added that ""Russia's missile arsenal is almost certainly depleting,"" and current inventory is ""probably"" below 40% of pre-war levels. The U.S. on Wednesday accused North Korea of secretly supplying Russia with artillery shells, and reports over the past month detailed how Iran first supplied Russia with Shahed-136 ""kamikaze"" drones and then trained Russian troops in their use. New reports indicate that Iran added Mohajer-6 as well as Shahed-129 drones to its shipments. White House National Security spokesperson John Kirby told a virtual briefing that North Korea had attempted to hide the shipments by sending them through countries in the Middle East and North Africa, Reuters reported. ""Our indications are that the is covertly supplying and we are going to monitor to see whether the shipments are received,"" Kirby said, adding that Washington would consult with the United Nations on accountability issues over the shipments. ""We do have a sense on where they are going to transfer these shells,"" Kirby said. He declined to give any more details as the U.S. weighs its possible options. But he insisted that the weapons would not likely change the momentum or outcome of the war. Russian self-propelled artillery vehicles roll during the Victory Day military parade in Moscow, Russia, May 9. The Foundation for the Defense of Democracies reported that Iran may even increase its support and provide Russia with short-range ballistic missiles, a move that indicates any economic relief Tehran would gain through the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action — also known as the Iran nuclear deal — would end up funding Russia’s war and undercut U.S. sanctions. ""With reports that Iran plans to send short-range ballistic missiles to Russia to use against Ukraine — and as the people of Iran cry out in the streets for a change in regime — the U.S. and its European allies should withdraw all sanctions relief offers made to Tehran and complete the snapback of U.N. sanctions at the Security Council,"" Richard Goldberg, a senior advisor at the , wrote in an analysis published Wednesday. , The transfer would include Fateh-110 and Zulfiqar short-range ballistic missiles. The Fateh-110 can reach a distance of 150-180 miles, while the Zulfiqar could potentially reach targets within 435 miles. Iran already sent over 3,500 drones to Russia, with most of the units produced in factories operated by the Iranian Ministry of Defense and the Iranian Aviation and Space Industries Association . Russian military vehicles move on a highway in an area controlled by Russian-backed separatist forces near Mariupol, Ukraine, in late April. Weapons alone will not win the war as Putin also looked to replenish his depleted forces. After months of silence about the true number of casualties, both Director William Burns and British Intelligence Chief Richard Moore indicated that Russia lost around 15,000 troops over the first five months of the invasion. ""We've seen for months now attempts by Russia to recruit sort of their own version of the foreign legion, of particular communities by the Wagner Group in the field from Syria, from Libya, from the Central African Republic,"" Goldberg told Fox News Digital. ""We've heard reports of Serbians, as well, fighting on the pro-Russia side."" 'S : ""[One of] the main motivations for doing this for the Russians is they're quickly depleting their own forces,"" Goldberg explained. ""They are moving into reserve call-ups, and they don't want to have to continue taxing the Russian population wherever possible. ""So to the extent that they can lean on foreign troops to do the work, to have non-Russians fighting and dying rather than Russian bodies coming home to their families, that's their preference,"" he added, noting that Putin is seeking ""low-cost, high-impact systems."" Russian and Belarusian armed forces take part in a military drill in Gomel, Belarus, Feb. 19. Putin attempted to replenish his forces through a forced enlistment by announcing a ""partial mobilization,"" but many Russian men decided to flee the country rather than join Putin’s war in Ukraine. Russia had already drawn in Chechen fighters in the early phase of the Ukraine war after it became clear the conflict would not end as soon as Putin had believed and would require more commitment. Reports started to emerge over the following months of Russia reaching out to friendly nations and seeking reinforcements. The New York Times in April reported that Putin had looked to Syrian and Georgian fighters to bolster its forces. And multiple Afghan military and security sources last week said that elite National Army Commando Corps soldiers started joining the Russian forces after the U.S. left behind the 20,000 to 30,000-member force following its military drawdown. Ukrainian firefighters put out a fire after a strike in Zaporizhzhia Oct. 6, 2022, amid the Russian invasion of Ukraine. As many as 10,000 of the former commandos were initially inclined to accept Russia’s offer, Foreign Policy reported. Goldberg likened Russia’s growing coalition to Ukraine’s International Legion, which Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy established at the start of the conflict. It drew 20,000 volunteers from 52 countries in the first week. ""Moscow is running low both military hardware and personnel, having to fill the gaps with non-indigenous capabilities. It’s procuring weapons from Iran and North Korea and is relying on the mercenary contingent, the Wagner Group, the Chechen fighters, Kadyrov, to replenish its regular forces,"" Koffler said. ""They are even recruiting prisoners and bringing in former Afghan security forces, who were displaced as the Taliban came back to power, after the U.S. withdrawal. ""Despite all of these limitations, Putin will not back down. To the contrary, he is preparing for an all-out fight with the U.S. and and switching to asymmetric strategy.""

Russia launched a Soyuz rocket carrying a military satellite into space Wednesday, according to reports, as the U.N. looks to prevent a spaced-based arms race. A Soyuz-2.1b medium-class launch vehicle was apparently launched shortly before 3 a.m. from the Plesetsk Cosmodrome, Reuters reported, quoting the Russian defense ministry. Fox News could not independently verify the launch of the rocket, whose mission was not made clear and comes as tensions between Moscow and Washington have mounted over space-based operations. A Soyuz rocket blasts off from the launch pad at Russia's space facility in Baikonur, Kazakhstan, Wednesday, Nov. 24, 2021. X 2 In coordination with the U.S. Space Force, Elon Musk’s SpaceX launched a rocket carrying two military satellites and several smaller satellites Tuesday in a classified mission. Concerns over an arms race in space involving Moscow and Washington first began in the 1950s in the lead-up to the height of the Cold War. The fall of the Soviet Union ushered in a period of international space cooperation when Russia was invited to join the International Space Station in December 1993. But the 30-year collaborative was brought under renewed strain earlier this year when Moscow said in July it would opt out of the International Space Station project after 2024. By August, Russia’s space agency Roscosmos revealed plans to develop its own space station in a move that renewed concern over the threat of a new space race.

But in the same breath Russia’s delegate Konstantin Vorontsov warned that Moscow may begin to target Western civilian satellites over their involvement in the war in Ukraine. Vorontsov did not specifically mention SpaceX – which has donated over 20,000 satellites to Ukraine and proved vital in Kyiv’s ability to communicate on the front lines – but said the U.S. was setting an ""extremely dangerous trend."" ""The use by the United States and its allies of civilian, including commercial, infrastructure elements in outer space for military purposes constitute indirect participation [in the war],"" he added. Ukraine does not have its own satellite fleet and Russia routinely deploys satellites into orbit, including last month when three Gonets-M satellites were launched ""to transmit data and provide mobile satellite communications services to mobile and stationary subscribers anywhere in the world,"" Roscosmos said in a Telegram post, reported Space.com.

Moscow-installed officials ordered Ukrainians to leave the eastern bank of the Dnieper River in a move that Kyiv has condemned as an attempt to forcibly deport its citizens to Russia, reported Reuters. Intense fighting has raged for months in the city of Kherson as Ukrainian forces look to retake the southern region after an eight-month-long occupation. People arrived from Kherson hold their bags as they wait for further evacuation into the depths of Russia at the Dzhankoi's railway station in Crimea on Oct. 21, 2022. : Earlier this month, Russia called on its top security officials and their families to flee the area before ordering evacuations from Kherson. That order was expanded by Vladimir Saldo, the Russia-installed head of the Kherson region, Tuesday in a video message, where he called on all Ukrainians in a 9-mile radius of the Dnieper River to evacuate. ""Due to the possibility of the use of prohibited methods of war by the Ukrainian regime, as well as information that Kyiv is preparing a massive missile strike on the Kakhovka hydroelectric station, there is an immediate danger of the Kherson region being flooded,"" Saldo reportedly claimed. ""Given the situation, I have decided to expand the evacuation zone by 15 km from the Dnieper,"" he said.

Earlier this month, Russia claimed it had knowledge of Ukrainian intent to deploy a ""dirty bomb"" – a primitive weapon that detonates by using a conventional explosive like dynamite but releases radioactive materials. No such device has yet been used by either Russia or Ukraine, and the U.S., France and the U.K. condemned the claims as ""transparently false."" Evacuees from Kherson gather upon their arrival at the railway station in Dzhankoi, Crimea, on Oct. 21, 2022. Russian authorities, who initially dismissed talk of evacuating the city, sharply changed course this week, warning that Kherson could come under massive Ukrainian shelling and encouraging residents to leave. The Kherson region has become not only one of the hardest fought over regions since the war began, but one of the most strategically consequential as crossing the Dnieper River would push Ukrainian forces closer to Crimea – which Kyiv has vowed to retake after being under Russian occupation since 2014. Ukrainian defense officials have remained ambiguous on operational updates in Kherson, but reporting in recent days suggests that weather and on-the-ground conditions have slowed Ukrainian advancements.",14,4.816538491480742,4.148676505859531,0.6678619856212107,22

Russian agents may have hacked former Prime Minister Liz Truss’s personal phone during her summer leadership challenge that led to her taking the role of prime minister, according to reports. The agents, suspected of working at the direction of Russian President Vladimir Putin, may have gained access to top-secret negotiations with key international allies and personal messages between Truss and her future Chancellor of the Exchequer Kwasi Kwarteng. A U.K. Government spokesperson told Fox News Digital that while the government does not comment on individual security arrangements, ""The Government has robust systems in place to protect against cyber threats,"" including ""regular security briefings for ministers and advice on protecting their personal data."" The government allegedly knew of the hack during the summer, but then-Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Cabinet Secretary Simon Case suppressed details about the hack, the Daily Mail reported.

The resolution – which passed with 85 votes – said the governing body ""strongly condemns Russian aggression"" and called on ""all countries that support peace, democracy and human rights to recognize the authorities of the Russian Federation as a terrorist regime."" Polish lawmakers outlined accounts of torture, forced deportations, murder of civilians and intentional strikes on civilian locations to back their calls to characterize Russia as a state sponsor of terrorism. Emergency workers move a body during an exhumation in the recently retaken area of Izium, Ukraine, Friday, Sept. 16, 2022. , , '' ""We know all these acts of state terrorism well from the history books,"" a statement accompanying the resolution said. ""Europeans believed that they would never again be threatened with genocide and war crimes. Meanwhile, Vladimir Putin and his apparatus of violence returned to the cruel practices of the Stalinist and Nazi regimes."" Polish lawmakers said that Moscow’s war ambitions in Ukraine ""must be defeated"" and Russia ""deprived of the possibility of endangering its neighbors."" Lawmakers in Poland are not alone in their push to recognize Russia as a terrorist state. Senators Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., and Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., introduced legislation last month calling on the U.S. Congress to do the same.

The Ukrainian Air Force said it had been able to destroy 18 of the 33 cruise missiles that rained down on critical infrastructure in at least five regions across the country. Another 10 Iranian-gifted Shahed drones have been shot down by Ukrainian forces over the southern Mykolaiv region since Friday.

Ukrainians in cities like Kyiv and Dnipro bunkered down amid hours-long air raids and power outages. The attacks also reportedly shut down water supplies in several of the regions. Ukraine’s national grid operator Ukrenergo said the attacks had largely targeted the main networks in western Ukraine, but that power had been restricted in 10 regions across the country as a precautionary measure. ""The consumer restrictions are necessary to reduce the load on the networks and avoid repeated accidents after the power grids were damaged by terrorist missile attacks,"" the agency said in a message posted to Telegram. Ukrenergo has urged Ukrainian citizens to avoid using electricity as much as possible, particularly during peak hours to preserve resources. Russia has increasingly relied on air strikes as its forces have faltered on the front lines, and since Oct. 10 at least half of Ukraine’s thermal power generation and more than 30 percent of its energy infrastructure has been shut down, according to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

2022-10-14,Fox,https://www.foxnews.com/world/putin-call-up-russian-reservists-finish-2-weeks,Putin: Call-up of Russian reservists to finish in 2 weeks,"Russian President Vladimir Putin said Friday he expects a mobilization of army reservists he ordered last month to bolster his country's troops in Ukraine to be completed in two weeks. Putin told reporters after attending a summit in Kazakhstan that 222,000 of the 300,000 reservists the Russian Defense Ministry said would get called up have been mobilized. A total of 33,000 of them are already in military units and 16,000 are involved in combat, he said. The call-up, announced by Putin in September, has proved hugely unpopular in Russia, where almost all men under the age of 65 are registered as reservists. At the same time, the Kremlin has faced domestic criticism of its handling of the war, increasing pressure on Putin to do more to turn the tide in Russia’s favor. The Russian leader initially described the mobilization as ""partial"" and said only those with combat or service experience would be drafted. However, a decree he signed outlined almost no specific criteria. - ‘ ’ Russian media reports have described attempts to round up men without the relevant experience, including those ineligible for service for medical reasons. In the wake of the president's mobilization order, tens of thousands of men left Russia. Putin also said Friday there was no need for more widespread attacks against Ukraine, such as those Russia launched Monday in retaliation for an Oct. 8 truck bomb explosion on a prized bridge linking Russia to Crimea, which Moscow seized from Ukraine in 2014. The Kerch Bridge explosion followed Ukraine’s recapturing of occupied areas in the country’s east and south in continuing counteroffensives that have restored Ukrainian confidence and embarrassed Russia's military. Russia has promised free accommodation to residents of Ukraine's partially occupied Kherson region who want to evacuate to Russia, a sign that Ukrainian military gains along the war's southern front are worrying the Kremlin. In this image taken from video released by the Russian Investigative Committee, employees of the Russian Investigative Committee work at the scene of a damaged part of the Crimean Bridge connecting Russian mainland and Crimean peninsula over the Kerch Strait, near Kerch, Crimea, Saturday, Oct. 8, 2022. The Moscow-installed leader of Kherson, one of four regions illegally annexed by Putin last month, asked the Kremlin to organize an evacuation from four cities, citing incessant shelling by Ukrainian forces. Vladimir Saldo, the head of the Moscow-appointed regional administration, said a decision was made to evacuate Kherson residents to the Russian regions of Rostov, Krasnodar and Stavropol, as well as to the Crimean Peninsula, which Moscow annexed from Ukraine in 2014. ""We, residents of the Kherson region, of course know that Russia doesn’t abandon their own, and Russia always offers a hand,"" Saldo said Thursday. Russia has characterized the movement of Ukrainians to Russia or Russian-controlled territory as voluntary, but in many cases those are the only evacuation routes residents of occupied areas can or are allowed to take. 'S '' : Reports have surfaced that some Ukrainians were forcibly deported to ""filtration camps"" with harsh conditions. In addition, an Associated Press investigation found that Russian officials deported thousands of Ukrainian children - some orphaned, others living with foster families or in institutions - to be raised as Russian. The evacuation announcement came as Ukrainian forces pushed deeper into the Kherson region, albeit at a slower pace than a few weeks ago. Ukrainian forces reported retaking 75 populated places in the region in the last month, Ukraine's Ministry for Reintegration of Temporarily Occupied Territories said late Thursday night. A similar campaign in eastern Ukraine resulted in most of the Kharkiv region returning to Ukrainian control, as well as parts of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, the ministry said. Putin illegally annexed Kherson, as well as the neighboring Zaporizhzhia region and the Donetsk and Luhansk regions of eastern Ukraine last month following ""referendums"" in the four regions that Kyiv and the West denounced as a sham. A Ukrainian soldier looks out from a tank, amid Russia's invasion of Ukraine, in the frontline city of Lyman, Donetsk region, Ukraine April 28, 2022. Gen. Valeriy Zaluzhny, the commander of Ukraine's armed forces, vowed Friday that his forces would succeed in ""getting ours back."" ""No one and nothing will stop us,"" Zaluzhny said in a video message. ""We have buried the myth of the invincibility of the Russian army."" While reiterating calls for local residents to evacuate to Russia, Saldo's deputy, Kirill Stremousov, also insisted the evacuation preparations did not mean the Russian-installed officials anticipated Ukrainian forces taking all of the Kherson region. ""No one’s retreating. ... No one is planning to leave the territory of the Kherson region,"" he said. , ' ' For a fifth day, Russia continued missile strikes on critical infrastructure that started Monday in retaliation for an explosion on the Kerch Bridge last weekend that Moscow has said was caused by a truck bomb. The span, which links Crimea to the Russian mainland, holds important strategic and symbolic value to Russia in its faltering war in Ukraine. In the last 24 hours, at least nine civilians were killed and 15 were wounded, the Ukrainian president’s office reported Friday morning. The victims included an 11-year-old boy and six other people who died after a missile strike in the city of Mykolaiv, where a residential building was destroyed, the regional governor, Vitaliy Kim, said. Russian forces on Friday carried out at least four missile strikes on Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second- largest city. Mayor Ihor Terekhov reported several explosions in the northeastern city without offering any details on the extent of the damage or saying if there were any casualties. The Ukrainian army recaptured most previously occupied areas of the Kharkiv region, which includes the city of the same name, during a fierce counteroffensive last month that forced Russian troops to withdraw and inflicted a stunning blow on Moscow’s military prestige. Armed National Guard servicemen walk along a trench at one of the sections of a defence line outside Kharkiv, Kharkiv Region, northeastern Ukraine. This photo cannot be distributed in the Russian Federation. The region's governor, Oleh Syniehubov, urged residents not to ignore air raid sirens and to get to bomb shelters. Earlier Russian strikes on Thursday night cut off the electricity in the regional capital, which had a pre-war population of 1.4 million. Multiple Russian missile strikes shook the city of Zaphorizhzhia overnight. The capital of the annexed region remains in Ukrainian hands and has come under repeated bombardment as Ukraine pushes its southern counteroffensive. Several explosions were reported overnight at infrastructure facilities, causing fires, regional Gov, Oleksandr Starukh said. There were no victims in preliminary reports, and further details about specific damage were unavailable. Starukh told Ukrainian state television that Russian soldiers remained unable to enter the city but their ""missiles remind us of the evil and grief that the army of the occupiers carries."" : In addition to the missile strikes on the regional capital, there was also shelling in three cities closer to the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant. In Nikopol, Marhanets, Chervonohryhorivka, drone and artillery strikes destroyed residential buildings and damaged water supply and power lines. The regional capital is about 100 miles by road from the plant, the largest nuclear power plant in Europe. Two days ago, it was forced to revert to diesel-fueled generator power to maintain its reactor cooling systems after an Russian missile attack on distant electrical substation. Friday is Defender’s Day in Ukraine, but celebrations were muted because of the war. In Kyiv, a concert at the central opera house was canceled because of planned, rotating power outages across the city as repairs to the city’s energy infrastructure continue following Russia's wide-ranging missile attacks. Missile, drone and rocket attacks on Ukraine have kept the country on edge with air raid sirens occurring more frequently and bringing a heightened sense of urgency after Monday’s strike killed 19 people and wounded more than 100, including many in the capital. Emergency service personnel attend to the site of a blast next to a childrens playground in a park on October 10, 2022 in Kyiv, Ukraine. This morning's explosions, which came shortly after 8:00 local time, were the largest such attacks in the capital in months. Putin has vowed to retaliate harshly if Ukraine or its allies strike Russian territory, including the annexed regions of Ukraine. Russian officials reported Friday that Ukrainian shelling blew up an ammunition depot in Russia’s Belgorod region on the border with Ukraine. An unspecified number of people were killed and wounded in the incident, according to Russia’s Investigative Committee. Unconfirmed media reports said three Russian National Guard officers were killed and more than 10 were wounded. The Kerch Bridge explosion temporarily halted rail and road traffic on the 12-mile span, undermining a vital supply route for the Kremlin’s forces. The Russian government said Friday that repairs were scheduled to be completed by July 2023.

The Russian cybercriminal group KillNet struck the websites of multiple U.S. airports with distributed denial-of-service attacks, taking them off-line temporarily on Monday. On Tuesday, Killnet claimed another cyberattack, blocking the entire network infrastructure of the largest U.S. bank, organ. A spokesperson for the bank said that no operations were impacted, without denying that its networks were compromised by a cyber intrusion. Across the Atlantic, Russia unleashed a barrage of missile and drone strikes throughout Ukraine in an apparent escalation of it seven-month war against its post-Soviet neighbor. Russian cyberstrikes on the U.S. homeland are almost certainly part of Putin’s shift in strategy, expanding Russia’s offensive operations beyond the actual battlefield in Ukraine and into the cyber domain. This week’s cyber intrusions may have been Putin’s ""shot across the bow,"" signaling to Washington that Russia possesses the capability to inflict devastating damage. White House spokesman John Kirby’s statement that it is too soon to know if Kremlin was behind the cyberstrikes on U.S. airports is naïve. It is a false distinction whether a Russian government employee or a KillNet hacker pulled the cyber trigger. Russian intelligence routinely hires cybercriminals to do its dirty work, to ensure plausible deniability. : , ' ,' ', , , 911' A hand on the keyboard is seen with binary code displayed on a laptop screen in this illustration photo taken in Krakow, Poland on Aug. 17, 2021. Moscow believes that in Ukraine, Russia is fighting a proxy war with the Washington, given that the U.S. government has been providing top-of-the-line weaponry and other support to Kyiv that has dramatically enhanced Ukraine’s warfighting capabilities. On Tuesday, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov remarked that the United States is ""de facto"" a participant in Ukraine war, probably signaling that Russia believes it is justified in targeting the U.S., albeit non-kinetically. Moscow’s goal is to place psychological pressure on Americans by gradually destabilizing the normal functioning of the society via cyber strikes, in order to persuade us to abandon support for Ukraine. The Russians view cyber as a low-cost, flexible, non-kinetic tool capable of dialing the pain inflicted on the opponent up and down, until it reaches the threshold of ""unacceptable damage."" Russian military planners have concluded that a direct war between Russia and the U.S. is inevitable, given that two have been in confrontation over the control of the post-Soviet states bordering Russia, the area that Moscow views as its sphere of influence and security perimeter – that is, its version of the Monroe Doctrine. 'S , 'S - Fearing Washington's conventional superiority, Russian strategists conceptualized a cyberwarfare doctrine, which they believe would allow them to exploit American’s reliance on technology both in daily life and in military operations. Russia has studied our vulnerabilities and has already practiced conducting cyber intrusions into our networks and computer systems for two decades. A previously highly classified cyber multi-year Russian cyber operation code named by U.S. investigators as ""Moonlight Maze"" dates back to 1999. In it, the Russians breached multiple U.S. government and military agencies, including weapons labs, and exfiltrated massive amounts of sensitive data. The Russians have compromised the networks of many sectors of the economy and countless government agencies, including the White House, the State Department and the Pentagon. Russia is considered by U.S. intelligence to be the most formidable foreign cyber actor, with a flexible arsenal capable of producing carefully tailored effects. The attacks of the airport websites on Monday did not affect the systems that handle air traffic control, internal airline communications and transportation security, causing only a temporary inconvenience. Russia’s ransomware attack on the Colonial Pipeline, a critical part of U.S. petroleum infrastructure, supplying around half of the East Coast’s fuel, did more damage. The six-day shutdown of the pipeline, which transports 2.5 million barrels per day of gasoline, diesel fuel, heating oil and jet fuel, resulted in gas shortages, outages at gas stations, price hikes, long lines, and panicking consumers. Similarly, Russia’s ransomware attack on , which processes one-fifth of the nation’s meat supply, raised the issue of food security and affordability. Putin, in the wake of Biden's comments, says Russia knows ""how to defend our own interests."" The most destructive cyber weapon is a computer worm capable of taking over programmable systems of critical infrastructure. The Russians have been mapping out access to U.S. critical infrastructure facilities and conducting proof-of-concept operations, as part of what is called in the intelligence business ""cyber preparation of the battlefield."" However, even carefully planned cyber operation of this complexity can get out of control and spill over into unintended targets, resulting in cascading impact and wreaking havoc across global cyberspace. As we saw in the case of Stuxnet, a U.S.-Israeli computer worm that was covertly deployed to a uranium enrichment facility in Iran to sabotage and slow down the Iranian nuclear program. Although Stuxnet achieved its mission of destroying numerous centrifuges in Iran’s Natanz uranium enrichment facility by causing them to burn themselves out, the virus mutated and spread to other ""supervisory control and data acquisition,"" or , systems installed in similar power plants, infecting other energy-producing facilities and wreaking havoc all over the world. As the first known computer virus that actually crippled hardware, Stuxnet was a ""game changer"" in cyber warfare, earning respect from cybersecurity researchers and instilling fear in governments, including the Kremlin. It is unclear if Russia has a Stuxnet-like capability, but the Kremlin took careful note of it. Capitalizing on spying tools believed to have been developed by the U.S. National Security Agency, hackers staged a cyber assault with a self-spreading malware that has infected tens of thousands of computers in nearly 100 countries. Since at least March 2016, six of the 16 sectors designated by the Department of Homeland Security as critical have been penetrated by the Russians, including energy, water, aviation, commercial facilities, critical manufacturing and nuclear facilities. In June 2018, top Trump administration officials were advised that the threat to the U.S. electric grid was so serious, that the country needed to prepare for a catastrophic power outage, possibly caused by a cyberattack. Following Russia’s attacks on U.S. airports on Monday, the director of the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency , warned about ""potential attacks on U.S. critical infrastructure,"" remarking that the ""Russians are very unpredictable"" and ""their back is up against the wall."" On Thursday released twenty-five advisories, flagging current security vulnerabilities and exploits surrounding our Industrial Control Systems and providing mitigation recommendations. In the first recorded cyberattack on a power grid outside a military conflict, Russia temporarily shut down Ukraine’s power grid in a crippling operation during Christmas of 2015, causing a blackout for 250,000 people in freezing temperatures. Putin will almost certainly not resort to launch a similarly debilitating attack on the U.S. homeland in peacetime. However, if Moscow and Washington are indeed in a direct kinetic war, and especially if Putin is cornered and facing defeat, unleashing Cyber Armageddon is an integral part of Putin’s Playbook.",3,6.49934673660941,5.901724793683903,0.5976219429255067,9

According to Russian milbloggers, one commander from the 58th Combined Arms Army of the Southern Military District, Mikhail Zusko, apparently ordered the ""immediate deployment without any pre-combat training of newly mobilized servicemen."" These conscripts were sent to fight for the 15th Regiment in 27th Motor Rifle Brigade in one of the most brutal warfronts in Ukraine near the city of Svatove in Luhansk. Milbloggers reported that half of this regiment was later found by relatives at a Russian hospital in the Belgorod Oblast, roughly 40 miles from Ukraine, after the unit came under heavy fire when attempting to reach the frontline near Svatove.

Surovikin's appointment represents the first time Russian troops in Ukraine will all answer to a single commander. The general first gained notoriety in 1991 for ordering Russian soldiers to fire on protesting civilians in Moscow in the final months of the Soviet Union. He displayed similar brutality when Putin deployed him to Syria in 2017, allegedly ordering the indiscriminate bombings of Aleppo and other anti-government strongholds. Surovikin has also been accused of complicity in the use of chemical weapons in Syria. Surovikin has been imprisoned in Russia twice over his career, once for selling weapons and again for ordering the shooting of civilians in Moscow, according to the Guardian.

He drove a vehicle through pro-democracy barricades in the Capital and ordered his soldiers to fire on civilians, killing three people. Yevgeny Prigozhin, the founder of the Wagner private military company, praised Putin's decision to appoint Surovikin this weekend. ""Surovikin is the most able commander in the Russian army,"" Prigozhin said, according to the Guardian. ""He was born to serve his motherland faithfully. Having received an order in 1991, Surovikin was that officer who without hesitation got in his tank and went forward to save his country."" ‘’ Intelligence experts have warned that Surovikin's appointment could also signal that Putin is moving one step closer to ordering the use of tactical nuclear weapons. The decision to use such weapons would have vast consequences for Russia, and Putin would need to have commanders on the ground willing to carry out the order. ""So they have already signaled their intent, but they would need commanders who would have the capability to do it,"" Military analyst and head of McKenzie Intelligence Forbes McKenzie told Sky News.

Surovikin previously held command of the Southern group in June and Commander-in-Chief of the Russian Aerospace Forces in 2017.

Shortly before the vote in Geneva, Russian human rights group Memorial was named a co-winner of the 2022 Nobel Peace Prize. The original proposal expressed concerns about ""mass forced shutdowns"" of independent media, non-governmental organizations and opposition groups in Russia. 70, The Human Rights Council majority agreed to name a ""special rapporteur"" to keep tabs on rights violations in Russia, in part by relying on help from Russian groups and activists who are both still in the country and abroad. It's the first time the council has authorized a special rapporteur to look into human rights issues in any of the five countries that are permanent members of the U.N. Security Council: Britain, China, France, Russia and the United States. Russian ambassador Gennady Gatilov called the draft proposal a ""despicable document"" that was intended ""to find yet another way of exerting leverage for bringing pressure to bear on Russia."" Russian ambassador Gennady Gatilov, seen here speaking at the Human Rights Council in Geneva, Switzerland, on, Feb. 28, 2022, has spoken out against the U.N.'s plans to further increase scrutiny on Russia for their actions in Ukraine.

Western countries provided most of the votes in favor, joined by Paraguay, Marshall Islands and Ukraine. Diplomats from Bolivia, China, Cuba, Eritrea, Kazakhstan and Venezuela voted against the proposal. The number of abstentions in part reflected hesitations about authorizing a special rapporteur for a country that opposed the initiative: It's unlikely that Russia will let the special rapporteur to visit the country.

The blasts came hours after Russia concentrated attacks in its increasingly troubled invasion of Ukraine on areas it illegally annexed, while the death toll from earlier missile strikes on apartment buildings in the southern city of Zaporizhzhia rose to 14.

An accident there could release 10 times more potentially lethal radiation than the world’s worst nuclear disaster at Chernobyl in Ukraine 36 years ago, Ukrainian Environmental Protection Minister Ruslan Strilets said Friday. ""The situation with the occupation, shelling, and mining of the Chernobyl and Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plants by Russian troops is causing consequences that will have a global character,"" Strilets told The Associated Press.

The city of Zaporizhzhia is located 53 kilometers away from the nuclear plant as a crow flies and remains under Ukrainian control. To cement Russia's claim to the region, Russian forces bombarded the city with S-300 missiles on Thursday, with more attacks reported Friday. Ukrainian authorities said the death toll from the strikes on apartment buildings rose to 14 on Friday, while 12 people wounded in the bombardment remained hospitalized. 70, Missiles also struck the city overnight, wounding one person, Zaporizhzhia Gov. Oleksandr Starukh said. Russia also used Iranian-made Shahed-136 drones there for the first time and damaged two infrastructure facilities, he said. With its army losing ground to a Ukrainian counteroffensive in the south and east, Russia has deployed unmanned, disposable Iranian-made drones that are cheaper and less sophisticated than missiles but still can damage ground targets. The Washington-based Institute for the Study of War said Russia's use of the explosives-packed drones was unlikely to affect the course of the war.

""Dead bodies smell the same everywhere,"" special operations Marine veteran Chad Robichaux said, describing the grizzly sight he witnessed this week. ""The distinct smell of decaying people.

Some 1,100 Ukrainian men, women and children, many with their hands bound behind their backs, were reportedly found in several pits roughly 20 feet by 30 feet that had been originally dug out to hide Russian tanks. ""They tried to burn the evidence of the bodies,"" Robichaux said. ""But they didn’t do a very good job of it.

Russian forces have largely retreated from areas surrounding Izyum in southeast Kharkiv, but Robichaux explained that doesn’t mean Russian soldiers are no longer a threat. ""Just because Ukraine retakes control of an area doesn’t mean that equates to no Russians,"" he said. Robichaux described a chaotic scene and said he and his team were with Ukrainian forces on the front lines where attacks by Russian forces overhead and on the ground remain a very real threat. At least 60 deceased Russian soldiers were found this week as they continued to advance in the area, along with 15 Russian troops who surrendered. Reports of Russia’s inability to maintain command and control in its ranks have emerged in the weeks following Ukraine’s major counteroffensive, and, according to Robichaux, these issues stem from a lack of basic communication among Russia’s soldiers. ""They don't have inner team communications like we would normally have, so they have no way to communicate,"" he said adding they do not appear well-trained or even know how to navigate. ""They're just lost and walking around. Almost like they have to get picked up because they wouldn't survive."" Robichaux described the harsh dichotomy of war and said the Russian soldiers he’s seen were not only under-trained but young and ""terrified.""

The International Criminal Court and several nations, including the U.S. and its European allies, have opened investigations into the alleged war crimes. But the special ops veteran argued the West should be doing more to help Ukraine win this war more efficiently and faster. ""Bullies don't stop bullying until somebody walks across the playground and punches him in the face,"" he said. ""It's a problem that won't go away until somebody draws a line and does something about it.

Lithuania's president, Gitanas Nauseda, had said that Russia’s war in Ukraine was ""unjustified, unprovoked and illegal"" and a ""gross violation of international law"" during his address to the United Nations General Assembly last week, but Foreign Minister Gabrielius Landsbergis emphasized that the country was not worried about Russian ramifications for the comments. ""The whole U.N. General Assembly was at least partially devoted to Russia's unjustified and illegal war in Ukraine. So, if Russia wanted to retaliate, it would have to choose a lot of enemies and a lot of targets just for the words,"" Landsbergis said in an interview with Fox News Digital. : ? Gabrielius Landsbergis, foreign minister of Lithuania, attends the Baltic Sea Council in Kristiansand, Norway, on May 25, 2022. Lithuania was one of many countries that spoke out against Russia’s aggression during the global event, including President Biden and Japanese Prime Minister Kishida Fumio, who both called out Russia for violating the U.N. charter in its attack against Ukraine. The threat of a nuclear disaster or use of nuclear force by Russia has loomed over the war in Ukraine, with Russian President Vladimir Putin saying last week that his country would use ""all the means at our disposal"" and the threat to resort to nuclear weapons is ""not a bluff."" : ‘ A ’ Given the gravity of the Russian threat, Landsbergis called on to be ""very clear about the possibility of response in case … nuclear weapons are being used."" ""It does not necessarily have to be a nuclear response. But I think that we possess a number of possible responses that would not escalate the conflict further but yet … give a very clear answer,"" he said. Russian President Vladimir Putin warned that the threat of nuclear weapons being used is ""not a bluff."" But even without the use of nuclear weapons, Russia has the capability to create a nuclear disaster in Eastern Europe. ""We have to remember that Vladimir Putin already possesses a nuclear power plant in the occupied territory in Ukraine, which can be used as a weapon. So, it also is a worry for … many neighbors close to Ukraine, for many countries too close to Ukraine,"" he said. 'S ‘,’ : Gitanas Nauseda, president of Lithuania, speaks during the U.N. Climate Change Conference in Glasgow, Scotland, on Nov. 2, 2021. Russian forces captured the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in Ukraine earlier this year, and the site remains near the front lines of the conflict, raising safety concerns over the potential for nuclear disaster. While much of the United Nations General Assembly focused on Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, climate change remained a significant topic, and Landsbergis said the world could not ""afford to lose sight of either."" ""Unfortunately, this is sometimes how crises work. They do come in waves,"" he said, adding that had been a third, simultaneous crisis. : Landsbergis also warned of the ""vast array of coercion instruments"" China is willing to use against countries around the world. In 2021, Lithuania became the first state to withdraw from the Cooperation between China and Central and Eastern European Countries initiative, led by Beijing. The country also made the decision to allow Taiwan to open a representative office in the Lithuanian capital of Vilnius. In retaliation, China enacted a series of economic embargoes and sanctions against Lithuania. ""What happened to Lithuania can happen in any country, Europe, Indo-Pacific, wherever,"" Landsbergis warned.

""We need to keep the pressure on them,"" Yuriy Sak, adviser to Ukraine’s defense minister, told Fox News Digital. ""If we allow them time to recuperate, if we allow them time to rebuild their capacity, then it will be more possible for them to strike back. ""We need to keep the momentum, and we need to keep going,"" he added, noting that the momentum must also continue to come in the way of international arms if Ukraine is going to be successful. Ukrainian forces have taken back nearly the entire northern region of Kharkiv, liberating more than 400 towns and cities and forcing Russian troops to withdraw. , The advances in Ukraine’s north were part of a long-awaited counteroffensive — first alluded to in mid-May — that also included an offensive push in Ukraine’s southern region. Ukrainian forces are seen in Izyum after Russian forces withdrew from the city in Kharkiv Oblast, Ukraine, on Sept. 16, 2022. But even Kyiv was surprised by its success in Kharkiv, where it managed to take Russian forces by surprise and force them to hastily retreat, in some cases back across Russia’s own borders. ""This was a mission that for a good reason was kept secret for a long time,"" Sak said. ""The outcome of this counteroffensive actually exceeded even our own expectations."" The adviser said it was not only the amount of territory that exceeded Kyiv’s imagination but the success rate of the mission. ‘ ,’ Sak claimed that for every Ukrainian soldier killed in the counteroffensive, somewhere between ""9 to 10"" Russian soldiers were killed. Reports have since surfaced suggesting there was a breakdown in command and control in Russia’s ranks as it withdrew from Kharkiv, prompting its soldiers to abandon not only military equipment but their own troops. Sak said that Ukrainian defense officials had also received word that in an attempt to withdraw faster, Russian troops left behind soldiers killed in action and at times shot their own wounded, though he said these accounts still need to be confirmed. Ukrainian troops retook a wide swath of territory from Russia on Monday, pushing all the way back to the northeastern border in some places, and claimed to have captured many Russian soldiers as part of a lightning advance that forced Moscow to make a hasty retreat. : ""The Ukrainian army has had tremendous success,"" he said. ""They know what they're fighting for. They want to win this war."" But Western officials have said it is too early to say if Ukraine’s ability to recapture some 3,300 square miles is a turning point or whether Russia has another operational ploy up its weathered sleeve. ""We're not fully aware of what they're capable of in this state of desperation — in which they definitely are in now,"" the adviser said. ""We have to be prepared for everything. Again, this brings us back to the issue of haste and speed. ""They are learning from their own mistakes,"" he continued. ""From a purely logical point of view, it is possible to assume that the next stages will be accompanied by a more sophisticated response."" Sak said Ukrainian defense officials are relying heavily on intelligence to determine their offensive strategy and would not guess at what Russia might do next. ""Our plan is simple: to keep fighting until we win this war,"" he added. Ukrainian soldiers sit on infantry fighting vehicles as they advance near Izyum in eastern Ukraine on Sept. 16, 2022. Sak pointed out that as Ukrainian forces were gaining in Kharkiv, Russia increasingly relied on hitting civilian targets and using ""missile terror"" in areas like the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. Ukraine continues to ask for greater air defense like anti-rocket systems, fourth-generation aircraft and longer-range missile systems. But the White House has not yet agreed to these big ticket items. ""We can be as successful as the amount of weapons that we receive,"" he said. ""We understand that this war is far from over.""",14,1.7986935507561876,1.618489647035527,0.18020390372066064,22

Alex Drueke, 40, and Andy Huynh, 27, went missing in the Kharkiv region of northeastern Ukraine near the Russian border June 9. Both had traveled to Ukraine on their own and became friends because both are from Alabama. The families announced their release in a joint statement from Dianna Shaw, an aunt of Drueke. ""They are safely in the custody of the U.S. embassy in Saudi Arabia and after medical checks and debriefing they will return to the states,"" the statement said. Shaw said both men have spoken with relatives and are in ""pretty good shape,"" according to an official with the U.S. embassy. The Saudi embassy released a statement saying it helped secure the release of 10 prisoners from Morocco, the United States, the United Kingdom, Sweden and Croatia. Shaw confirmed that Drueke and Huynh were part of the group. The United Kingdom said five British nationals had been released, and lawmaker Robert Jenrick said one of them was Aiden Aslin, 28, who had been sentenced to death after he was captured in eastern Ukraine. ""Aiden’s return brings to an end months of agonising uncertainty for Aiden’s loving family in Newark who suffered every day of Aiden’s sham trial but never lost hope. As they are united as a family once more, they can finally be at peace,"" Jenrick tweeted. British Prime Minister Liz Truss heralded the release on social media. ""Hugely welcome news that five British nationals held by Russian-backed proxies in eastern Ukraine are being safely returned, ending months of uncertainty and suffering for them and their families,"" she tweeted. U.S. military veterans Andy Huynh, left, and Alexander Drueke who disappeared while fighting Russia with Ukrainian forces on June 9, 2022, have been released after about three months in captivity. Russian state television had previously said Drueke and Huynh were being held by Russian-backed separatist forces in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine. The U.S. does not recognize the sovereignty of the Donetsk People’s Republic and has no diplomatic relations with them, which made it necessary for others to lead efforts to get the men released. Drueke joined the Army at age 19 after the terror attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, and he believed he could help Ukrainian fighters because of his training and experience with weapons, Shaw said previously. Drueke left in mid-April. Druke's mother received a call from Saudi Arabia on Wednesday morning and an embassy worker handed the phone to the man, Shaw said. ""He got on the phone and said, ‘Hi mom, it’s your favorite child,’"" she said. Huynh moved to north Alabama two years ago from his native California and lives about 120 miles from Drueke. Before leaving for Europe, Huynh told his local newspaper, The Decatur Daily, he couldn’t stop thinking about Russia’s invasion. ""I know it wasn’t my problem, but there was that gut feeling that I felt I had to do something,"" Huynh told the paper. ""Two weeks after the war began, it kept eating me up inside and it just felt wrong. I was losing sleep. ... All I could think about was the situation in Ukraine."" Huynh told his fiance he wants a meal from McDonald's and a Pepsi-Cola when he returns home, Shaw said. ’S",13,2.2221532257695054,2.7742626561115387,-0.5521094303420333,23

Russian pundits are openly questioning Russian President Vladimir Putin's war in Ukraine after Ukrainian forces handed the country a stunning defeat last week. Ukraine's military swept away Russia's forces in the northeast Kharkiv region with a surprise counteroffensive that lasted through the weekend. Former member of Russian parliament Boris Nadezhdin declared that it was ""impossible"" for Russia to beat back the Ukrainian offensive during a Monday appearance on Russian state . ""We're now at the point when we have to understand it's absolutely impossible to defeat Ukraine using those resources and colonial war methods with which Russia is trying to wage war, using contract soldiers, mercenaries, no mobilization,"" Nadezhdin said. He went on to protect Putin from any criticism, however, stating that Russia's leader must have been misinformed by advisors. ""The president didn't just sit there and think, why don't I start a special operation. Someone told him that Ukrainians will surrender, that they will flee, that they'll want to join Russia. Someone had to be telling him all this,"" he added. A tank of Ukrainian Army advances to the fronts in the northeastern areas of Kharkiv, Ukraine on September 08, 2022.

Russian police arrested five people who proposed officials arrest and charge Vladimir Putin with treason for his decision to launch the invasion of Ukraine, which has led to catastrophic outcomes for Russia and its interests. ""The fact that several municipal deputies in St. Petersburg, Putin’s hometown, came forward accusing [him] of treason and calling for his removal is highly significant,"" Rebekah Koffler, a former intelligence officer and author of ""Putin’s Playbook,"" told Fox News Digital. ""They know the punishment will be severe. They can easily face a death sentence based on Russian federal law. The significance of this act of defiance and dissent by a handful of Russian officials cannot be possibly overstated."" The deputies appealed to the central governing body known as the Duma to punish Putin for countless deaths of military personnel, prompting economic sanctions from other nations, motivating to expand and leading Ukraine to build its military power. 'S Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered Russia’s all-out invasion of Ukraine only eight months after magazine billed President Biden as ready to take on the Russian leader. Their first point is that the president is blamed for the loss of the army, according to Russian newspaper Kommersant. The second problem is the economy. The deputies point to the withdrawal of investors from Russia and the ""brain drain.""

If Ukraine can maintain that momentum, it could revive pressure among officials to take action and change the fortunes of Russia, according to Koffler. , ""It is possible they decided to risk their lives in order to build momentum among the Russian people to oust Putin, which is an incredibly difficult thing to do because Putin has surrounded himself with loyal security and intelligence operatives,"" Koffler explained. ""Even two months ago, I would say that a coup in Russia is unlikely. Ukrainian servicemen fire a towed howitzer in eastern Ukraine. ""Today, with Ukraine’s counter-offensive gaining steam and Russia having become as much of a pariah as North Korea, I don’t rule out the possibility of a regime change organized from within."" Koffler noted that the death of Mikhail Gorbachev may have prompted this act of defiance. Gorbachev played a role in repairing relations between the Soviet Union and the United States, and his funeral drew thousands of Russians to mourn him despite Putin’s attempt to downplay the significance by ruling out a full state funeral and not even appearing at the funeral himself.

A young Russian journalist travels to Ukraine to try to find evidence of war crimes committed by the armed forces of her own country. With the help of social media, Ekaterina Fomina tracked down a couple of soldiers from a battalion that killed and looted in one village. One young soldier admitted to her that he killed a Ukrainian civilian with a bullet to the head. His confession came after a long phone conversation with the reporter about everything - but the killing. Later, he messaged her. ""Call me back on video. Record it,"" the solider told Fomina. The Russian soldier then ultimately admits in clear language to having killed a Ukrainian civilian. Fomina of ""Important Stories"" believes the twenty-one-year-old soldier she spoke with, a young man identified as Daniil Frolkin from one of Russia's poorest regions who signed a contract before the war he was told was never happening, probably could not live with what he had done, what he had seen and had to tell his story. : ’S ""After this conversation, he said, ‘I feel something like post-traumatic syndrome.’ He never knew term for the condition, but called it something like this. It was absolutely impossible to keep his information inside,"" Fomina tells Fox News. ""I was the first person who showed interest in his life, and what's going on with him…how did he feel at that moment? Maybe this why he was so open with me."" A mass grave in Bucha, Ukraine May 30th, 2022 The soldier did not express remorse, according to Fomina. She said he was convinced the man he killed in Andriivka, a city outside Kyiv, had called in information to the Ukrainian army about Russian positions, which led to the death of his colleagues, though that suspicion not confirmed. Additonally, he claims he was given order from above to shoot. Still, the unarmed victim, believed to be 47-year-old Ruslan Yermechuk, was reportedly put on his knees and shot in the head at close range. The soldier who confessed to this murder in that phone call ultimately appeared more eager to indict his commanders than express personal guilt, according to Fomina. He told her the war seemed pointless, he saw no Nazis in Ukraine and complained that his commanders gave the men in the field zero support. He added the commanders dispensed those orders to kill and they themselves were part of the looting that has become famous for being one of the most common criminal activities carried out by Russian soldiers in Ukraine. According to Fomina, Frolkin somehow seemed to think that by confessing to what he did and what is really going on, he could save his comrades. - A war crimes prosecutor examines the damage in a destroyed building, as Russia's attack on Ukraine continues, following shelling in Mykolaiv, Ukraine, in this handout picture released on July 31, 2022. Reuters Fomina believes the fate of the soldier will likely end in some sort of punishment. He is sought by Ukraine for war crimes, and Russia will likely want him silenced. However, Istories says it has been contacted by that soldier’s colleagues, who reportedly insist the tales of abuses and description of reality Frolkin gave are true. One of the anonymous soldiers who reached out to Istories to confirm Frolkin's story reportedly said he believes 80% of the team wants to quit, but in many cases are not allowed to. Reportedly, though legally they have the right to terminate contracts since war has not officially been declared, soldiers are routinely verbally or physically threatened when they say they want out. 10,000 Additionally this month—the first soldier to publicly discredit the war and flee Russia in fear for his life—had spoken out at length. Pavel Filatyev of the 56th Guards air assault published his damning and lengthy memoirs written from the trenches on the Russian version of Facebook, ontakte. He told The Guardian newspaper earlier this month, ""I am not afraid to fight in war. But I need to feel justice, to understand what I’m doing is right. And I believe that this is all failing not only because the government has stolen everything, but because we, Russians, don’t feel that what we are doing is right."" Filatyev, among the first deployed to Ukraine to fight back in February, claimed it took him weeks to understand that Russia had not been attacked and that Russia had just attacked Ukraine. Filatyev told the Guardian he is not only worried for his only personal security, but for the future of Russia. ""What have we become? And how can it get any worse?""He escaped Russia after going public with his book and is now in hiding. Russian military and pro-Russian separatists keep watch as civilians are being evacuated along humanitarian corridors from the Ukrainian city of Mariupol on March 24, 2022. For her part, Fomina says she and her team thought long and hard about publishing their story of the soldier who confessed to her and who criticized the war and his commanders. He claimed he was prepared for consequences as yet are unclear and is back in Russia. Fomina hopes he will have to answer for what he has done, but worries this may end up happening in an extra-judicial way which she would not want to see. But in the end, she and her colleagues felt it was vital to release their expose. ""If even one future soldier would be stopped by our investigation from signing a contract and going to this absolutely bloody war, then our purpose will be reached. We really hope our documentary will stop young guys from deploying to this absolutely cruel war.""",13,5.45317741623176,5.3370831419060245,0.11609427432573582,17

Russian President Vladimir Putin's forces have encountered unexpectedly stiff Ukrainian resistance in their invasion and abandoned their effort to storm the capital in the spring. The fighting has turned into a slog that has reduced neighborhoods to rubble and sent shock waves through the world economy. On the battlefield, Russian forces struck several towns and villages in Donetsk province in the east over 24 hours, killing one person, authorities said. A building materials superstore in the city of Donetsk was hit by a shell and erupted in flames, the mayor said. There were no immediate reports of any injuries. In the Dnipropetrovsk region, the Russians again shelled the cities of Nikopol and Marhanets, damaging several buildings and wounding two people, authorities said. Russian troops also shelled the city of Zaporizhzhia, but no casualties were reported. Also, Russian rockets struck unspecified targets in the Khmelnytskyi region, about 180 miles west of Kyiv, the regional governor said. Attacks there have been infrequent.

Two Russians and a Ukrainian citizen have been arrested for alleged espionage at Çekin Military Plant, an arms manufacturing plant in southern Albania, the Albanian Defense Ministry said late Saturday. The first Russian suspect — a 24-year-old man identified only as M.Z. — was detained after entering the plant’s grounds in Gramsh, about 50 miles south of the capital, Tirana, and taking photos, the ministry said in a statement. Two military guards were injured by a ""neo-paralyzing spray"" used by the Russians while resisting arrest, according to the ministry. They were taken to a military hospital for medical care.

""These fireworks mean that Crimea is coming back to Ukraine,"" Serhiy Bratchuk, the spokesman for Odesa region’s military administration, told Britain's The Times newspaper this week. The comments come as multiple explosions have rocked Russian bases in occupied Crimea over the last week, destroying ammunition and damaging logistics and communications lines. Kyiv has not officially taken credit for the attacks, though Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and military leaders have hinted in recent days that the explosions could be part of their planned offensive. ' ' - Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy attends a meeting with military officials during his visit to the war-hit Dnipropetrovsk region on July 8, 2022. ""Although Ukraine hasn’t officially claimed responsibility, Ukraine’s President Zelenskyy previously has warned about the counteroffensive being planned for August-September, and he and his top adviser, Mykhailo Podolyak, hinted about Ukraine’s involvement in the recent explosions,"" Rebekah Koffler, a former intelligence officer and the author of ""Putin’s Playbook: Russia’s Secret Plan to Defeat America,"" told Fox News Digital. Ukraine's ability to strike deep behind Russian lines would be a blow to Moscow, where leaders have so far denied that the attacks were the result of a coordinated Ukrainian effort. The Russian military has said the explosions were an act of ""sabotage"" and has also pinned blame on Hizb ut-Tahrir al-Islami, an Islamic terrorist cell. The Russian spy agency claimed on Wednesday that forces ""neutralized"" the six-member cell behind the attack, but Ukraine has hinted that more attacks are coming. Speaking to the Washington Post on Wednesday, Ukraine’s Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov said Ukraine intends to keep hitting key targets deep inside Russian-held territory in the coming weeks. Smoke can be seen from the beach at Saki after explosions were heard from the direction of a Russian military airbase near Novofedorivka, Crimea, on Aug. 9, 2022. ""We’re using a strategy to ruin their stocks, to ruin their depots, to ruin their headquarters, commander quarters,"" he said. ""It’s our answer to their meat-grinder tactics."" Reznikov said that elements of Ukraine's special forces have been enlisting a ""resistance force"" that will be capable of hitting deep behind Russian lines, a strategy Ukrainian leaders hope will soften Russian defenses and deal a blow to morale ahead of a larger offensive. Ukraine still lacks enough weapons and ammunition to launch a full-scale offensive into Russian-held territory, something Reznikov hopes will be coming from western countries that have poured billions into the Ukrainian war effort. But there are some indications Moscow is growing more concerned about the security situation in Crimea, with Russian media outlets reporting that Black Sea Fleet commander Adm. Igor Osipov has been replaced by the order of Russian President Vladimir Putin amid the attacks on the occupied peninsula. Osipov, who has been in charge of the fleet since May 2019, will be replaced by Vice Adm. Viktor Sokolov.

Vladimir Osechkin says he studied law because he wanted to go into law enforcement. To be a good sheriff, he tells me. But after a few bad brushes with Russia's justice system — he says he was falsely accused of murder until police found the right man and then years later was shaken down when the car sales empire he built grew too big for its own Russian good — his plans changed. Both experiences he describes as terrifying and violent. Osechkin has since dedicated his life to exposing torture in Russian prisons. There is so much abuse, he says, that many inmates are finding the prospects of a bloody and uncertain future on the front lines of Ukraine appealing enough to take recruiters' bait as Russia's defense chiefs look to prisons to beef up the ranks of the army. ""Inside this 21st-century gulag, you can be humiliated, beaten, raped. You may be subjected to the most terrible bullying. Or you will be forced to work in the industrial zone. From 7 a.m. to 11 p.m., or at least more than twelve hours a day, with faulty, outdated equipment, and you run the risk of losing a hand or an eye,"" Osechkin tells Fox News from his home in France via Zoom. ""They want to leave the torture dungeons by any means. Many don't realize they are likely to be killed in a week or two."" Osechkin runs the human rights group Gulagu.net. He himself is said to be one of Russia's most wanted men for having circulated dramatic torture videos from a prison in Saratov and disseminating reports of discontent within the ranks of the , Russia's security services. ',' - File photo - A contrail left by a passenger plane is seen behind a Russian state flag as it passes over the Siberian city of Krasnoyarsk, August 7, 2014. Russia for its part has said it has a fraud case against Osechkin. Fraud charges in Russia many say are liberally used for anyone the Kremlin has in its crosshairs, like Alexei Navalny. Osechkin calls the active recruitment of Russian prisoners for work on the front lines of the war a cynical act. According to his sources — he gets tips from a range of people including prisoners' families — these efforts have been recently stepped up. The army wants sappers as the Russian military has lost quite a few and it takes many years to train de-miners up. Russia, according to Osechkin, is also looking for men to send out as a sort of bait for Ukrainian soldiers — to draw fire from them in order to help Russians trace and then attack their positions. Finally, Osechkin says, they are tapping convicted killers and others with violent records to form ""killer brigades"" to shoot, cut and maim ""the enemy."" - In this photo taken from video a view of a destroyed barrack at a prison in Olenivka, in an area controlled by Russian-backed separatist forces, eastern Ukraine, on July 29, 2022. Russia and Ukraine accused each other Friday of shelling a prison in a separatist region of eastern Ukraine, an attack that reportedly killed dozens of Ukrainian military prisoners who were captured after the fall of a southern port city of Mariupol in May. Osechkin says the number of takers of such offers dropped off at one point when inmates began wising up to the fact that they might be used as cannon fodder. He believes that prompted an infamous man sometimes called ""Putin's Chef"" to himself start making the rounds of prisons. This has not been confirmed, but Osechkin is not the only one who has heard the reports. The independent Mediazona outlet heard it from a few inmates. The ""chef"" is himself an ex-convict. Turned billionaire from involvement in many businesses from catering to running the mercenary group Wagner, which he incidentally denies, Yevgeny Prigozhin is said to be close to the Russian president. ""Apparently, like an ace, like a trump card, Putin pulled out Prigozhin and personally sent him to meetings with prisoners,"" Osechkin said, adding that Prigozhin could do an easy sell, saying something like, ""I myself was once in prison, and now I am recruiting you. I have become a hero of Russia and you also have a chance in Putin's current system, to climb the ladder, get rich."" Mediazona interviewed prisoners who allegedly heard Prigozhin offer them ""amnesty and money."" And in the meeting with recruiters, one inmate recalled being told ""we’re interested in murderers and burglars."" 'S , ' ' Police officers detain a demonstrator as people gather in front of the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation, in Moscow, Russia, Tuesday, Dec. 28, 2021. Russia’s Supreme Court has ruled that one of the country’s oldest and most prominent human rights organizations should be shut down. Meanwhile, Osechkin, beyond concerns that prisoners will be sent to their deaths on promises of good money, fame and honor or dreams of escaping. He also says he thinks the whole idea of telling the already violent — the murderers and burglars — to go take up arms again is wholly irresponsible and even reprehensible. ""Instead of correcting these people,"" Osechkin says, ""the prison system is taking their basest, most vicious sides and is using them for its own purposes. I think most of them will not come back. But those who survive and return to Russia will pose an increased danger to society,"" he says. I ask how all this information manages to find its way out of cells and over the barbed wires of Russia's prisons. ""Vladimir Putin and his people are trying to build a myth that he is omnipotent and they have a super-totalitarian system. In fact, this is a mafia system. And as in any mafia, people are primarily interested in money and corruption,"" he says, adding, that's not all. ""Many people within the system are against the war themselves. Hundreds of thousands of people work in the federal penitentiary system and not all of them love Putin. Not all of them respect Putin. And not all of them are ready to participate in crimes against humanity and war crimes.""",13,4.094824586306931,4.4791311984503785,-0.3843066121434475,5

Thousands of Russian troops posted west of Ukraine’s Dnieper River have found themselves in a vulnerable position as Ukrainian forces have blocked most eastern supply routes, the U.K. defense ministry said Saturday. British intelligence has assessed that two primary bridges in the occupied region of Kherson are now unusable for the transport of heavy military vehicles after Ukrainian precision strikes again targeted one of the crossings Wednesday.

Russian troops have since been forced to rely on pontoon bridges to transport men and supplies over the river that separates Ukraine’s southwestern regions from Crimea. ""Even if Russia manages to make significant repairs to the bridges, they will remain a key vulnerability,"" the U.K. defense ministry assessed. ""Ground resupply for the several thousand Russian troops on the west bank is almost certainly reliant on just two pontoon ferry crossing points.""

Climbing Russian casualties and reports suggesting that Russia is now looking to North Korea to aid its flagging troops raised eyebrows this week as some began to question whether Moscow would drag Pyongyang into its war in Ukraine. Russia expert and former intelligence officer in Russian doctrine and strategy for the Defense Intelligence Agency , Rebekah Koffler, threw cold water on these claims and said they were ""implausible."" ""The Russian propaganda machine could say that 100,000 North Korean volunteers would fight on behalf of Russia, just to scare the West, but in reality, it’s disinformation,"" she said in answer to questions from Fox News Digital. Following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the relationship between Russian President Vladimir Putin, left, and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has become closer. , Reports claiming that North Korea may send up to 100,000 soldiers to aid Russia’s campaign in Ukraine began to circulate on Western and Russian news sites this week after the pro-Kremlin Regnum News Agency released an article earlier this month suggesting as much. The article dated Aug. 2 said that ""North Korea, through diplomatic channels, made it clear that it is ready to help the [Luhansk People’s Republic] and [Donetsk People’s Republic] in strengthening defense[s]"" and ""is ready to transfer up to 100,000 of its soldiers."" ""Pyongyang will be able to transfer its tactical units to the Donbas,"" the article continued. The report never detailed whether the news outlet obtained the ""diplomatic channels"" referenced in the report but instead pointed to comments made by a Russian member of parliament who championed Pyongyang’s alleged willingness to help. North Korea in March backed Russia when it joined it and three other nations in voting against a United Nations General Assembly resolution that condemned Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine. But Koffler said Pyongyang’s support for Russian President Vladimir Putin does not mean the Kremlin chief would actually allow North Korea to send ground forces into Ukraine. ""Putin will never accept — it’s implausible,"" she said. ""Just think about the sheer scale of it."" North Korean soldiers march and shout slogans during a military parade marking the 105th birth anniversary of the country's founding father, Kim Il-sung, in Pyongyang, North Korea, on April 15, 2017. Apart from the fact that Russia and North Korea have not held joint combat training and Pyongyang hasn’t even seen active combat in decades, the logistics of such an alliance would prove tricky. ""The command-and-control aspect of it is impossible. They do not speak Russian,"" Koffler said in reference to the average North Korean soldier. ""How are they going to use Russian weapons systems?"" ""It would make more of a mess than it would help,"" she added. As Russian causalities in Ukraine continue to climb and Moscow continues to increase joint military drills with neighboring Belarus, some have become concerned Putin may add to his fighting force with the help of Minsk. But Koffler said North Korea does not pose the same threat to the war in Ukraine that Belarus does. ""Remember, Belarussians, Chechens, Buryats, anyone from the former Soviet Union speaks Russian,"" she said. ""They are more integrated. Not only do they have the same, what we call tactics, techniques and procedures, but doctrinally they are on the same page [in their] war-fighting doctrine."" Koffler said it is more likely that North Koreans could be used to assist Russia with its rebuilding efforts in eastern Ukraine if Moscow is successful in holding off Kyiv from retaking occupied territory. A soldier salutes from atop an armored vehicle during a military parade marking the 105th birth anniversary of the country's founding father, Kim Il-sung, in Pyongyang, on April 15, 2017. The Russia expert also suggested Moscow could be looking to Pyongyang to assist its forces with more advanced weaponry like the -25 — which outranges the U.S. — in the wake of Western arms supplies to Ukraine. ""That is the real value added from North Korea that Putin would approve and is plausible,"" Koffler said.",14,3.4734973410133287,2.707350645667229,0.7661466953460998,21

Russia is looking to bolster its ground forces fighting in Ukraine by creating a new ground force of volunteer recruits as its casualty count climbs, the U.K.’s defense ministry said Wednesday. In an intelligence update defense officials said Moscow is raising volunteer recruits from across the country to join Russia’s new 3rd Army Corps which will be based east of Moscow in city of Mulino.

Russia’s newest army corps has been opened to volunteers up to 50 years in age with ""only middle-school education"" and in return the recruits have been offered ""lucrative cash bonuses"" following their deployment. According to the intelligence update, the Russian army corps typically consists of 15,000 to 20,000 troops, but British defense officials believe its newest force is ""unlikely to be decisive"" in Moscow’s war.

The announcement comes just days after the Pentagon said it believes Russia has taken heavy causalities with an estimated 70,000 to 80,000 wounded or killed in Ukraine.

""Ukrainians are unlikely to be behind these explosions in Crimea,"" Rebekah Koffler, a former intelligence officer and the author of ""Putin’s Playbook: Russia’s Secret Plan to Defeat America,"" said Wednesday. At least three explosions were reported at Saky air base in Crimea Tuesday, which a Ukrainian government official reportedly told the Washington Post were the result of an operation carried out by Ukrainian special forces. But the operation, which Fox News has not been able to verify, would represent a dramatic turn of events in the war, with Ukrainian forces demonstrating the ability to hit deep behind Russian lines in an area which Russian forces generally consider safe but also risking further escalation from Russian President Vladimir Putin. - ' A ' , Russia annexed Ukraine's Crimea peninsula in 2014, and the Kremlin claims the region as part of its territory. The government of Ukraine has never recognized Russia's claims to Crimea, a stance shared by the U.S. Vitalii, a Ukrainian Army officer, holds his weapon in a trench during tactical exercises at a military camp, amid Russia's invasion of Ukraine. ""Moscow considers it now part of Russia,"" Koffler said. ""Doctrinally, strikes on Russia would call for retaliation and further escalation."" Koffler cast doubt on the likelihood of the attack, noting that it could be part of a disinformation campaign, a tactic in which both sides are heavily engaged. She also pointed out that such a revelation by a Ukrainian official to the press on such a covert operation would be unusual and viewed as irresponsible, risking the further escalation of the conflict by Russia. ""While I don’t completely rule out the possibility of Ukrainian resistance staging detonations in Crimea… missile strikes by Kyiv on Crimea are highly unlikely,"" Koffler said. ""The Ukrainians know that it would be a red line for Putin because Russia annexed Crimea in 2014."" 53 The U.S. has supplied billions of dollars in military aide to Ukraine since the conflict began, but the assistance has come with the understanding that U.S. weapons will not be used to target the Russian mainland. A U.S. official who spoke to the Washington Post on the condition of anonymity said Tuesday that a U.S. weapon was not used in Crimea explosion. Ukraine's government has yet to confirm or deny that the explosion was a result of a Ukrainian military operation, while Russia has claimed the blast was caused by an ammunition explosion. The Ukrainian Air Force said in a statement that nine Russian military planes were destroyed in the explosion, while Russian authorities said the blast killed one person and injured 13 others. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky vowed to win back the disputed peninsula but did not mention the blast or any Ukrianian military involvement during his nightly address Tuesday. 60 ""Crimea is Ukrainian, and we will never give it up,"" he said. The explosion comes as Ukraine has intensified its offensive in areas occupied by Russian forces, using guerrilla forces loyal to Kyiv and paving the way for the military to identify targets. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy speaks from Kyiv, Ukraine. ""Our goal is to make life unbearable for the Russian occupiers and use any means to derail their plans,"" Andriy, a coordinator of the guerrilla movement in the southern Kherson region, told the Associated Press. The Kherson region, which sits just north of Crimea, has witnessed increased guerrilla activity over the summer. In June, a Russian-installed official was killed in a bomb blast in the region while on his way to work. ""Putin did underestimate the level of resistance that his invasion would cause among Ukrainians,"" Koffler said. ""It will be far from a slam dunk for Russia to truly control occupied territories given the level of resistance activities going on by pro-Ukrainian guerrilla forces.""",14,3.6690529752108842,4.47666546341802,-0.8076124882071358,22

Ukrainian officials denounced the report from the human rights group as ""unfair"" and part of a ""disinformation and propaganda campaign."" journalists observed several scenes in recent weeks that mirrored the findings of Amnesty’s researchers, including the aftermath of weapon strikes in eastern Ukraine where Ukrainian fighters, their vehicles or items such as ammunition were at attack sites. At two locations, the was told a soldier or soldiers had been killed. At a third, emergency workers blocked media from filming victims of a Russian strike on a residential building, which was unusual; locals said military personnel had been staying there. 53 In a report released Thursday, Amnesty International said its researchers between April and July ""found evidence of Ukrainian forces launching strikes from within populated residential areas, as well as basing themselves in civilian buildings in 19 towns and villages"" in three regions of the country. A view of residential buildings damaged by a military strike in Sievierodonetsk, Luhansk region, Ukraine, on April 16, 2022. Amnesty also said it found Ukrainian forces using hospitals as military bases in five places, which the human rights group called ""a clear violation of international humanitarian law."" The report noted that ""international humanitarian law requires the parties to a conflict to avoid locating, to the maximum extent feasible, military objectives within or near densely populated areas."" Combatants also must remove civilians from the ""vicinity of military objectives"" and provide warnings about possible attacks, the report said, adding that ""viable alternatives were available that would not endanger civilians such as military bases or densely wooded area nearby, or other structures further away from residential areas."" At the same time, the report's authors stressed that the ""Ukrainian military’s practice of locating military objectives within populated areas does not in any way justify indiscriminate Russian attacks."" Ukrainian authorities have repeatedly asked the remaining residents of the Donetsk region to evacuate, but starting anew elsewhere is not that easy. Tens of thousands of people who left their homes since Russia’s invasion have returned after running out of support or feeling unwelcome. The reported last week that one evacuee was killed in a missile strike two days after returning home to the city of Pokrovsk in Donetsk. Neighbors expressed anger that Ukrainian fighters had set up base in their residential area on the city’s outskirts. As journalists looked at the missile crater, a uniformed fighter walked over from the adjacent plot of land and questioned their presence.

And in Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city, the saw soldiers and military vehicles at a teaching university that was hit. Soldiers and supplies also were present at a school for the disabled where a Russian strike left two craters in the schoolyard. Aside from witness accounts, Amnesty International relied on satellite imagery and remote sensing. Its researchers heard outgoing fire from nearby Ukrainian positions while examining damaged residential areas in the regions of Kharkiv, Mykolaiv and Donbas. The Donbas region, which consists of Donetsk and Luhansk provinces, is where the war’s most intense fighting has taken place since April. 40 , ' ' The mother of a man killed in a rocket attack in a village near Mykolaiv told researchers that Ukrainian forces had stayed in a house next to theirs. The researchers found military uniforms and equipment there, according to the report. Ukraine’s Defense Ministry has not responded to the findings, the rights group said. Ukraine’s Foreign Ministry initially declined to comment to the on the Amnesty report, but Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba later Thursday released a video statement denouncing the report as ""unfair"" and expressing his outrage about it. Russia President Vladimir Putin ""Such behavior by is not about seeking the truth and bringing it to the world, it is about creating a false balance between a criminal and a victim, between a country that is annihilating civilian populations by the hundreds and the thousands, cities and entire areas, and a country that is desperately defending itself, saving its people and the continent from this invasion,"" Kuleba said. Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov also weighed in with a Facebook post. ""Any attempts to even in passing equate the unprovoked Russian aggression and Ukraine’s self-defense, like it is done in the Amnesty International report, is evidence of losing adequacy and a way to destroy one’s authority,"" Reznikov wrote. 60 Presidential advisor Mykhailo Podolyak, in turn, accused the group on Twitter of participating in a ""disinformation and propaganda campaign"" by Moscow to discredit Ukraine’s armed forces. Russian state and pro-Kremlin media have extensively quoted the report, whose findings somewhat align with Moscow’s official narrative. Russia has justified attacks on civilian areas by alleging that Ukrainian fighters are setting up firing positions there. Ukrainian servicemen stand by a destroyed house near the frontline village of Krymske, Luhansk region, in eastern Ukraine on Feb. 19, 2022.

2022-07-27,Fox,https://www.foxnews.com/world/inside-chechen-plot-circumvent-putins-war-seek-independence,Inside the Chechen plot to circumvent Putin’s war and seek independence,"Fox News correspondent Lucas Tomlinson has the latest as Russian shelling strikes cities across Eastern Ukraine on 'Special Report.' : The ghosts of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s brutal past have emerged amid his deadly war in Ukraine as a group of Chechen fighters now looks to establish their own stake in the fight. ""This is a repetition of the tragedy in Chechnya,"" Islam Belokiev, spokesman for the Sheikh Mansur Battalion, told Fox News Digital in an exclusive interview. ""In every Ukrainian today, I see that Chechen woman, Chechen man, Chechen children."" Belokiev, born in 1989, grew up amid a series of brutal civil wars in one of Russia’s most southern republics and recalled the destruction he and the children of his generation knew until he left Chechnya in 2004. Grozny, Russia, besieged by the Russian army in August 1996. ""When I was coming here from Poland, I saw a group of children from an orphanage who were crossing the Ukrainian-Polish border. This moved me very much,"" he said in an interview translated with the help of the Ukraine Frontline Media Platform. ""And then I remembered those children who also fled from Chechnya and were looking for some kind of safe haven."" Back-to-back wars broke out in Chechnya after the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, followed by a push for independence from Moscow by the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria. Chechen resistance to Russian rule dates back centuries and a deadly war raged from 1994 to 1996 before a peace treaty was signed by then-Russian President Boris Yeltsin and broad autonomy was granted. But by 1999, Putin, after taking up the post as Russian prime minster, voided the treaty and launched a decades-long military campaign in the southern republic. An estimated 160,000 civilians were killed in both campaigns, though exact figures remain unclear and Belokiev said Chechen resistance fighters believe the number of causalities from both wars to be closer to 300,000. ""We are a small [region],"" he said, noting that no one went unharmed during the decades of war with Moscow. ""We, practically, do not have a single family where there is no one who died or did not take part. ""This is a repetition of that tragedy,"" he said in reference to Putin’s ""special military operation"" in Ukraine. ""And therefore, I consider it my duty to be here."" Vitaly, 52, says he is of Russian origin and fought in the Russian army during the first Chechen war, but today fights alongside Ukrainian soldiers on Feb. 9, 2022, in Pisky, Ukraine. Originally from Donetsk, Vitaly says he saw his city invaded and people massacred. 85% : The volunteer battalion has been in Ukraine since 2014 and Belokiev joined the fight following Russia’s second invasion in February. The Chechen battalion, which allegedly has as many as 800 volunteer soldiers, has said it has a plot to use Putin’s latest war to its advantage. ""Russia is brandishing a nuclear baton and threatening the whole world with it,"" Belokiev said. ""And Chechnya, in fact, the entire North Caucasus, is the Achilles' heel of the Russian Federation."" The battalion’s spokesman argued that Chechnya is already Russia’s ""weak point"" and it behooves Ukraine and Western nations to throw their weight behind the resistance amid Putin’s war. ""If Chechnya becomes independent today and the Chechens are able to defend their freedom, this will weaken Russia,"" he claimed. ' ' 'S Ukrainian soldiers ride on an armored personnel carrier in the eastern Luhansk region on June 23, 2022. Belokiev announced a plan last week that could force Russia to divert forces from Ukraine by launching a new offensive in Chechnya – creating a second war front for Putin to grapple with. But there is a major caveat that the spokesman admitted has fallen on ""deaf"" government ears – the Chechen resistance forces want ""political, military and informational support"" from developed nations. ""We know where bases are located, how many people are there, routes and so on,"" he said, explaining they have been working with locals to identify troop movements to form their strategy. ""We need weapons with which we can fight."" The group is also calling for ""political support"" and the ""recognition of political sovereignty and the independence of the Republic of Ichkeria"" – which refers to the secessionist government in Chechnya. ""If Russia has the audacity to recognize the illegitimate Donetsk People's Republic and Luhansk People's Republic and seize the territories of other countries, then Ukraine has every right – and I consider it politically expedient – to recognize a legitimate Republic of Ichkeria,"" he added. Russian soldiers pose by a T-80 tank in a position close to the Azovstal front line in the besieged port city of Mariupol. Belokiev, whose family went into hiding following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, said the battalion is already in talks with officials from the Ukrainian government and security services, though Fox News could not independently verify this. Despite Belokiev's determination to reignite the fight for independence by relying on local populations, one expert thinks this will be easier said than done. Theodore Karasik, who reported on the Chechen wars in the '90s and serves as a fellow specializing in Russian and Middle Eastern Affairs with the Jamestown Foundation, said resistance fighters will be hard-pressed to find widespread dissent in Chechnya against the current leader, Ramzan Kadyrov. ""After Russia conquered Grozny – in the matter that it does, through meat-grinder warfare – [Moscow was] able to come to a deal with the Kadyrov clan,"" he explained. ""Kadyrov has controlled the republic for years, and any vestige of this type of thinking was long ago cast away."" Karasik explained that following the war, the Putin-backed Chechen leadership brutally cracked down on dissent in an attempt to stamp out calls for independence and told Fox News Digital, ""You still find police wrapping people up"" who oppose Moscow rule. The Chechen fighter said he and his battalion will keep defending Ukrainian sovereignty for as long as it takes, but they maintain hope that one day soon they will also be fighting for Chechen independence.",14,4.580841476281181,4.6002002924560195,-0.019358816174838367,11

Ukrainian troops are finally seeing a boost to their war effort as the impact of U.S.-supplied High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems have successfully stalled Russian forces on the front lines, Yuriy Sak advisor to Ukraine’s Defense Minister told Fox News Digital. ""They have not progressed anywhere during the last two weeks,"" Sak said in an exclusive interview. ""Their offensive is pretty much stalled at the moment. The conclusion is that they are not able to beat Ukrainian armed forces in the conventional warfare."" Russia has depended heavily on artillery strikes throughout the war, but Moscow’s stalled abilities to push forward with ground forces has prompted a greater reliance on missile strikes in civilian areas. Ukrainian soldiers are sitting at the shelling scene of a destroyed school in Kramatorsk, Donetsk, Ukraine. As Russia stepped up its ""military operation"" in Ukraine, a school in Kramatorsk was hit and destroyed by Russian rockets on July 21, 2022. , ""We've managed to slow them down on the front line, we have managed to stabilize the front line. But at the same time, they are still shooting missiles at cities across Ukraine,"" the defense official explained. ""This is why they resort to the tactics of terror."" However, Sak said Moscow’s heavy reliance on artillery, and its inability to effectively advance ground forces has given Kyiv an effective operational strategy to repel Russian troops. The has become top dog in Ukraine’s defensive posture because it has enabled Ukrainian forces to hit Russia where it hurts the most – its eastern and southern ammunitions depots. The M142 has proven particularly effective given its range of roughly 50 miles. The missile system is reportedly more effective than previous artillery deployed to Ukraine, and as it is essentially a rocket system mounted to the back of a truck, its high mobility makes it more difficult for opposing forces to target. The U.S. has so far pledged to send at least 20 to Kyiv. ""We are very thankful to the U.S. government to the U.S. people for their unprecedented support. I'm telling you this sincerely from the bottom of my heart,"" Sak said. ""Small children in Ukraine, without exception, know the word now. ""They will start calling their kittens and puppies ,"" he added in a stark reminder of how deeply every Ukrainian has been affected by the war.

U.S. defense officials estimated that Russia has deployed 85 percent of its fighting force, but even with military aid provided by the U.S. and other Western nations, Sak warned that Ukraine is still short of what it needs to fight effectively. 5 : ' ' ""The Ukrainian armed forces have been outnumbered and outgunned,"" he said. ""We still need more because the front line extends to over 2,500 km . It’s huge. ""It's a distance between Warsaw in Poland and Barcelona in Spain. It's a distance which is almost the length of the U.S.-Mexico border,"" he explained for context. Sak argued that Ukraine needs longer range missile capabilities, like the Army Tactical Missile System which has a range of roughly 185 miles. The longer range of fire would allow Ukrainian forces to more effectively launch counter-offensives against Russia. However, White House National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said speaking from the Aspen Security Forum Friday that President Biden is not yet prepared to supply Ukraine with certain missile systems. ""One of them are long-range missiles, , which have a range of 300 km,"" explained Sullivan. ""He does believe that while the key goal of the United States is to do the needful to support and defend Ukraine, another key goal is to ensure that we do not end up in a circumstance where we are heading down the road towards a third World War,"" he added. Ukrainian servicemen fire a towed howitzer in eastern Ukraine July 18, 2022. ) However, Sak pushed back on this line of reasoning and argued Kyiv has made it clear that it has no intention to strike targets within Russia’s internationally recognized borders. ""We just want to de-occupy our land, and we want to be able to defend our people,"" he told Fox News Digital with the aid of the Ukraine Frontline Media Platform, who helped facilitate the interview with the official. The defense official said Ukraine needs more than just advanced missile systems to counter Russian forces. Defense systems, armored vehicles, tanks and modern combat aircraft are essential if Kyiv wants to liberate its occupied territories. The defense ministry has broken down its strategy across Ukraine into three different operational objectives, including stabilizing the eastern front with the goal of liberating the temporarily occupied territories. The second component is the ""gradual liberation"" of the occupied areas in southern Ukraine and finally, preserving the security of the northern border. ""We understand that we cannot sacrifice one of these components and gamble and hope that nothing will happen. We have always been prepared for any turn of events because we know that we are facing a very unpredictable and deranged enemy,"" Sak said.

Since invading Ukraine, Russia has upped their cyberattacks on the United States and its allies, according to a report from Microsoft, and there are several lessons to help protect against these attacks in the future, Microsoft President and vice-Chair Brad Smith told Fox News Digital. A drastic cyberattack against the United States is not a far-reaching idea. In fact, according to the report ""Defending Ukraine: Early Lessons from the Cyber War,"" Microsoft has tracked Russian cyber hacking in 42 countries, with the United States being the top target, followed by Poland. ""I would say the number one goal of the Russians appears to be to get access to information so they know what governments are planning to do, it’s sort of classic espionage,"" Smith told Fox News Digital at the Aspen Security Forum. The war in Ukraine, while brutal on the ground, shows that Russia is a major cyber threat as well, Smith said, noting that the country has used their cyber capabilities in three ways. 5 ' Microsoft Corp. logo outside the Microsoft Visitor Center in Redmond, Wash. ""First, with destructive cyberattacks,"" he said. ""If they are trying to take over a nuclear power plant, they also try to take over the network, say the day before they have the troops outside. The second prominent way Russia has been using its cyber capabilities is ""espionage outside of Ukraine,"" Smith said, referencing more than 120 efforts in just the first few months of the war to infiltrate Microsoft customers, primarily governments. ""The third thing is what we call cyber influence operations,"" he added. ""This is really an effort to put out propaganda to support the Russian war aims."" , : Smith said Microsoft has tracked an 82% increase of Russian propaganda in the United States, and a 216% increase in Ukraine. Russia President Vladimir Putin. One lesson, according to the report, is that countries should distribute digital operations and data sets across geographies. ""It’s sort of a classic lesson from military history,"" Smith said. ""When German bombers were dropping bombs on London, the British moved their communications infrastructure underground. Today, a data center can be taken out by a cruise missile, and that, in fact, is part of what the Ukrainians experienced."" Smith also highlighted the importance of public-private partnerships when dealing with cyberspace, in contrast to traditional warfare which took place on land, sea and air. 85% : A pallet of fuses for 155 mm shells, ultimately bound for Ukraine, is spun as it's loaded on to a C-17 cargo aircraft, April 29, 2022, at Dover Air Force Base, Del.

Russian defense officials insisted Sunday that an airstrike on the Ukrainian port of Odesa hit only military targets, but the attack tested an agreement on resuming grain shipments that the two countries signed less than a day before the assault. Long-range missiles destroyed a docked Ukrainian warship and a warehouse holding Harpoon anti-ship missiles supplied by the U.S., Defense Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov said at a daily briefing. Speaking late Saturday in his nightly televised address, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the attack on Odesa ""destroyed the very possibility"" of dialogue with Russia.

Turkey’s defense minister, however, said he had reports from Ukrainian authorities that one missile struck a grain silo while another landed nearby, although neither affected loading at Odesa’s docks. It was not immediately clear how the airstrike would affect plans to resume shipping Ukrainian grain by sea in safe corridors out of the ports. Russia and Ukraine on Friday signed identical agreements with the United Nations and Turkey in Istanbul aimed at clearing the way for the shipment of millions of tons of desperately needed Ukrainian grain, as well as the export of Russian grain and fertilizer.

It is unclear if the Chechen volunteer forces are strategizing with Kyiv by creating a second front, but Koffler noted that even if a second front is not fully launched in Chechnya, it could still strain Putin’s forces.

The First Lady of Ukraine Olena Zelenska on Wednesday addressed Congress in an emotional appeal as Russia continues its deadly war in Ukraine. Zelenska highlighted the atrocities that Russian forces have committed on civilians, particularly on the children of Ukraine. In an unusual turn of events, the Ukrainian first lady made a plea for arms and defensive weaponry to better fend off Russia’s continued assault. Olena Zelenska, the first lady of Ukraine, arrives to address members of Congress on Capitol Hill in Washington, Wednesday, July 20, 2022. , 'S ""I’m asking for weapons,"" she said. ""I’m asking for air defense systems in order for rockets not to kill children in their strollers ""Help us stop this terror,"" she continued.

""We want every mother and every father to be able to tell their child ‘go to sleep peacefully, there will be no more air strikes’. Is this too much to wish for?"" she questioned. The Ukrainian first lady’s plea comes as Russia has increased its missile strikes across the country and is once again honing in on areas around the capital city of Kyiv. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov on Wednesday announced that Moscow’s war ambition was no longer just ""full control"" over the Donbas regions, but said Russia has expanded the geographical objectives of its ""special military operation.""

Though the foreign minister’s comments suggest this is a new strategy Moscow will pursue, Russian forces have occupied these areas and engaged in a brutal campaign there for months. Lavrov suggested Russia’s objectives in Ukraine had changed as Western allies continue to send defensive aid to Kyiv.

A Belarusian commander in the Kastus Kalinouski Regiment told Fox News Digital in an exclusive interview Friday that he believes it is just a ""matter of time"" before he is forced to fight against his own nation in Russia’s deadly war in Ukraine. Ukrainian leaders have warned Belarus against entering the war in support of Russia, but comments made by Belarusian President Aleksandr Lukashenko suggest Minsk may be preparing to create another battlefront Kyiv will have to grapple with. ""Aggression against Ukraine is now being carried out from the territory of Belarus,"" the commander detailed to Fox News Digital in an interview translated with the help from the Ukraine Frontline Media Platform. ""It’s a big regional threat right now, because Lukashenko remains quasi-independent – primarily tactically advantageous for Russia. They want to use him for further escalation in the region. ""The issue of Belarus entering the war by ground troops is only a matter of time, and it could happen soon,"" he warned. Belarusian solider of Kastus Kalinouski Regiment in Ukraine - , 'S The threat of the unknown is nothing new for this Belarusian commander who has risked his life in Ukraine for nearly a decade to repel aggression from Russian President Vladimir Putin. Now serving as a brigade commander training troops outside of Kyiv, he goes by the pseudonym-turned-call sign ""Igor,"" which was given to him after he first volunteered to fight in Ukraine over eight years ago. ""In 2014 I had a meeting with a political-military representative in Ukraine, and we didn’t want to let everyone know who we were,"" he said in reference to a fellow soldier of his who took the meeting with him. ""I discussed this with my friend and made a decision that he would call me ‘Igor’ and I’d also use another name for him."" The pseudonym stuck, he explained with a chuckle. In 2014, Igor voluntarily crossed into Ukraine to join up with its armed forces after Putin invaded under the guise of supporting then-President Viktor Yanukovych, who in November 2013 sparked mass protests after he rejected a plan that would further integrate Ukraine with the European Union. Yanukovych attempted to violently suppress the public outcry before he was ousted. In a move that echoed steps Putin would take in Belarus just seven years later following what Western officials have decried as a botched election when Lukashenko again assumed the presidency, Russia entered Ukraine in February 2014 in an attempt to secure its regional influence. By March of that year, Putin had annexed Crimea and fighting in the Donbas has since continued. But Igor said he saw the writing on the wall and knew this would become a bigger problem if Ukraine’s sovereignty wasn’t respected. ""I realized that global changes in our region were beginning, and I realized that the question of freedom for Ukraine and Belarus is the question of fighting against the Putin and Lukashenko regimes,"" he said, adding he had assumed the all-out war the world is now watching would have begun in 2014 but said Moscow’s waiting game gave them ""an opportunity to prepare."" Igor said he believes that just 20 percent of Belarusians support Lukashenko and his allegiance to Putin and that only three percent support the ""special military operation"" in Ukraine. Belarusian soldiers train in Ukraine with Kastus Kalinouski Regiment , But Lukashenko's apparent increasing willingness to enter the war means Igor, and the hundreds of other Belarusian fighters who have volunteered on the front lines, could be squaring off with their own countrymen. Late last month, Belarus reportedly made moves to expand its military conscription and began distributing summons to men and women for ""mobilization exercises"" in the Gomel region which shares a border with Ukraine – where a series of trainings began earlier this week. Igor has taken a hard line when it comes to facing his countrymen on the battlefield and said, ""Maybe on the passport they are Belarusians but in fact they are full of pro-Russian and pro-imperial mentality."" ""Any soldier can refuse to enter Ukraine under various causes, but those who will obey orders of Putin and Lukashenko - we will consider as enemies, and we will not have any sentiments in their direction,"" he added. Concerns have mounted over how Ukraine will be able to grapple with not only the addition of a northern front but with the possibility that Russia could gain an edge as more boots on the ground enter the fray. ""Surely for Ukraine, it will be more difficult and this will divert some of the forces from the frontline in the east and south,"" Igor said. ""But I’m sure that victory will be ours and we’ll deal with it."" Soldiers of the Belarusian Kastus Kalinouski Regiment train in Ukraine. The brigade commander said the decision to enter the war would be a colossal mistake for the controversial Belarusian president. ""Order on the ground operation in Ukraine,"" he warned ""and it’ll be one of the last Lukashenko orders.""",14,2.3826850502541674,3.7224658850682193,-1.3397808348140519,21

In this frame grab provided by Russian Defense Ministry press service, a long-range Kalibr cruise missile is launched by a Russian Navy ship in the eastern Mediterranean, Friday, Aug. 19, 2016. It is unclear where in the Black Sea the missile was fired from, but given its ability to hit a target up to 1,500 miles away, the missile is more than capable of reaching Kyiv.

Now, some of those caught up in this war are speaking out for themselves. One hundred fifty Buryat soldiers terminated their military contracts earlier this month, according to members of the Free Buryatia Foundation, a pro-democracy group based in the United States and representing its constituency from abroad. A group of wives and mothers of the soldiers recorded a video appeal to the governor of Buryatia to let the servicemen return home. The video caused a stir and was quickly taken down by its intimidated producers. But the men reportedly made it home after a detour to a closed military facility in Luhansk for some days. Still, the fact that the soldiers are back may be giving other groups hope that they too can recall their families. In this photo provided by the Ukrainian Defence Ministry Press Office July 7, 2022, Ukrainian soldiers install the state flag on Snake Island in the Black Sea. Buryatia, according to Vladimir Budaev of the Free Buryatia Foundation, ranks 81st among 85 regions in wealth in the Russian Federation. Put another way, it is close to being the poorest part of the country. Buryats are closely related to the people of Mongolia. Budaev claims the region in east Siberia is kept artificially poor by the center, by the Kremlin, in order to keep it dependent on the largesse of Moscow. Buryatia has one of the highest war casualty rates in Russia. ""This is the colonial policy of Russia,"" Budaev told Fox News. ""It’s about xenophobia and chauvinism because we are Buryats. We are not the core population of Russia. So, basically, they treat us as expendables."" For many, before the war, the military was the only real social lift. In peacetime, army jobs turned out to be more like civil service gigs. In a region where average monthly salaries are below $400 a month, pay that can now be close to eight times that is attractive. Paying and aggressive recruitment is all Russian President Putin has at this point to keep his war machine moving. He has not called for a general mobilization, presumably for political reasons. And for that reason, human-rights lawyers say soldiers can even refuse to go to war if they want. But it won’t be that easy. Nor straightforward. But apparently hundreds, if not thousands, of Russians and non-ethnic Russians alike are seeking help to get out of contracts or be spared from going to Ukraine. Soldiers hold flares as they attend the funeral for activist and soldier Roman Ratushnyi in Kyiv, Ukraine June 18, 2022. Budaev believes a few thousand soldiers from Buryatia have deployed and that around 200 have been killed. But it is impossible to know true numbers of casualties. An independent media outlet in the regional capital of Ulan-Ude claims there is a funeral or two each day. - ? The families say their soldiers were deceived about their deployment, and another member of the Free Buryatia Foundation has said their people have been used as ""cannon fodder."" The independent outlet MediaZona believes Daghestanis have died in similar numbers to Buryats compared to nine in Moscow and thirty in St. Petersburg. According to many Russia followers, the Kremlin is particularly sensitive about casualties from the capital — if those numbers become significant it could lead to civil unrest. But clearly Moscow is nervous about the mood in Buryatia too now. The government has just blocked Free Buryatia's website. A woman wrapped in a Ukrainian flag attends the funeral of activist and soldier Roman Ratushnyi in Kyiv, Ukraine, June 18, 2022. Budaev says Buryat soldiers, perhaps not unlike their Russian comrades, don’t know what they are doing in Ukraine. ""There are no Nazis in Ukraine,"" Budaev said. ""They face Nazism in Russia. If Asian Russians go to Moscow, they hear insults. It’s not our war. Not all Russians support this war.

Nearly five months into Putin's invasion of Ukraine, a lack of rest among strained Russian forces is likely contributing to their morale issues and stalled advances in some parts of the country, the U.K. Defense Ministry said Monday. ""The lack of scheduled breaks from intense combat conditions is highly likely one of the most damaging of the many personnel issues the Russian [Ministry of Defense] is struggling to rectify amongst the deployed force,"" the defense officials said in an intelligence update.

""Despite growing calls for increased recruitment from nationalist figures, Russian leadership continues to carry out coercive partial mobilization efforts that are only producing limited numbers of replacements while negatively impacting the morale and discipline of forcibly mobilized personnel,"" the Institute for War Studies wrote in a recent assessment.

Conscription for women in the ranks was expanded to include a vast number of qualifying professions for mandatory registration, including librarians, journalists, musicians and psychologists, among others. Female conscription in Ukraine is nothing new and women have been serving in Ukraine’s military since 1993 following Kyiv’s independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. Not all female conscripts will see the front lines as many have traditionally helped with logistical support. Though in 2014 when Russia first invaded the Donbas region, 257 women were granted awards for their combat service – nine of which were awarded posthumously, according to the advocacy organization Security Women.

Gen. Keith Kellogg weighs in on Putin’s threats following Finland and Sweden joining . Recent comments from Russian President Vladimir Putin amount to little more than posturing after a disastrous campaign in Ukraine, but any comment from a world leader with a nuclear arsenal should be taken seriously, military experts told Fox News Digital. ""I think when Putin says stuff like this, all he does is really kind of reinforce the point that [Russia’s] not really responding to a legitimate external threat,"" James Carafano, Vice President of The Institute for National Security and Foreign Policy at the Heritage Foundation, said. Finland and Sweden reversed historically neutral positions following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, explaining that the ""security landscape"" in Europe had changed. Turkey said it would not support either country’s bid to join the alliance, which would effectively block their entry since any applicant requires full support from native members.

Putin on Wednesday said that Sweden and Finland could ""go ahead"" and join , but warned that Russia would ""respond in kind"" if either country hosted the alliance’s military forces or infrastructure. , ""I'm not sure I would read anything strategic into it because on its face: It's a completely ridiculous statement,"" Carafano said. ""I don't think you can really read anything strategic into it."" Carafano explained that establishing any such infrastructure would take ""months or even years"" to complete, and the two countries already cooperate with allies even if they aren’t currently members. ""Finland and Sweden already cooperate and integrate its stuff with the U.S. military, so the notion that any member would allow an outsider like Russia to dictate what kind of deployment infrastructure could be in a territory is just laughable on its face,"" Carafano said. , - Carafano suggested that Putin could have intended the comments sarcastically, but that ""only Putin knows what Putin is going to do."" ""The guy’s pretty much a dictator, and he has an arsenal of nuclear weapons and a military, so I would never say, ‘Oh, geez, he’ll never do that,’"" Carafano added. ""But if you look at this consistent pattern of Russian behavior, where they have been threatening all kinds of things – everything from implying nuclear exchanges to military activity – in the end, all the Russians have done is annoy."" James Anderson, acting Under Secretary of Defense for Policy under President Trump, argued that Putin needs to save face after causing two neutral countries to join the alliance thanks to his invasion of Ukraine. 18 , 2 , ""[The Russian people] see – and he no doubt fears they see – his aggressive actions in Ukraine have driven historically neutral countries to seek membership [in ],"" Anderson said. ""In a strategic sense, Putin’s invasion has made Russia as a whole less secure – not only because of the fact that the invasion did not go well, but now is poised to grow."" Anderson called Putin’s recent comments efforts to ""reframe"" the course of the war and its outcomes, calling Sweden and Finland’s efforts to join ""strategically significant."" ""All one has to do is look at the map to see that [Sweden and Finland] are in a geographically important position on the northern flank: It will become easier for to operate in the Baltic Sea,"" Anderson explained. ""It will also complicate to an extent Moscow's Arctic strategy."" ""Within , there’s an East-West divide: You have countries that are closer to the border, including Poland, the Baltics … who more directly feel the threat of the Russian bear,"" he added.

Russia’s deadly war continues to rage in eastern and southern Ukraine, but Ukrainians in the north and west are now bracing for a new fight as concerns mount that Belarus could launch a land invasion by mid-July. Following Russia’s first attempts to take the capital city of Kyiv and its subsequent withdrawal from the north, Ukrainians have done their best to return to normal life. Anastasiya Koval, a Ukrainian American who just returned from Lviv, said bars, restaurants and shops reopened roughly a month after Moscow invaded in what Russian President Vladimir Putin has dubbed a ""special military operation.""

The threat that the war in Ukraine poses has not escaped Ukrainians living through the largest European conflict since World War , and there is growing chatter that Belarus will officially join the war and launch a ground invasion by mid-July. Last week Russian missiles were fired at Ukrainian targets from within Belarusian territory for the first time since the war began in February. It remains unclear if Minsk will officially enter the war, but Belarusian President Aleksandr Lukashenko has repeatedly backed Putin and on Sunday told local media he has supported Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine ""from the very first day."" Russia’s renewed bombardment in northern and western Ukraine has increased in recent weeks despite repeated Russian claims that the military operation is aimed at taking ""full control"" over eastern and southern Ukraine. ""I don't know if Belarus is going to actually invade [or] if it's a scare tactic,"" Koval said, arguing it could also be a ploy to encourage Kyiv to move soldiers off its front lines, which would enable Russia to gain ground.

Koval’s father was born in Ukraine and served in the Soviet Army prior to its dissolution in 1992. He later moved to the U.S. to raise his family. He has aided the Ukrainian armed services since Russia’s 2014 invasion and uses his contacts on the ground to get frontline fighters equipment like helmets, bulletproof vests, water filters, boots, tourniquet kits and other medical supplies. Koval explained that because of the scale of the war, the Ukrainian government is only able to provide roughly 65% of basic on the ground needs. The other 35% have to be sourced through personal means or by organizational help. ""He feels it's his obligation, his duty to help defend his land. He's far more valuable not behind a gun but behind a desk because he speaks four languages fluently – Polish, Ukrainian, Russian and English. Which is such a valuable asset right now,"" Koval said. ""He's coordinating so much logistic[ally] and he is literally suiting boys up who would otherwise be dead,"" she added. Western officials have championed Ukraine’s ability to hold off Russian forces and stop what many believe Putin thought would be a swift operation. Despite the incremental gains Russia has made in the east and south, Koval said Ukrainians remain convinced they will win in the end.

The human rights group interviewed dozens of survivors of the attack and analyzed satellite imagery, radar data, architectural blueprints of the structure, and video evidence in coming to its conclusion. ""Many people were injured and killed in this merciless attack. Their deaths were likely caused by Russian forces deliberately targeting Ukrainian civilians,"" Amnesty International Secretary General Agnès Callamard said in a statement on Thursday.

What a loss for Russian President Vladimir Putin. Finland and Sweden just shed decades of cherished neutrality to join , and the allies — including Turkey — said yes. Pause with me for a moment and grasp what an astonishing change this is for Finland and Sweden. While both have been close partners for years, training and even deploying forces alongside missions, both nations made U-turns in their foreign policy. Sweden has not joined an alliance or fought in a war since 1814. You read that right. Citizens of Finland and Sweden did not want to join six months ago, but now they do. Putin’s aggression and the reality of modern war made it urgent for Finland and Sweden to become full members of . In this era of cyber attacks and Russian air and missile strikes, deterrence has to be in place from the start. Tough talk, intelligence leaks, and sanctions threats did not stop Putin from invading Ukraine. Only a true alliance can guarantee safety. , Joining brings Finland and Sweden into a common air defense picture, extends ’s cyber resilience capabilities, and the nuclear deterrence guarantee is included, too. A Ukrainian multiple rocket launcher -21 ""Grad"" shells a Russian troop position near Luhansk in the Donbas region on Sunday. It’s a good step for . Finland adds 830 more miles of border, sewing up a barrier against Russia from Istanbul to the Arctic Circle and beyond. Finland, pop. 5.5 million, brings a top-notch Air Force, an army that expands up to 900,000, and the largest reserve of artillery in Europe. Word is they have more ammo than pine trees up there. Don’t forget they are world leaders in communications technology. Sweden was officially neutral in World War I, World War and kept up its defenses and stayed non-aligned through the Cold War. But they have long been a defense industry powerhouse, and Sweden’s military has specialized experience with the Arctic and undersea domains. They are building new combat aircraft from their successful Gripen series and deploying more submarines. Sweden reinforced the strategic island of Gotland earlier this year and allocated more funds for military infrastructure and naval operations. Don’t think for one moment that Finland and Sweden sought membership because they are scared of Russia. Nope, they’ve lived in that neighborhood a long time. And of course, Finland won a moral victory against the Russians of the Soviet Union in the Winter War of 1939. In fact, they invented Molotov cocktails — makeshift gasoline bottle bombs thrown at tanks — during that war. I think it’s more accurate to say they are disgusted with Putin, his illegal invasion, and his brutality, like the air and missile strikes launched against 40 targets in Ukraine on June 26. Harassing Russian military flights in Sweden’s airspace didn’t help. What’s the point of non-alignment when the other camp contains a thug like Putin? Finland, Sweden and have sent a message to Putin: the good guys are adding teammates. The same message goes to China, still backing Russia. As for Turkey , this is a good time to get military cooperation back on track. Credit goes to Finland and Sweden for working out a trilateral arrangement with Turkey to enable unanimous approval. As a result, I’d like to see Turkey back in line to buy F-35 fighter jets and return their pilots to the joint F-35 training. As Gen. Dwight Eisenhower knew when was formed, Turkey is the bulwark of ’s southern flank, misbehaving or not. Why? Two words: Bosporus Straits. Turkey controls all access from the Mediterranean to the Black Sea through this critical waterway, which is narrower than the Hudson River around Manhattan at key points. For example, if ever wants to bust that Black Sea blockade of Ukraine’s grain ports by Russia, warships must transit the Bosporus. Russian President Vladimir Putin chairs a meeting on the country's transport industry via a video link in Sochi, Russia May 24, 2022. Finally, Finland and Sweden’s choice should put to rest the myth that a thriving in any way justifies Putin’s callous actions. It’s bonkers to blame ’s acceptance of new members for Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. Most new member states joined when Russia was actually part of the Group of Seven, briefly renamed the G8, from 1997 to 2014. It was a period when leaders tried their best to treat Russia as a normal, European power and help Putin choose prosperity instead of plunder. I’m tired of Washington analysts talking about how Putin ""felt"" when got bigger. The atrocities committed by Russian forces at Bucha and elsewhere should have vaporized that sentiment. The next step is for ’s parliaments to ratify the treaty update. will then have 32 members, making this North Atlantic Treaty Organization founded in 1949 the most successful alliance in world history. and its friends are the best hope of the world.

A Russian lawmaker on Wednesday said Moscow will look to repeal its recognition of the independence of former Soviet nations like Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia in an attempt to revoke their protections. State Duma deputy Yevgeny Fedorov told a Latvian news outlet that reversing Russia’s decision to recognize the Baltic States as sovereign would allegedly create legal grounds to force the alliance to divert to 1997 borders. ""The Charter contains clause six, according to which the disputed territories cannot be included in the alliance. As soon as the territories of the Baltic countries are recognized as disputed, this will become the basis for the exclusion of the Baltic countries from ,"" Fedorov said. Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, center, participates in a media conference with Finland's Foreign Minister Pekka Haavisto, left, and Sweden's Foreign Minister Ann Linde, right, at headquarters in Brussels on Jan. 24. 'S , Last week Fedorov introduced legislation targeting Lithuanian sovereignty and claimed it illegally left the Soviet Union more than three decades ago. Lithuania became the first republic to announce it would restore its independence from the collapsing in March 1990 after being under Soviet control since 1940. Moscow, under President Mikhail Gorbachev, acknowledged Lithuania's sovereignty by September 1991. Fedorov claimed that Lithuania was Russia’s first target as it posed the greatest threat to Moscow and claimed it was ""'s gateway to the Baltics."" But the Russian lawmaker also said that other former Soviet states could be next. ""The Commander-in-Chief determined that our ‘red lines’ run along the borders of in 1997. This means that we need, at a minimum, to push beyond the borders of the former Soviet Union,"" he said in reference to an era before eastern European nations were invited to join the alliance.

The only nations to join between 1997 and 2004 were Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic, and Russia has repeatedly called for the disarmament of these nations – a move has flatly rejected. ""If countries do not pose a threat, then we will not change anything with them - there will still be peace and friendship,"" the state deputy claimed. Fedorov threatened that should Russia decide to reverse its recognition of independent Baltic States then should boot them from the alliance or accept that a ""Third World War will begin."" has not publicly commented on Russia’s potential move to repeal its recognition of Baltic States’ sovereignty. But in an address Wednesday, Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg pledged to bolster security efforts within alliance and beyond. ""President Putin's goals goes beyond Ukraine, and that's the reason why we need to both provide support to Ukraine as we do, but also strengthen our deterrence and defense not least in the eastern part of the Alliance,"" he told reporters. Despite Russia’s unveiled threats to allies, experts told Fox News there was no chance Moscow would be able to dictate membership. ""First, would not ‘boot’ any nation out of the Alliance. is the result of a treaty, the Washington Treaty, so the only way for a member to leave the Alliance is by their own choice,"" Former Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Europe and , Michael Ryan, said. ""Second, the United States never recognized the incorporation of the Baltic States into the Soviet Union.

2022-06-13,Fox,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/finland-sweden-joining-nato-us-safer,Finland and Sweden joining NATO won't make U.S. safer,"U.S. Ambassador to Finland Douglas Hickey discusses Finland and Sweden applying for membership. In the aftermath of Russia’s immoral invasion of Ukraine, the news that Sweden and Finland are abandoning their long-held neutrality in favor of joining the North Atlantic Treaty Organization is being met with much exuberance by the American political elite. President Joe Biden celebrated the move with a joint press conference at the White House featuring the leaders of both countries. On the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue, Senators Chuck Schumer and Mitch McConnell — leaders in two parties that seemingly agree on almost nothing these days — jointly sponsored a resolution calling for expedited accession. Much of the Beltway media predictably joined the chorus, with editorials from newspapers such as the Washington Post heralding the move. For America’s political establishment, expansion has been one of the closest things to a foreign policy holy sacrament in the post-Cold War era. But our policy-making elite are doing the American people a disservice by rubber-stamping an expansion of America’s security commitments through during a period of economic turmoil at home and emerging security challenges in other parts of the world. ’S It is not in the national interest of the United States, through , to commit to defend two wealthy European welfare states whose neutrality has kept them safe and prosperous for more than 70 years. While some insist Russia’s invasion of Ukraine changes everything, the fact remains that new security guarantees will force trade-offs, consume more resources, and increase the likelihood of a confrontation with a nuclear-armed adversary. Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, center, participates in a media conference with Finland's Foreign Minister Pekka Haavisto, left, and Sweden's Foreign Minister Ann Linde, right, at headquarters in Brussels on Jan. 24. Despite rhetoric from evangelists that can often give the contrary impression, adding Finland and Sweden to will lead to increased costs for the U.S. Admitting both nations to could generate up-front expenses of over $8 billion along with $1.5 billion in additional annual costs. And while U.S. military leaders are currently claiming that their membership in won’t lead to a permanent stationing of troops in either nation, they do admit that more U.S. troops will likely rotate to both Finland and Sweden on a more frequent basis. This will place further strain on a U.S. military that is already struggling to sustain deployments in support of dozens of ongoing operations including active combat missions in Iraq, Syria, and Somalia. One frequently cited justification for admitting Finland and Sweden to is that they have capable militaries that would enhance . However, the reality is that both countries have relatively small professional militaries of around 20,000 troops each that rely on large reserve forces in a time of war and which lack long-range force projection capabilities. Sweden is already requesting a larger U.S. naval presence in the Baltic Sea, calling into question the ability of their military to secure their own backyard. Additionally, neither country currently meets the 2 percent of defense spending goal that was agreed to by members. Just as in other parts of Europe, a security guarantee provided by the United States could encourage free-riding and disincentivize increased investment in defense capabilities in favor of more spending on politically popular social programs. But most dangerously, adding Finland and Sweden to will increase the risk of a nuclear confrontation with Russia. As a result of its failures in Ukraine, the threat posed by Russia’s conventional forces has been reduced. But Russia still possesses a large nuclear arsenal that, according to the head of the Defense Intelligence Agency, they will likely rely on more to secure their borders — including the nearly 850-mile one they share with Finland. membership for Finland and Sweden includes extending the umbrella of America’s nuclear deterrent to both nations, thus elevating the risk that any border dispute could escalate into a nuclear exchange. Instead of enabling accession for Finland and Sweden, the United States should take actions to encourage the strengthening and development of non- security architectures in Europe like the Nordic Defence Cooperation, which Finland and Sweden are already a part of. The failures of Russia’s military in Ukraine have demonstrated that collectively Europe is more than capable of securing itself without significant U.S. support, as long they properly prioritize defense investments. At a time of record inflation and a $30.5 trillion national debt, it is hard to justify spending more American tax dollars and committing more American troops to defend two wealthy European social democracies. This is particularly true when neither state enhances U.S. security and both have benefited from neutrality for decades. The lack of robust debate around this important topic and the smearing of those who dare to question the benefits of expansion only raises the risk that the United States will become overextended, or worse, potentially sleep-walk into a war with a nuclear-armed Russia. After decades of foreign policy failures that have cost the United States dearly, America’s elected officials owe the American people better than more costly security commitments disconnected from our safety and economic prosperity.

As soon as they had finished burying a veteran colonel killed by Russian shelling, the cemetery workers readied the next hole. Inevitably, given how quickly death is felling Ukrainian troops on the front lines, the grave won’t stay empty for long. Col. Oleksandr Makhachek left behind a widow, Elena, and their daughters Olena and Myroslava-Oleksandra. In the first 100 days of war, his grave was the 40th dug in the military cemetery in Zhytomyr, 90 miles west of the capital, Kyiv. He was killed May 30 in the Luhansk region of eastern Ukraine, where the fighting is raging. Nearby, the burial notice on the also freshly dug grave of Viacheslav Dvornitskyi says he died May 27. Other graves also showed soldiers killed within days of each other — on May 10, 9, 7 and 5. And this is just one cemetery, in just one of Ukraine’s cities, towns and villages laying soldiers to rest. Ukrainian servicemen carry the coffin with the remains of Army Col. Oleksander Makhachek during his funeral in Zhytomyr, Ukraine, on Friday, June 3. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said this week that Ukraine is now losing 60 to 100 soldiers each day in combat. By way of comparison, just short of 50 American soldiers died per day on average in 1968 during the Vietnam War’s deadliest year for U.S. forces. : ‘ ’ Among the comrades-in-arms who paid respects to the 49-year-old Makhachek at his funeral on Friday was Gen. Viktor Muzhenko, the Ukrainian Armed Forces’ chief of general staff until 2019. He warned that losses could worsen. ""This is one of the critical moments in the war, but it is not the peak,"" Muzhenko told The Associated Press. ""This is the most significant conflict in Europe since World War . That explains why the losses are so great. In order to reduce losses, Ukraine now needs powerful weapons that match or even surpass Russian weaponry. This would enable Ukraine to respond in kind."" Concentrations of Russian artillery are causing many of the casualties in the eastern regions that Moscow has focused on since its initial invasion launched Feb. 24 failed to take Kyiv. Tombs of people who died after Russia invasion are seen in Bucha cemetery, outskirts of Kyiv, Ukraine, Tuesday, May 24. Retired Lt. Gen. Ben Hodges, the former commanding general of U.S. Army forces in Europe, described the Russian strategy as a ""medieval attrition approach"" and said that until Ukraine gets promised deliveries of U.S., British and other weapons to destroy and disrupt Russian batteries, ""these kinds of casualties are going to continue."" ""This battlefield is so much more lethal than what we all became accustomed to over the 20 years of Iraq and Afghanistan, where we didn’t have numbers like this,"" he said in an phone interview. ""That level of attrition would include leaders, sergeants,"" he added. ""They are a lot of the brunt of casualties because they are the more exposed, constantly moving around trying to do things."" - Makhachek, a military engineer, led a detachment that laid minefields and other defenses, said Col. Ruslan Shutov, who attended the funeral of his friend of more than 30 years. ""Once the shelling began, he and a group hid in a shelter.

Claims of casualties by government officials – who may sometimes exaggerate or lowball their figures for public relations reasons – are all but impossible to verify. Western analysts estimate far higher Russian military casualties, in the many thousands. Still, as Ukraine’s losses mount, the grim mathematics of war require that it find replacements. With a population of 43 million, it has manpower. ""The problem is recruiting, training and getting them on the front line,"" said retired U.S. Marine Col. Mark Cancian, a senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. ""If the war is now moving into a long-term attrition struggle, then you have to build systems to get replacements,"" he said. ""This has been a difficult moment for every army in combat.""

Danny Davis weighs in as Russian forces ramp up their assault against the Ukrainian resistance. A U.S. Army veteran who served in Iraq is now volunteering in Ukraine’s fight against Russia, training troops before they head to the front lines in defense of their country. ""These are ordinary civilians who, 1776 style, have decided to answer their nation’s call to duty,"" the Army veteran, who talked to Fox News on condition of anonymity due to concerns for his safety, said. ""They’re willing to die for the land that they inhabit. They truly believe that the direction is towards a classically liberal, democratic society integrated with western values. A U.S. Army veteran poses for a group photo with members of the Ukrainian Territorial Defense force. The Army veteran was a member of the Army’s Military Police Corps between 2006-2011 and was deployed to Iraq in 2009-2010. He also worked as a security contractor in Afghanistan after his time in the Army. But now the American finds himself close to the front lines of a different war, choosing to voluntarily travel to Ukraine to train their forces before potentially joining them on the front lines of the war against Russia. 60-100 ""I am a fan of the culture and people of Ukraine,"" the American said of his motivation for wanting to help the Ukrainian war effort. ""They have rejected their communist past and they love our country more than some of our own people."" He also noted that the war’s outcome will have a dramatic effect on the U.S. and its allies, arguing he ""stands at the last outpost of western society."" ""If Russia is able to control major port cities and swaths of agricultural land, along with maintaining influence on American allies through pretropolitics, our transatlantic alliances and businesses will collapse,"" he argued. ""The resulting food crisis will affect the developing world and cause more migrants to flood into Europe and disrupt the political systems."" The Army veteran, who has paid for his own travel, clothing, and gear in order to volunteer, has spent most of his time getting Ukrainian forces up to speed on combat first aid and basic tactics, skills they will need in a conflict that has claimed thousands of casualties on both sides.

He noted that the people volunteering have come from all walks of life, including ""veterinarians, dancers, and photographers,"" who all took ""various paths in civilian life"" but decided to pick up arms and defend Ukraine. ""These people are engineers and programmers,"" he said. ""These people are intelligent and craftful people who have been answering their national call to duty due to a fascist invader. ""They’re defending their sovereignty from tyranny and slavery from Russia, and to me this is the most inspiring thing,"" he continued. $40B A U.S. Army veteran is providing combat life saver training to Ukrainian Territorial Defense Forces. The American credited his time in the U.S. military and as a security contractor for giving him the tools he needed to take on the new fight, though he noted several differences between his previous combat experience and the fight in Ukraine. ""The American military, we have amazing air superiority, the best technology,"" he said."" So now I am forced to understand almost what is essentially like an insurgency in some respects. They’re the underdogs. I understand the tactics of an underdog having fought the underdog while being the superior power. ""The sense of hardness that you develop from being on a combat deployment and training and being in this operational mindset prepares you, but it doesn’t prepare you for the level of intensity of combat"" currently going on in Ukraine, he said. But the Army veteran noted the morale and will of the Ukrainian people to fight for their country makes up for what some of them lack in basic combat skills and experience. ’T , ‘ ’ A U.S. Army veteran who served in Iraq trains Ukrainian forces in combatives as the country's war with Russia continues. ""They’ve built up this national identity of who they are so quickly and it has become so united,"" he said. ""The Ukrainian Army doesn’t lack motivation to fight… hundreds of thousands of people are being brought to service."" He noted a lot of the people volunteering for service have ""major gaps"" in their knowledge of basic military tactics and ""usage of modern combat tourniquets and casualty treatment."" But their motivation to fight against a Russian invasion makes them ideal to train. ""They keep asking questions and they want deeper knowledge,"" he said. ""They’re willing to fight to the last man,"" he continued. ""These people will fight to the last man and these people inspire me every day."" The American noted that he will at some point be bound for the front lines himself, where he hopes people back home in the U.S. will continue to be supportive of the Ukrainian war effort. ""The fact that Americans back Ukraine, to them, is the deepest sentiment,"" he said. ""You walk the streets of Ukraine and ask them ‘what do you think of Americans?’ These people will say ‘we love Americans.’ We never got this type of love in Afghanistan, we never got this type of love in Iraq. We’ve never gotten this degree of appreciation from any country."" ""It is imperative that Americans remain engaged in this conflict,"" he continued.

""Several explosions in Darnytskyi and Dniprovskyi districts of the capital,"" Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko wrote on the Telegram messaging app. ""Services are already working on site."" A Reuters witness saw smoke in the city after the explosions. At least one person was hospitalised but no deaths had been reported as of early Sunday, Klitschko said. Other officials said the Russian bombardment appeared to be targeting the railway network. Firefighters douse the fire in the Retroville shopping mall after a Russian attack on the northwest of the capital Kyiv on March 21, 2022. - At least six people were killed in the overnight bombing of a shopping centre in the Ukrainian capital Kyiv, an journalist said, with rescuers combing the wreckage for other victims. The 10-storey building was hit by a powerful blast that pulverised vehicles in its car park and left a crater several metres wide. Despite continuing Russian attacks on Ukraine and the widespread destruction, Kyiv has been relatively calm in recent weeks after Moscow turned its military focus to the east and south, especially an intense battle for Sievierodonetsk. Russia has concentrated its forces on the factory city for one of the biggest ground battles of the war, with Moscow appearing to bet its campaign on capturing one of the two eastern provinces it claims on behalf of separatist proxies. Serhiy Gaidai, the governor of the Luhansk region that includes Sievierodonetsk, said on Sunday Ukrainian forces controlled about half the city after recapturing a large chunk from Russian troops. ""It had been a difficult situation, the Russians controlled 70% of the city, but over the past two days they have been pushed back,"" Gaidai said on Ukraine's television. ""The city is now, more or less, divided in half."" The claims could not be independently verified. Britain's defence ministry said on Sunday that Ukrainian counter-attacks there over the past 24 hours were likely to blunt any operational momentum that Russian forces had previously gained. Moscow said its own forces were making gains in the city. Ukraine's army said Russian forces continued to mount assault operations with the aid of artillery and controlled the eastern part of Sievierodonetsk. ""The situation is tense, complicated,"" Mayor Oleksandr Stryuk told national television on Saturday, saying there was a shortage of food, fuel and medicine. ""Our military is doing everything it can to drive the enemy out of the city."" Both sides claim to have inflicted huge casualties in the fighting, a battle that military experts say could determine which side has the momentum for a prolonged war of attrition in coming months. Ukrainian officials said at least eight people were killed and 11 injured in Russian shelling in the neighboring Donetsk region.

Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba tweeted in response: ""Calls to avoid humiliation of Russia can only humiliate France and every other country that would call for it.

2022-06-04,Fox,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/american-spy-agencies-review-misses-ukraine-russia,"American spy agencies review their misses on Ukraine, Russia","The question was posed in a private briefing to U.S. intelligence officials weeks before Russia launched its invasion in late February: Was Ukraine’s leader, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, made in the mold of Britain’s Winston Churchill or Afghanistan’s Ashraf Ghani? In other words, would Zelenskyy lead a historic resistance or flee while his government collapsed? Ultimately, U.S. intelligence agencies underestimated Zelenskyy and Ukraine while overestimating Russia and its president, even as they accurately predicted Vladimir Putin would order an invasion. But Kyiv, Ukraine's capital, did not fall in a few days, as the United States had expected. And while American spy agencies have been credited with supporting Ukraine's resistance, they now face bipartisan pressure to review what they got wrong beforehand — especially after their mistakes in judging Afghanistan last year. Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines testifies during a Senate Armed Services hearing to examine worldwide threats on Capitol Hill in Washington, May 10, 2022. Intelligence officials have begun a review of how their agencies judge the will and ability of foreign governments to fight. The review is taking place while U.S. intelligence continues to have a critical role in Ukraine and as the White House ramps up weapons deliveries and support to Ukraine, trying to predict what Putin might see as escalatory and seeking to avoid a direct war with Russia. President Joe Biden's administration announced it would give Ukraine a small number of high-tech, medium-range rocket systems, a weapon that Ukraine has long wanted. Since the war began on Feb. 24, the White House has approved shipping drones, anti-tank and anti-aircraft systems, and millions of rounds of ammunition. The U.S. has lifted early restrictions on intelligence-sharing to provide information that Ukraine has used to strike critical targets, including the flagship of the Russian navy. Lawmakers from both parties question whether the U.S. could have done more before Putin invaded and whether the White House held back some support due to pessimistic assessments of Ukraine. Sen. Angus King, an independent from Maine, told officials at a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing last month that ""had we had a better handle on the prediction, we could have done more to assist the Ukrainians earlier."" Ohio Rep. Mike Turner, the top Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, said in an interview that he thought the White House and top administration officials had projected ""their own bias on the situation in a way that lends itself to inaction."" - Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines and Director Lt. General Scott Berrier appear during a Senate Armed Services hearing to examine worldwide threats on Capitol Hill in Washington, May 10, 2022. The Senate Intelligence Committee sent a classified letter last month to the Office of the Director of National Intelligence asking about how intelligence agencies assessed both Ukraine and Afghanistan. first reported the letter. Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines told lawmakers in May that the National Intelligence Council would review how the agencies assess both ""will to fight"" and ""capacity to fight."" Both issues are ""quite challenging to provide effective analysis on, and we’re looking at different methodologies for doing so,"" Haines said. While there is no announced timetable on the review, which began before the committee's letter, officials have identified some errors. Several people familiar with prewar assessments spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive intelligence. Despite its vast advantages, Russia failed to establish air superiority over Ukraine and failed at basic tasks such as securing its battlefield communications. It has lost thousands of soldiers and at least eight to 10 generals, according to U.S. estimates. Russian and Ukrainian forces are now fighting in fierce, close quarters combat in eastern Ukraine, far from the swift Russian victory forecast by the U.S. and the West. While Russia has entered recent proxy wars, it had not directly fought a major land war since the 1980s. That meant many of Russia's projected and claimed capabilities had not been put to the test, posing a challenge for analysts to assess how Russia it would perform in a major invasion, some people said. Russia's active weapons export industry led some people to believe Moscow would have many more missile systems and planes ready to deploy. ‘ ’ : . Russia has not used chemical or biological weapons, as the U.S. publicly warned it might. One official noted that the U.S. had ""very strong concerns"" about a chemical attack, but that Russia may have decided that would cause too much global opposition. Fears that Russia would use a wave of cyberattacks against Ukraine and allies have not materialized so far. A man carries water in front of an apartment building damaged in an overnight missile strike, in Sloviansk, Ukraine, May 31, 2022. Other Russian problems were well-known, including low troop morale, a prevalence of drug and alcohol abuse among troops, and the lack of a noncommissioned officer corps to oversee forces and deliver instructions from commanders. ""We knew all of those things existed,"" said retired Lt. Gen. Robert Ashley, the former director of the Defense Intelligence Agency. ""But it just became a cascading effect of how overwhelming all of that became when they tried to do even the most simple of operations."" Sue Gordon, the former principal deputy director of national intelligence, said analysts may have relied too much on counting Russia's inventory of military and cyber tools. ""We’re going to learn a little bit about how we think about capability and use as not one and the same when you assess outcome,"" she said at a recent event sponsored by The Cipher Brief, an intelligence publication. Zelenskyy has received worldwide acclaim for refusing to flee as Russia sent teams to try to capture or kill him. Britain's Churchill, throughout the yearlong blitz of London by German fighter aircraft during World War , often watched the bombing raids from rooftops, and he made special effort to walk the streets in places where thousands were killed. In contrast, Afghanistan's Ghani slipped out of his country on Sunday last August, lonely and isolated, a few months after America's top diplomat had urged him to forge a united stand as the American military pullout neared. Ghani did not even tell other political leaders who had been negotiating a peaceful transition of power with the Taliban that he was heading for the exit. His sudden and secret departure left Kabul, the capital, rudderless as U.S. and forces were in the final stages of their chaotic withdrawal from the country after 20 years. For Zelenskyy, before the war there were tensions, too, with Washington about the likelihood of a Russian invasion and whether Ukraine was prepared. One flashpoint, according to people familiar with the dispute, was that the U.S. wanted Ukraine to move forces from its west to bolster defenses around Kyiv. Until shortly before the war, Zelenskyy and top Ukrainian officials discounted warnings of an invasion, in part to tamp down public panic and protect the economy. One U.S. official said there was a belief that Zelenskyy had never been tested in a crisis of the level his country was facing. Lt. Gen. Scott Berrier, the current director of the , testified in March that ""my view was that, based on a variety of factors, that the Ukrainians were not as ready as I thought they should be. Therefore, I questioned their will to fight. That was a bad assessment on my part because they have fought bravely and honorably and are doing the right thing."" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy answers media questions during a press conference in a city subway under a central square in Kyiv, Ukraine, April 23, 2022. In May, Berrier distanced his own view from that of the entire intelligence community, which he said never had an assessment ""that said the Ukrainians lacked the will to fight."" There was ample evidence of Ukraine’s determination before the war. Russia’s 2014 annexation of Crimea and the eight-year conflict in the Donbas region had hardened public attitudes against Moscow. Ukrainian forces had received years of training and weapons shipments from the U.S. across several administrations along with help bolstering its cyber defenses. U.S. intelligence had reviewed private polling suggested strong support in Ukraine for any resistance. In Kharkiv, a mostly Russian-speaking city near the border, citizens were learning to fire guns and training for guerrilla warfare. Rep. Brad Wenstrup, a member of the House Intelligence Committee, saw that determination firsthand during a December trip. Wenstrup, R-Ohio, witnessed a military ceremony where participants would read the names of every Ukrainian soldier who had died the previous day on the front lines in the Donbas, the region in eastern Ukraine where Moscow-backed separatists have been fighting Ukrainian government forces since 2014. ""It showed to me that they had a will to fight,"" he said. ""This has been brewing for a long time.""",14,2.983907695876888,3.1853865712762066,-0.20147887539931864,0

The invasion of Ukraine has lasted 100 days, with no end yet in sight as Russia and Ukraine continue to fight for control of eastern Ukraine.

The data indicates that around 6.8 million Ukrainian residents have headed for neighboring countries while an additional 8 million remain displaced within the country itself. The latest count shows that 3,627,178 people went to Poland, 989,357 went to Romania, 971,417 went to Russia, 682,594 went to Hungary, 479,513 went to Moldova, 461,164 went to Slovakia and 30,092 went to Belarus.

Ukrainian emergency employees and volunteers carry an injured pregnant woman from the damaged by shelling maternity hospital in Mariupol, Ukraine, The U.N. can supply rough estimates of civilian casualties, but the numbers of combat casualties on either side of the conflict vary wildly depending on the source. The information war has proven an understandably vital and contentious element of the overall conflict, with both Russia and Ukraine fighting for their narrative to dominate. Both sides have claimed to have killed tens of thousands of enemy combatants: Moscow says its forces have killed around 23,367 Ukrainian troops, while Kyiv counters that its troops have killed around 30,850 Russian troops. - The counterclaims are only fractions of those totals, with Kyiv saying it has lost between 2,500 and 3,000 troops while Moscow insists only 1,351 Russian troops have died in combat. The was only able to confirm 557 of those Russian fatalities and alleged that Ukraine regularly includes the number of injured troops in the losses, which strongly boosts them. Among the confirmed deaths the counted one major-general, seven colonels, one naval captain first rank, nine lieutenant-colonels, 20 majors and 70 junior officers, with the rest holding non-commissioned ranks or only holding the rank of private.

To boost Ukraine’s defenses, the U.S. announced a new spending package of $700 million in military aid, which includes funding for High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems. The latest package adds to the already robust $4.6 billion in military assistance – soon to pale in comparison to the $40 billion aid bill President Biden signed May 21. That bill included $20 billion in military funding. - The latest bill included 1,000 Javelin shoulder-launched rockets, 50 Command Launch Units, 6,000 anti-armor weapons and 15,000 155mm artillery rounds, as well as four helicopters and 15 tactical vehicles. The staggering cost is evident in other areas, too, including extreme economic trouble for Russian citizens. The World Bank has projected Russia’s economy will shrink by approximately 11.2% in 2022, while Ukraine’s economy has already shrunk an estimated 45%. The fighting and economic troubles have threatened the world’s food supply as Russia and Ukraine together account for around 30% of the world’s grain supply. Sanctions against Russia, and the threat of additional sanctions for helping it, have further hurt its trading partners as Central Asian countries struggle with the sudden loss of a major export destination. The war has therefore proven unpopular within Russia as well. Russian watchdog Info had counted 15,446 people arrested at protests held across the country in the first weeks of the war, but the count stopped after Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered severe action against anyone who tried to protest or speak out over the war.

2022-06-02,Fox,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/putin-russia-hack-elections-cyberattack,Putin wants to hack our elections. Here's how we stop it,"Eric Noonan, Cybersheath , joins 'Fox News Live' to discuss the evolving risk of Russian cyberattacks. The biggest near-term question facing America’s national security establishment is clear: When and how will Russia use its considerable offensive cyber capabilities to retaliate against the United States for sweeping sanctions as well as military aid to Ukraine? While it’s extremely difficult to predict how Russian agents may use their cyber weapons against business or even public infrastructure targets abroad, U.S. intelligence experts believe that Putin’s government will continue to engage in the kind of hacking and information warfare in which it has dabbled for years: attempting to interfere with our elections. We can only assume the threat is now greater than ever. Congress and the Biden administration have a range of options—but only a narrow window of time—to fortify our defenses. After all, the next presidential election is just around the corner. To be clear, there’s no evidence that Russia has successfully changed any votes, altered or deleted any voter records, or interfered with any election night reporting in the United States in recent years. However, there’s consensus in the U.S. intelligence community that officials — under Kremlin orders — have sought to interfere in our campaigns and elections. In addition to well-publicized information operations, Russian hackers actually probed elections websites in 21 U.S. states and breached some voter-registration databases. ‘ ’ 2016 As former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper pointed out, Russian interference and disinformation campaigns were a direct response to perceived U.S. interference in Russia’s sphere of influence, including activities in support of Ukraine’s 2014 Revolution of Dignity. Beyond the partisan goals of any Russian interference operations, officials in both the Obama and Trump administrations believe that the objective has been, first and foremost, to undermine faith in America’s electoral institutions. That’s why as policymakers debate options for defending against cyberattacks, one the most important and cost-effective ways to defend ourselves is to harden targets in our election system. Our nation’s leading computer science and internet security specialists and election administrators attest that America needs investments in our nation’s election infrastructure to better ensure security. Over recent years, lawmakers from both parties have coalesced around a common agenda for election cybersecurity, sponsoring legislation to boost funding, improve security standards, ensure the use of paper ballots that provide durable records, and mainstream the use of risk-limiting audits to verify vote counts. While many Democrats have been pushing for paper ballot requirements and election security funding for more than a decade, a growing number of Republicans — including former President Trump — have been vocal in their support for these policies. In December, the leaders of prominent conservative groups — including Americans for Tax Reform, FreedomWorks, R Street Institute, James Madison Institute, and others — sent a letter to Congress calling for more federal funding for election cybersecurity. The crisis with Russia will hopefully prompt Congress to act. A significant investment in election security grants for states would substantially harden election systems as targets. Given that the security of our elections is necessary for our entire society to function, this represents an extremely cost-effective way of defending our critical national security interests. Congress should also make a commitment to offer recurring financial support so that state and local election administrators can count on reliable federal funding when developing their election budgets. The Biden administration also has options for taking immediate action. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas can require that a percentage of Homeland Security grants be used for election-related spending and request chief state election officials be involved grant applications. The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency can also hire more election specialists and boost its programming to make local officials aware of opportunities to strengthen defenses. While Russia’s interest in interfering with U.S. voting is, by this point, ""old news,"" we can’t lose sight of just how devastating a cyber-attack of an election would be to the civic life of our nation. It’s time that we start investing in defenses commensurate with the seriousness of the risk.

But in this nondescript city an hour northeast of Kyiv, Russian forces encountered resistance for the first time, bogging down in the fields as Ukrainian territorial defense forces launched guerrilla attacks on supply lines. The resistance in Borodyanka surprised and confused the Russians, who then provided a preview of the brutal tactics Putin’s forces are using to try and force Ukraine into submission. On March 2, with advancement stalled, the bombings began. Anatoliy Rudnichenko, an advisor to the mayor, was here when his city was relentlessly shelled told Fox News Digital, ""There was no reason for this town to be bombed,"" he said. "" There were no strategic targets, no military here."" 1,000 : A nine-story apartment building is now two separate buildings, the middle part completely demolished by Russian bombs The civilian population in Borodyanka posed no threat. Nonetheless, Russian planes dropped 250kg and 500kg bombs on residential buildings. On the city’s main street, a nine-story block of apartments is now two separate buildings, the middle part completely demolished. Before the war this was a community of 15,000 people and according to local authorities at least 150 were killed, 41 more remain missing, believed to be buried in the rubble. Russian forces held Borodyanka for a month. A woman we spoke to recounted strict measures enforced by troops. ""It was very bad. They were commanding us. It was not like life,"" she said. Russian forces caused major damage to the infrastructure in Borodyanka in Ukraine Ukrainian forces blew up nearby bridges, effectively preventing Russian advancement. Similar battles were underway in Bucha and Irpin. The attack was relentless, night after night residents sought shelter in basements, until on April 2 the Russians withdrew. But not before they mined the city’s parks. Each street and building had to be carefully swept. The damage in Borodyanka is shocking. Blackened buildings stand as a testament to what happened here. Shattered windows offering a glimpse of lives interrupted, in one building jeans and laundry flutter on a clothesline. Aid organizations handing out food to the residents of Borodyanka, Ukraine The supermarket was damaged and has yet to reopen. Many of the 5,000 people who remain here make their way daily to the city’s central square and line up for aid. On this day it’s food from Canada. Bags of long grain rice and small plastic containers of potted meats. The aid organization traveled here from Kyiv and also brings dog and cat food. As one woman walked away, her bag safely stowed under her arm she said ""bring us peace. You can help us, bring us peace."" Investigators from the International Criminal Court are here.

2022-05-23,Fox,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/ukraine-russia-war-kramatorsk,"2 ways Ukraine could win the next battle, and the war","Fox News contributor Dr. Rebecca Grant assesses what the loss of a nearly an entire Russian battalion means on ‘America Reports.’ Forget whoever told you there’s a stalemate in the Ukraine war right now. Mariupol is gone, but a hot fight is raging through eastern Ukraine. It’s Russian artillery versus Ukraine’s hit-and-run counter-offensives, and at several points the battle is touch and go. Much will depend on whether Russia can keep pushing toward the city of Kramatorsk. ‘ ’ ' ' A man carries chairs out of an office on a ground floor of an apartment building destroyed by night shelling in Kramatorsk, Ukraine, on Thursday, May 5. You remember Kramatorsk, where the Russians hit the train station on April 9 with a single ballistic -21 missile strike, killing 57, including five children. Since then, Russian forces have advanced to within about 20 miles of the city. They are even closer to Russia has forces attacking from both the north and south, pressuring cities like Syeverodonetsk. On a map, the curving Russian force position looks like a crocodile’s mouth. Let’s call it the jaws of Kramatorsk. ""The primary objective on this axis is to envelop Ukrainian forces,"" Britain’s Ministry of Defence warned May 13. If Russia succeeds, some of Ukraine’s best forces will be cut off from other units in the West. It’s the highways Putin wants. He’d like to grab the major road systems and snap the jaws shut on Kramatorsk—which was the high-water mark of Russia’s 2014 offensive before Ukraine took it back. Zelenskyy needs to hold around Kramatorsk to keep alive his hopes of pushing Russia out of the east and ultimately, all of Ukraine. Since late April, Ukraine has generated momentum by pushing Russian forces away from Kharkhiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city. Russia is still struggling with battlefield coordination, according to the Pentagon. But there’s no denying Russia has made progress by taking key highway towns like Popasna, which fell May 8. Russian tactics look like World War . The Russian army pounds each town or crossroads with artillery, then makes a frontal attack. If they move too far and fast, Ukraine’s forces strike them. Russia’s pace is ""uneven, slow, incremental, short, and small,"" in the Pentagon’s words May 16, but they have not stopped yet. Despite all this, two factors prove Ukraine’s forces have the tactical ability to win. First, U.S. and artillery and training are taking effect. ""We do believe that the howitzers are having an impact, particularly in Kharkiv,"" the Pentagon said Monday. Second, Ukraine has mastered some very sophisticated tactics. You saw the Russian tanks blown apart in the mud after attempting to cross the Donets river at Bilohorivka last week. That’s right in the crucial area east of Kramatorsk. Now consider the tactics behind it. First, Ukrainians watched the Russians set up to cross the river. Drones provided accurate positions. Then they waited, as the first Russian forces started across, and bunched up like it was the morning rush hour. Finally, Ukraine unleashed precise artillery fire, perhaps with sub-munitions that seek and hit armor. Post-strike pictures showed dozens of Russian vehicles destroyed. Ukraine displayed excellent command and control, and it tells you why Ukraine’s forces have the edge against Russian forces on the move. Who wins at Kramatorsk could also determine the next phase of the war. Mariupol was no big win for Putin. Heartbreaking as the final withdrawal of the soldiers from Azovstal was, it doesn’t dent Ukraine’s growing combat power. ""We hope to save the lives of our boys,"" President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Tuesday. ""Ukraine needs Ukrainian heroes alive."" But if Putin gets Kramatorsk, Russia’s army can take the roads from Izyum to Donetsk, lock down control in the east and consider new options. Russia has 50 Battalion Tactical Groups in the south in position for new operations to landlock Ukraine. If Ukraine holds open the jaws of Kramatorsk, Ukraine can push Russia out of Izyum and start taking back other towns along the 100-mile front. Zelenskyy’s new total victory plan will eventually require Ukraine to increase the pressure, such as by striking Russian military targets in Crimea, for example. It will be much harder to win if Kramatorsk falls. Sadly, Putin has enough oil money to keep up the slow, ugly fight into summer. Ukraine may need two or three more big U.S. aid packages and help from to keep going. Russia’s illegal invasion has brought evil back to Europe. That’s why Sweden is poised to give up over 200 years of neutrality and join . Sweden hasn’t fought a war or joined an alliance since 1814, the era of Napoleon’s wars. Russia’s brutality and threats have changed all that. And it’s not just Putin, who is, obviously, far crazier than we knew. The war in Ukraine daily reveals the sheer barbarism among Russia’s generals. Can you believe President Joe Biden ever thought sanctions would stop the bleeding?",14,3.5409961495012867,2.831730099976776,0.7092660495245107,22

Ukrainian officials acknowledged that the steel plant – which became a symbol for resistance against Russia's invasion – fell this week after 265 soldiers holed up in the plant’s tunnels surrendered to Russian forces, including 52 severely injured soldiers.

The people of the city do their best to re-establish sustainable living Driving through western Ukraine there’s little evidence of war, yet the threat of attack from Russian cruise missiles is constant. Military checkpoints are everywhere, usually constructed of old tires and sandbags, the Ukrainian blue and yellow flag fluttering proudly in gentle spring breezes, mirroring the sky and golden fields or rapeseed that stretch to the horizon. The common site of an army checkpoint on a Ukrainian road. , 3 I’d describe Lviv as a combination of Paris and Rome – its cobblestone streets lined with stately homes over which tower the spires and domes of ancient churches. It’s a city that’s enjoying spring, even in the midst of conflict. Having been here in the cold depths of winter when refugees arrived by the thousands at the train station and people hunkered down in anticipation of Russian attack, it’s surreal to see the city come back to life. The trees are green, the gardens blooming and the cafés and restaurants doing a brisk business. Lviv in western Ukraine can be described as a combination of Paris and Rome. When I was last here a pair of pigeons were in the beginning stages of building a nest in the eaves of the building across from my hotel room. Every day they would busily bring twigs and branches, weaving them together. Six weeks later they nestle upon their new home, oblivious to the war. That’s not to say there aren’t air raid sirens, and authorities constantly remind residents to remain vigilant. 44 : My stay in Lviv was very brief, only one night. Given that Ukrainian forces are currently pushing the Russians back, I departed for Kyiv, traveling by car through the countryside. The roads are very quiet, practically empty but for trucks hauling their loads toward the capital. Due to the war there’s a shortage of gasoline and diesel and the few petrol stations that have fuel have long lines – many waiting hours to fill their empty tanks. Even 150 miles from Kyiv there are checkpoints manned by camouflage-clad soldiers. They gave our vehicle a cursory glance before waving us onward. A destroyed bridge in Kyiv, Ukraine. Approaching Kyiv, you begin to see the first signs of conflict. Not far from Irpin and Bucha, suburbs that bore the brunt of Russian artillery and fierce fighting, buildings lay in ruins, pockmarked with bullets. What remains of an industrial building is a testament to the bombing this area sustained, its steel beams twisted, and its walls charred from a direct hit. Nearby businesses and homes had all their windows blown out, but even here, where so many lost everything, there are signs of life. I saw several people working in their gardens, shovels in hand as they tended to their vegetables. McCONNELL Just a few short miles later and Kyiv could be seen in the distance, an indication of just how close the Kremlin came to taking the capital. Most of the bridges were purposely blown up by the Ukrainians to stall any advance, but reconstruction is already underway. In the meantime, cars negotiate a rutted dirt path and drive over a temporary bridge to access the remaining highway into the city. Much like Lviv, once you’re in Kyiv life appears surprisingly normal with minimal signs of damage. Hedgehogs, welded steel barriers designed to stop tanks, sit unused on the sidewalk near Maidan in the central part of the city. Sandbags continue to line the entrance to the subway where residents who stayed sought shelter. Kyiv is slowly returning to a new normal, all eyes to the east where fighting continues, but with a growing belief that ultimately Ukraine will prevail. Steel barriers line the sidewalk in central Kyiv. At a small supermarket the shelves are well stocked with supplies, though fresh produce is limited. Despite the threat of war there was never any panic buying. People bought what they needed and nothing more, mindful of others. There was always a sense of unity, the understanding they were all in this together. During the 10 weeks I spent here at the beginning of the war I witnessed endless acts of kindness, people opening their homes to strangers who had no place else to go.

He says he personally warned them in January this would happen if Russian troops crossed into Ukraine. Last November, 20% of all Finns wanted to join ; now, nearly 80% want to join, according to recent polls, a dramatic shift in public sentiment after decades of neutrality after World War . ""I think the major change of course was the Russian attack, because the popular mood started to change rapidly after that,"" Hautala said. ""The attack on Ukraine, which was totally illegal. It was unprovoked. I think it shocked the Finns in a profound way because they saw that their neighbor is really capable of such an action."" Russian President Vladimir Putin, left, and Finland's President Sauli Niinisto, right. Today as the Swedish Parliament debated whether to join , the shift in tone from Vladimir Putin was as surprising as the decision of Finland and Sweden to apply to join after decades of neutrality in the wake of Russia's invasion. Putin said unless built bases in Sweden and Finland and put permanent troops there, Russia would not have a problem with Finland and Sweden joining . ""As far as expansion - new members Finland and Sweden included - Russia - I would like to remind you, dear colleagues - doesn't have any problem with those countries,"" Putin said to six former Soviet States marking the 30th Anniversary of the Collective Security Treaty Organization. ""Therefore, there is not an immediate threat to Russia with the inclusion of those countries. But the expansion of military infrastructure over that territory will obviously call for our response."" Some Russian spokesmen have threatened to deploy nuclear weapons to Finland’s border if Finland joins . Today Putin responded with a more subdued and nuanced warning. ‘ A ’ , Finland's President called Putin Saturday to tell him that his country planned to join after decades of neutrality. ""In my opinion, the membership is an act of peace, it's about war never returning to Finland,"" Finnish Prime Minister Sanna Marin told Parliament. Sweden’s Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson told Parliament: ""Should Sweden be the only country in the Baltic Sea region that was not a member of , we would be in a very vulnerable position, we can't rule out that Russia would then increase pressure on Sweden."" Finland’s Ambassador to the U.S. said of Russia’s response: ""They have always said that they would react in some way. Most likely they will place more military resources close to the Finnish border."" ""Nuclear weapons,"" Fox News asked? ""I don't see that as a kind of a major issue here,"" Hautala said. ""Finland has a large number of nuclear bunkers. Are you preparing those bunkers,"" I ask. ""They have been built and prepared and they stay ready."" Unlike most pending applications to , the ambassador says Finland would not be a drain financially to the alliance. ""We fulfill all the criteria that you can imagine. We are a well established democracy. We are among the best rule of law countries. We are the least corrupted country in the world,"" Hautala said. ""We have never dismantled our armed services. Finland brings more resources, they will bring added value to the alliance. We have a lot a lot of military capabilities in relation to our size."" Finland is already spending more than 2 percent of its on defense, unlike many members. ""We have a large army. We have a modern Air Force. I think one of the best in Europe. We have a huge artillery. I think it can be even the biggest one after Russia. It's really, it's really strong. 76% of our population is ready to defend our country militarily, regardless of the outcome."" Some of the ambassador's most sensitive, and classified discussions with other diplomats and American officials take place in his sauna in northwest Washington, D.C., where frank discussions can be had and there is no place to hide listening devices. This is where he makes his opponents sweat, he joked as he showed Fox News his sauna. At the entrance is a photograph of the father of modern Finland General Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim. Hautala spent his formative years as a young diplomat in Ukraine - he is fluent in Russian and Ukrainian. ""I basically fell in love with the place."" He recalls a particular evening in early 2000 when one Friday evening at a restaurant on a main street in Kyiv, he was packed into a restaurant with other Ukrainians. ""Suddenly, there was a silence. Total silence. A man came in with the Russian Ministry of Interior camouflage uniform. So he had a Russian flag and a Russian emblem. I noticed the people went silent. And everybody was looking at that guy."" Hautala added he took a mental note: ""People started to stare. And I sort of made a mental note that this country is developing kind of an identity a sense of its own."" The Finnish ambassador grew up with the stories of his grandfather, a Finnish farmer, deployed to the trenches on the border with Russia fighting the Russian invasion of Finland in 1939 at the start of World War during what became known as the Winter War. It was 45 degrees below zero Fahrenheit. The Finns pushed the Russians back and the Russians signed a ceasefire after three months. ""They were farmers, just ordinary people. They were very patriotic,"" Hautala said. ""One of the myths in Russia about Finland is that we used to have snipers in trees.""

A former mercenary with the notorious Kremlin-linked Wagner Group claimed that Russia was ill-prepared for its war in Ukraine, reports said Friday. Russia failed to take Kyiv despite weeks of attempts by Russian forces to attack the capital city from three different directions. Moscow has instead focused its current efforts on eastern and southern Ukraine. - This undated photograph handed out by French military shows three Russian mercenaries, right, in northern Mali. Russia has engaged in under-the-radar military operations in at least half a dozen countries in Africa in the last five years using a shadowy mercenary force analysts say is loyal to President Vladimir Putin. The analysts say the Wagner Group of mercenaries is also key to Putin's ambitions to re-impose Russian influence on a global scale. ""They were caught completely by surprise that the Ukrainian army resisted so fiercely and that they faced an actual army,"" Marat Gabidullin told Reuters. The former mercenary, who now resides in France, said Moscow underestimated Ukraine’s fighting force which has been training with U.S. and troops since Russia’s 2014 invasion. ""I told them: 'Guys, that's a mistake',"" Gabidullin, reportedly said upon turning down a request to return to the group and fight in Ukraine. Gabidullin fought with the Wagner Group on Moscow’s behalf during missions in Syria and a previous conflict in Ukraine – though it is unclear if he assisted Russian forces in the 2014 annexation of Crimea. The former mercenary alleged that he turned down the offer because he did not agree with the Kremlin’s position on invading Ukraine this time around. - Ukrainian soldiers rest at their position near Lyman, eastern Ukraine, on April 28, 2022, amid Russian invasion of Ukraine. The Wagner Group is a paramilitary organization with known ties to the Kremlin, despite Moscow’s repeated claims that the Russian government is not affiliated with the group. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told Reuters that he did not know of Gabidullin or whether he had previously fought with the Wagner Group. ""We, the state, the government, the Kremlin cannot have anything to do with it,"" he said. Ukraine has reported that Russian troops have taken serious losses and have even resorted to decades-old ammunitions like ""dumb bombs"" as it struggles to re-equip its forces. Russia allotted roughly $66 billion for its defense budget in 2021, but the amount of military aid being provided by the U.S. and allies could spell trouble for Moscow’s military success in Ukraine. It is unclear how much defense aid Russia has allotted for its war in Ukraine for the 2022 fiscal year. Ukrainian soldiers are seen near the recently collapsed bridge which was the target of a Russian missile, near the town of Irpin, Ukraine on March 3, 2022. But according to records on Russia’s defense budget in the lead-up to its 2014 invasion, Moscow ramped up its arms in apparent preparation – a move it does not appear to have done for its 2022 campaign. Between 2010 and 2013 Russia increased its defense allotment by nearly $30 billion with a budget of over $88 billion in 2013. But between 2015 and 2021, there was no significant increase in its defense budget, allotting less than $66 billion in 2021.

Leaders say it is expected to replace the Stryker Brigade in the state with a more mobile infantry unit. ""I think right now the purpose of Army forces in Alaska is much more about creating an extreme cold weather capable formation"" that could be used in Europe or the Indo-Pacific, Army Secretary Christine Wormuth told The Associated Press. ""We’re trying to get to a place where we have Arctic capable forces — forces that can survive and operate in that environment."" She said she expects to make a final decision about the troop change soon, including likely converting the Stryker unit to an infantry brigade. - Capt. Corey Wheeler, front, commander of B Company, 1st Battalion, 52nd Aviation Regiment at Fort Wainwright, Alaska, walks away from a Chinook helicopter that landed on the glacier near Denali, April 24, 2016, on the Kahiltna Glacier in Alaska. The 1st Stryker Brigade Combat Team, 25th Infantry Division, would be converted to a light infantry brigade. The unit and the division's 4th Infantry Brigade Combat team would become the 11th Airborne Division, based in Alaska. Wormuth said that Stryker vehicles would be replaced by some that are more suitable for the terrain. ""I think it really makes sense to have forces trained in the Arctic environments that they would be used for,"" she said. ""If we’re going to have ground forces in Alaska, that’s what we need them to be able to do. They can’t get that experience going to the Mojave Desert or to Fort Polk."" - 1M -19 The revisions were under consideration before Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February. Any final decision would need approval from Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin. ""If you’re going to do big movements of equipment and things like that, the summer is a pretty important window because it’s a lot easier to move vehicles around than doing it in the dead of winter,"" Wormuth explained, telling members of Congress that the Army would offset Stryker losses by increasing the size and capabilities of the headquarters. Secretary of the Army Christine Wormuth, testifies before a Senate Armed Services committee hearing to examine the posture of the Department of the Army in review of the Defense Authorization Request for fiscal year 2023 and the Future Years Defense Program, Thursday, May 5, 2022, on Capitol Hill in Washington. The U.S., Wormuth said, has previously resisted moves to militarize the Arctic, even as Russia has expanded its military presence there. Wormuth wondered if that mindset will be revisited in the near future. In April, the secretary watched an Army brigade wage war against fictional ""Denovian"" forces from California's dusty Mojave Desert. ""I think right now the whole Army is really looking at what’s happening in Ukraine and trying to learn lessons,"" said remarked then. ""As we’re watching what’s happening to the Russians now, it’s informative for us to think about what is right, from a modernization standpoint,"" she said, noting that some U.S. tanks are very heavy and that Europe is muddier.

In the lead-up to the incursion, Russia repeatedly demanded that block Ukraine from joining the military alliance and deny it access to the Article 5 statute – which says that an attack on one nation will trigger a response from the entire alliance.

If Finland’s president and the governing Social Democrats in both countries come out in favor of accession in the next few days, could soon add two members right on Russia’s doorstep. That would be a historic development for the two Nordic countries: Sweden has avoided military alliances for more than 200 years, while Finland adopted neutrality after being defeated by the Soviet Union in World War . membership was never seriously considered in Stockholm and Helsinki until Russian forces attacked Ukraine on Feb. 24. Virtually overnight, the conversation in both capitals shifted from ""Why should we join?"" to ""How long does it take?"" Along with hard-nosed Ukrainian resistance and wide-ranging Western sanctions, it’s one of the most significant ways in which the invasion appears to have backfired on Russian President Vladimir Putin. If Finland and Sweden join the alliance, Russia would find itself completely surrounded by countries in the Baltic Sea and the Arctic. - Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, center, participates in a media conference with Finland's Foreign Minister Pekka Haavisto, left, and Sweden's Foreign Minister Ann Linde, right, at headquarters in Brussels, Jan. 24, 2022.

The governing Social Democratic parties in both countries are set to present their positions this weekend. If their answer is ""yes,"" there would be robust majorities in both parliaments for membership, paving the way for formal application procedures to begin right away. The Finnish Social Democrats led by Prime Minister Sanna Marin are likely to join other parties in Finland in endorsing a application. The situation in Sweden isn’t as clear. The Swedish Social Democrats have always been staunchly committed to nonalignment, but party leader and Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson has said there’s a clear ""before and after Feb. 24."" - Russian President Vladimir Putin, right, and Finnish President Sauli Niinisto talk during their meeting in the Kremlin in Moscow, Russia, Oct. 29, 2021.

The question of whether to join is coming to a head in Finland and Sweden, where Russia's invasion of Ukraine has shattered the long-held belief that remaining outside the military alliance was the best way to avoid trouble with their giant neighbor. After remaining firmly against membership for decades, public opinion in both countries shifted rapidly this year. Polls show more than 70% of Finns and about 50% of Swedes now favor joining. The shocking scenes playing out in Ukraine made Finns draw the conclusion that ""this could happen to us,"" said Charly Salonius-Pasternak, a researcher at the Finnish Institute of International Affairs. During the Cold War, Finland stayed away from to avoid provoking the Soviet Union, while Sweden already had a tradition of neutrality dating to the end of the Napoleonic Wars. But both countries built up robust conscription-based armed forces to counter any Soviet threat. Sweden even had a nuclear weapons program but scrapped it in the 1960s. : The threat of a conflict flared up in October 1981 when a Soviet submarine ran aground off the coast of southwestern Sweden. Eventually the sub was tugged back out to sea, ending a tense standoff between Swedish forces and a Soviet rescue fleet. As Russia’s military power declined in the 1990s, Finland kept its guard high, while Sweden, considering a conflict with Russia increasingly unlikely, downsized its military and shifted its focus from territorial defense toward peacekeeping missions in faraway conflict zones. Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014 prompted the Swedes to reassess the security situation. They reintroduced conscription and started rebuilding defensive capabilities, including on the strategically important Baltic Sea island of Gotland. Defense analysts say Finland and Sweden have modern and competent armed forces that would significantly boost ’s capabilities in Northern Europe. Finnish and Swedish forces train so often with that they are essentially interoperable. Adding new members typically takes months, because those decisions need to be ratified by all 30 members.

Russia has not shown its full cyberwarfare capabilities, but the U.S. should remain confident in its own cyber defense, experts told Fox News Digital. ""I think that the concern is that they may have capabilities that we don't know about,"" Mark Stamford, Cybersecurity Expert and Founder of OccamSec, said. ""And until such point, as they need to use them, we may never know."" Much of the conversation regarding Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has understandably focused on the physical siege and assault on Kyiv, Mariupol and other cities, but the cyberwar started before any Russian troops stepped foot in Ukraine. : The country suffered a number of hacks in the days leading up to Russia’s invasion, with cybersecurity firm finding a ""data wiping program"" that hit hundreds of machines just a week ahead of the invasion. Since the invasion started, hacking collective Anonymous declared war on Russia, and Ukraine has continued to suffer cyberattacks from Russian agents. But the full scope of Russia’s capabilities remains a mystery since their targets are not operating on the same technological level.

New York, - October 5, 2016: A Homeland Security vehicle late in the day in Lower Manhattan. ""The thing is that if I don't need to use my latest and greatest attack, why should I?"" Stamford explained. ""There's no need for me to do something brand new when I can just do something old that works great."" The concern lies in the nature of cyberwarfare itself: Unlike conventional weapons which can be damaged and destroyed after their use, a cyberweapon – such as data wiping programs or viruses – can be replicated and repurposed and spread. ""If you look back to stuff like the WannaCry and NotPetya events ... bad guys took them, tweaked them and throw them right back at you, so we get into this dangerous situation where if Russia did decide to use something that we hadn't seen before, somebody else would undoubtedly get hold of it, do some research, break apart, figure out what they could do with it,"" Stamford said. 'S : ‘ ’ - The issue grows more complicated due to the fact that Moscow appears to operate with a model that allows free reign for individual operators to attack foreign targets without explicit direction or acknowledgment from the government. The U.S. has faced a few different hacking crises that officials tied back to Russian actors, such as the SolarWinds hack - tied to hackers acting at the direction of Russia's intelligence service - and the Colonial Pipeline hack - believed to be the act of a lone Russian hacker that local police arrested. Putin also recently signed an initiative to bolster Russia's cyber defenses, which former defense official James Anderson said could be a move to further entangle state and business enterprises in the country. ""The public effort to ban Russia from using cyber security tools from ""unfriendly countries"" appears, at least in part, to be a face-saving measure, since many major Western technology firms have already withdrawn from the Russian market in response to Moscow's brutish invasion of Ukraine,"" Anderson explained. ""In addition to helping Russia to better protect itself from hackers, the cyber security decree probably reflects Putin's desire to further extend his authoritarian tentacles, since state corporations and other strategically important enterprises will be required to provide the state's security services with ""unhindered access to information resources."" , But the U.S. should remain confident in its ability to defend against attacks from foreign actors, especially with the implementation of quantum computing, according to Martin Moore, a retired Special Forces Sergeant Major and Owner of ZeroOneAngus . ""I think quantum computing and having that post-quantum encryption is better than relying on a firewall to protect us - that is a higher priority,"" Moore said. ""A firewall can only protect traffic and data leaks. We need protection and systems that don't have back and side doors build in."" Quantum computing simply allows for an increase in the already incredible number of calculations a machine could make, going through ""a million keys"" in moments. ' The U.S. may not provide a national firewall in the way that Russia and China have aimed to do, but companies and government agencies can start to wrap quantum encryption around what is already ""robust"" encryption that is widely used. The Department of Homeland Security leads the national effort to improve cybersecurity through the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency . Moore attributes the success of American companies to their approach, which assumes that companies and users operate in a ""zero trust environment."" ""We know everything is vulnerable and it's always going to be vulnerable and we have to stay ahead of that, and it's tough to stay ahead of that when there's so many variables at play,"" Moore said. ""So I think developing a system that cannot be penetrated is going to be almost impossible."" ""We have to put more effort into understanding the threat and the potential threat and doing something about it, because we think that even though we think we're secure, we're not,"" he added.

Pope Francis arrives to attend his weekly general audience in the Paul Hall at the Vatican April 13, 2022. He also questioned if everything possible was being done to bring about an end to the fighting through dialogue.

2022-04-26,Fox,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/putin-strategic-nightmare-judith-miller,Putin may soon face one of his worst strategic nightmares,"Acting U.S. Ambassador to Finland Ian Campbell discusses Finland’s move towards joining amid nuclear threats from Russia on ‘Cavuto.’ Despite over two months of trying to bloody and bomb Ukraine into submission to prevent its strategic drift to the west, Vladimir Putin may soon face one of his worst strategic nightmares: the alliance he despises is about to get larger and stronger. And not a minute too soon. Last week, Sweden’s and Finland’s opposition leaders met with Biden officials in Washington to seek U.S. support for their desire to join . Petteri Orpo, the head of Finland’s center-right National Coalition Party, and Ulf Kristersson, the leader of the opposition in parliament who heads Sweden’s Moderate Party, met with senior Biden administration officials and congressional staffers to press for support of an expanded . While both have long favored membership, strong public support at home for the Nordic states’ long-standing policy of military non-alignment made that unlikely. But public and political sentiment shifted dramatically on Feb. 24th when Putin invaded Ukraine. - Russian President Vladimir Putin. Orpo told Foreign Policy magazine it was now ""clear"" that Finland’s parliament would decide to apply to join next month. Kristersson said that after a debate, Sweden, which fears being left out of the alliance should Finland join, was likely to do the same. Last Wednesday, membership was endorsed by Aftonbladet, the newspaper of Sweden’s largest social democratic party, which argued that Putin’s brutal invasion of Ukraine had changed Sweden’s security situation. ’S If both Nordic countries join , the length of the border that separates Russia from the alliance will instantly double. While a stronger, expanded will not undo Ukraine's enormous suffering -- the country' thousands of deaths and the millions of refugees and displaced, the wanton destruction of its villages and cities -- forcing Putin to accept the enlargement of the alliance he has been determined to divide and weaken is the beginning of payback for his war crimes and wanton aggression. In an interview, Kai Sauer, Finland’s Under-Secretary of State for Foreign and Security Policy, said it was likely that his country would apply for membership in the coming weeks partly because of the shift in public opinion. ""A huge majority of the population now favors membership – close to 70 percent,"" he said. Plus, the strongest political parties that once opposed membership now favor it. Sauer said that Putin has made the same wrong assumption about Ukraine that Stalin made in 1939 when he invaded neighboring Finland. ""Stalin expected little resistance, but the invasion managed to unite the country against him."" From November, 1939, to March, 1940, Finland stunned and inspired the world as its much smaller army held at bay Stalin’s invading force of nearly half a million men and 1,500 tanks. Though the Red Army finally overwhelmed the Finns, Russia lost more than 150,000 men in the ""Winter War."" ""This could be history repeating itself,"" Sauer said. , : The Nordic states more than qualify for membership. Both have highly professional militaries with advanced capabilities on sea, land and air, according to a recent assessment by the Washington-based think tank, . – Sept. 19, 2019: President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy and President of the Republic of Finland Sauli Niinistö walk down the red carpet. Though Finland’s military is relatively small – some 12,000 – the figure does not include its strong border guard, or the fact that its forces are backed by some 280,000 current conscripts and reservists. Moreover, Sauer noted, Finland now spends nearly 2 percent of its on defense, the target, but which few of the alliance's 30 members actually meet. Finland would also bring to the alliance ""one of the largest artilleries in Europe"" and its formidable technological expertise. Two out of three of the world’s top telecommunications companies are Finnish or Swedish. Finland is also purchasing 64 F-35's. Alexander Vershbow, a former ambassador to Russia and former Deputy Secretary General of , said that as early members of the Partnership for Peace, both nations attend summits and high level meetings. Their military forces are highly integrated into ’s capabilities. ""They are at the table,"" he said. Their joining would strengthen the alliance’s capabilities. But it would also mean that ""would be taking on the additional defense requirement of having to defend their long borders."" Politically, he added, their admission ""would greatly annoy Putin."" Vershbow foresees two challenges, and yes, both are daunting. First is how best to provide interim security guarantees so that Russia doesn’t attack them between their candidacy and becoming actual members, a process that usually takes well over a year. Second, one or more of the members might object. Germany, for one, might fear antagonizing Russia and reducing the prospects of peace talks and a negotiated settlement of the conflict. Or, Viktor Orban, Hungary’s newly re-elected prime minister, might ""drag his feet"" under Russian pressure. Such a potential crisis was averted Sunday in France’s presidential election, when President Emmanuel Macron defeated his right-wing challenger Marine Le Pen, who had vowed to take France out of 's allied command and has consistently defended Putin and Moscow’s policies. Vershbow said Finland and Sweden would likely act soon so they could be invited to begin accession talks at the summit in June. ""But we mustn’t begin a fast track accession that runs aground, ""he said. ""That would become an opportunity, rather than a crisis for Putin."" Moscow has warned both countries that Russia will deploy nuclear weapons in the Baltic region if Finland and Sweden abandon non-alignment. But Russia already has nuclear installations in its Kaliningrad region, less than 500 miles from Helsinki and Stockholm. And military analysts say neither Sweden nor Finland, which has an 800 mile-long border with Russia, has much to fear. Pete Dordal, Jr, the president of GardaWorld Federal Services, which provides security globally, said that in his personal view, the Nordic states’ strategic shift was a ""minor annoyance"" for Putin, who is totally focused on his ""all or nothing"" strategy in Ukraine. ""It’s pretty evident that Russia is struggling just to support the invasion of Ukraine, which is not going very impressively,"" said Gen. David Petraeus, the former director who is now a partner at . ""Given the enormous contributions of weapons system, ammunition, vehicles, and drones, as well as other military equipment from the U.S. and other countries, it is not inconceivable that Ukraine could actually begin to counter-attack in the weeks ahead.

Moldovan President Maia Sandu, in response, has called for a meeting Tuesday of the country’s Supreme Security Council. Authorities stand guard in front of radio antennas in Maiac following the blasts Tuesday. Last week, Russian Major Gen.

President Volodymyr Zelenskyy announced the planned visit by U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin during a lengthy Saturday night news conference held in a Kyiv subway station. The White House has not commented. Zelenskyy said he was looking for the Americans to produce results, both in terms of arms and security guarantees. ""You can’t come to us empty-handed today, and we are expecting not just presents or some kind of cakes, we are expecting specific things and specific weapons,″ he said. The visit would be the first by senior U.S. officials since Russia invaded Ukraine 60 days ago. Blinken stepped briefly onto Ukrainian soil in March to meet with the country’s foreign minister during a visit to Poland. Zelenskyy’s last face-to-face meeting with a U.S. leader was Feb. 19 in Munich with Vice President Kamala Harris. The meeting was set to take place as Ukrainians and Russians observed Orthodox Easter, celebrating the resurrection of Jesus Christ and considered the most joyful holiday on the Christian calendar. Speaking Sunday from the ancient St. Sophia Cathedral, Zelenskyy, who is Jewish, highlighted the allegorical significance of the occasion to a nation wracked by nearly two months of war. Worshippers light candles at St. Volodymyr's Cathedral during Orthodox Easter celebrations in Kyiv, Ukraine, Sunday, April 24, 2022.

Earlier, during his nightly address to the nation, Zelenskyy claimed that intercepted communications recorded Russian troops discussing ""how they conceal the traces of their crimes"" in Mariupol. The president also highlighted the death of a 3-month old girl in a Russian missile strike Saturday on the Black Sea port of Odesa. , , Zelenskyy said that equipment from Western supporters had been a big help so far, but he also has stressed that Ukraine needs more heavy weapons, including long-range air defense systems and warplanes to fend off the Russian attacks. The Russian military reported that it hit 423 Ukrainian targets overnight, including fortified positions and troop concentrations, while Russian warplanes destroyed 26 Ukrainian military sites, including an explosives factory and several artillery depots. Most of the fighting Sunday focused on the eastern Donbas region, where Ukrainian forces are concentrated and where Moscow-backed separatists controlled some territory before the war. Since failing to capture Kyiv, the Russians are aiming to gain full control over Ukraine’s eastern industrial heartland. Russian forces launched fresh airstrikes on a Mariupol steel plant, where an estimated 1,000 civilians are sheltering along with about 2,000 Ukrainian fighters. The Azovstal steel mill where the defenders are holed up is the last corner of resistance in the city, which the Russians have otherwise occupied.

He urged Russia to allow civilians to leave the plant and suggested talks to negotiate an exit for the Ukrainian soldiers. Podolyak tweeted that the Russian military was attacking the plant with heavy bombs and artillery while accumulating forces and equipment for a direct assault. Mariupol has been the focus of fierce fighting since the start of the war due to its location on the Sea of Azov. Its capture would deprive Ukraine of a vital port, free up Russian troops to fight elsewhere, and allow Moscow to establish a land corridor to the Crimean Peninsula, which it seized from Ukraine in 2014. More than 100,000 people — down from a prewar population of about 430,000 — are believed to remain in Mariupol with scant food, water or heat. Ukrainian authorities estimate that over 20,000 civilians have been killed. Satellite images released this week showed what appeared to be mass graves dug in towns to the west and east of Mariupol. Zelenskyy accused the Russians of committing war crimes by killing civilians, as well as of setting up ""filtration camps"" near Mariupol for people caught trying to leave the city. From there, he said, Ukrainians are sent to areas under Russian occupation or to Russia itself, often as far as Siberia or the Far East. Many of them, he said, are children.

2022-04-22,Fox,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/russian-cyber-threat-nato-jason-blessing,The Russian cyber threat is here to stay and NATO needs to understand it,"Rep. Jake Auchincloss, D-Mass., on how the U.S. could support Ukraine during Russia’s invasion. Since the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the Biden administration has escalated warnings about likely Russian cyber-attacks on American infrastructure and business. More worrying still, cyber alarmists like Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Mark Warner, D-Va., have suggested that cyber-attacks from the Kremlin could be acts of war that trigger ’s collective defense. This sky-is-falling delusion, particularly from leaders with access to classified intelligence, is at best counterproductive and at worst dangerous. Cyber-attacks are rarely acts of war, and treating them as if they are undermines ’s ability to deal with real threats short of cyber war. , has only invoked Article 5 – which triggers a collective response – once and that was after the 9/11 attacks. Cyber-attacks are unlikely to destroy buildings and kill thousands in an instant. While collective defense extends to cyberspace, few operations could realistically be a cause for war. This would include cyber-attacks resulting in death or damage like traditional military operations or coordinated assaults that take the power grid or entire economic sectors offline. These scenarios are unlikely though: such attacks require far too much time, funding, manpower, and control. Instead, most attacks temporarily overwhelm servers with traffic, deny network access, hold computers hostage, and steal or delete data. Building cyber resilience is an important step forward. It acknowledges that, in many cases, the Russians will get the best of us in cyberspace. Even if allies wanted to trigger Article 5 over cyber operations, disagreements about the definitions of threats, origins of attacks, and pain thresholds in cyberspace can derail the process. 'S ' ' Collective retaliation requires a unanimous vote across ; building unity across these points is nearly impossible for most cyber activity. Unlike missile attacks or tanks in the streets, few ""red lines"" exist to distinguish cybercrime, cyber espionage, and cyber disruption from digital acts of war. Beyond the bureaucratic and logistical limitations of elevating cyber to a casus belli, focusing on cyber-attacks as acts of war distracts from the more likely Russian digital assaults below the level of armed conflict. These include ransomware attacks and supply chain infiltrations that look like criminal activity or espionage. The Kremlin is particularly adept at the latter. In the SolarWinds compromise, Russia hacked one company’s software product to access networks of Fortune 500 companies and U.S. government agencies. Spillover from operations in Ukraine poses an additional risk. The Russians have already deployed several digital tools to destroy computer data, resulting in corrupted computers for Ukrainian companies with government support roles. The same malicious software has also affected several Latvian and Lithuanian businesses. Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg speaks to the press ahead of a meeting of foreign ministers at headquarters, in Brussels, Belgium, Nov. 26, 2021. The danger is another situation like NotPetya in 2017, where malware self-replicated, spread past Ukrainian targets to cripple networks in over 150 countries, and created $10 billion in damages. Each of these scenarios are much more likely than a ""cyber doomsday"" that would justify an Article 5 response from members. To be fair, policymakers’ fears of cyber war have led to some positive developments for the alliance. For instance, over the last several years, has developed its own framework for combining cyber and conventional military capabilities in warfighting. But allies remain unprepared to deal with ""death by 1000 cuts"" in cyberspace. Concentrating only on acts of war comes at the expense of addressing the cumulative costs of low-level cyber threats over time. It leads to an overreliance on cyber deterrence or defensive whack-a-mole strategies, neither of which are sustainable. Threats of retaliation simply don’t deter most cyber-attacks, and it is unrealistic for defensive measures to stop every hacker. Policymakers across must acknowledge that security failures are the norm in cyberspace, and that the compounding costs of failure over time are every bit as dangerous as the threat of cyber war. Building cyber resilience is an important step forward. It acknowledges that, in many cases, the Russians will get the best of us in cyberspace. The focus is on controlling failures to limit damage and quickly get networks back online. Moving from buzzword to actual strategy requires addressing several questions. Which digital assets are most significant? Where is the alliance most exposed to Russian cyber-attacks? Where should reduce operating risks, and in what areas can it assume more? How can allies track long-term trends and adapt to new technologies? The Russian cyber threat is here to stay. Collective defense is – and should remain – the cornerstone of . But time is running out for the alliance to protect itself from scenarios that aren’t all-out cyber war.",3,5.847842046369221,6.375064228179394,-0.5272221818101723,7

2022-04-18,Fox,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/russia-putin-ukraine-war-bob-maginnis,Russia's Putin isn't finished in Ukraine,"Fox News correspondent Trey Yingst provides live updates of the Russia-Ukraine war and the impending investigation of suspected war crimes committed by Russia on 'Your World.' General Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs, testified that the war in Ukraine is likely to go on for ""years."" What are the indicators that war could last ""years"" and what might be the consequences for the West? Predicting how long a war might last isn’t a precise science. In August 1914, German Emperor Wilhelm promised his deploying troops they would be home before winter. Meanwhile, his Chief of the German General Staff predicted what became the First World War would last up to two years. An armed serviceman of Donetsk People's Republic militia walks past a building damaged during fighting in Mariupol on Wednesday. Soon both German leaders faced a new reality. The ensuing fight pitted two great alliance blocs, the Triple Entente and the Triple Alliance, involved millions of soldiers, consumed the lifeblood of entire nations, and ultimately lasted four and a half years. The costs of that ""War to End All Wars,"" which involved more than 100 countries were staggering: as much as $337 billion in direct and indirect costs. The human toll was equally sobering: 12 million dead and 20 million severely wounded. Seven weeks into the Ukraine war, no one is predicting the fight will mushroom into World War much less be as expensive and bloody as the First World War. However, it’s clear that Moscow isn’t finished and the toll in blood and treasure will grow. Russian President Vladimir Putin appears to have abandoned his hopes of capturing Ukraine’s capital city of Kyiv and is now focused on the Donbas and Luhansk regions. Russian movements suggest their forces hope to encircle the Ukrainian army’s most capable combat units in the east and force a surrender, destroying any hope Kyiv has of regaining control over the east. So, given Putin’s changed plans, what are the indicators that persuaded General Milley that the war is likely to last ""years""? First, Russia appears to have adopted a new, harsher strategy. President Putin replaced his field commander seeking different results, no matter how long it takes. He selected Gen. Alexander Dvorikov, a man known as the ""Butcher of Syria,"" to oversee the fresh assault on Ukraine. However, there is a problem for Russia with a new albeit harsher strategy. Time is not on their side. Khrystyna Holynska, a defense and security policy researcher reminds us ""This is still the same Russian military with low morale, distrust in the ranks, weapons systems and logistics problems, and many other issues that have been widely discussed"" and they ""cannot be solved quickly."" Second, due to heavy losses in tanks and troops, Putin has dipped into his reserves, a pool of two million men, to mobilize 20 Russian National Guard units. This is the first time the Rosgvardiya has been mobilized for anything other than rear area operations. Calling up these units and putting them into the fight indicates Moscow’s forces are severely stretched, or he’s holding back his best fighters for other operations, perhaps evidence of fighting elsewhere. Third, the Ukrainians are taking the fight to Russia, which could extend the war. Russian regional authorities along Ukraine’s border increased the terrorism threat level because of the presence of Ukrainian special operations forces intent on sabotage attacks. For example, on April 1st a Ukrainian Mi-24 helicopter attacked a Russian oil depot in Belgorod and again on April 12th a railroad track inside Russia leading to Kharkov, Ukraine was sabotaged, another indicator of Kyiv’s intent. Fourth, the Ukrainians will long hold a grudge against Russia for their war crimes, which will likely extend the fighting.The Ukrainians surprised the Russians with their resilience, but it is the Russian atrocities, such as in Bucha, that will fuel their anger against Moscow for decades to come. Fifth, the longevity of the war is directly tethered to continued Western support to Ukraine such as the flow of arms. Military assistance to Ukraine is pouring in from the West to sustain the Ukrainian fight. Slovakia is providing S-300 air defense systems, the Czech Republic is sending T-72 tanks and the is sending thousands of Javelin anti-armor weapons, artillery and radars, and more than a thousand Stinger shoulder-fired surface-to-air missiles along with hundreds of Switchblade suicide drones. Regardless of Ukraine’s efforts and the West’s flow of arms, Moscow is ultimately capable of committing more assets than Ukraine which means over time the Kremlin’s mass could ultimately crush Ukraine’s better tactics, and home field advantage, especially should the West grow weary of financing that war. Finally, Putin calculates that he can resource a long war thanks to two key Russian exports, energy and grain. The West’s crippling sanctions are failing to break Moscow’s ambitions to sustain its ""Special Military Operation."" In fact, Russia expects to earn almost $10 billion in additional revenue from energy sales in April 2022, thanks to high oil prices. Further, the Biden administration’s sanctions will ""… not affect this war in the short run, because Russia’s military is fighting with tanks it had already built and soldiers it had already trained,"" said, Johan Norberg, an analyst at the Swedish Defense Research Agency. Besides, Moscow can comfortably pay for the war because it can simply commandeer resources like fuel from state-owned companies. These indicators can be understood as prolonging the war. Alternatively, Russia’s new focus could position Putin to claim a quick ""victory"" followed by a ceasefire along a new line of control in Donbas. Then Putin celebrates his ""victory"" at the annual May 9th World War Victory Day celebration at the Kremlin. Whether the fight continues for years or is cut short, there are long-term questions for the West which require answers. Will permanently station forces along Russia’s border to make it clear the West will not tolerate more aggression? Will the European Union wean itself off Russian fuel to deny Putin the means to fund his authoritarianism? Will the continue to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with its allies to counter Moscow? What we know from history is that wars change things: boundaries, governments, economies and cultures. The Ukraine war may stiffen the spine of the West to advance freedom and prosperity. Alternatively, it may create a black swan-like scenario that fades Ukrainian resiliency and Western help, whereas change favors Putin. At this point, the best advice for the armchair generals, is to avoid staking our policies on which way the war might go and how long – ""years,"" or end next month.",14,4.826656683236122,4.880682729805487,-0.054026046569365604,10

The role-players in this month’s exercise at the National Training Center speak Russian. The enemy force that controls the fictional town of Ujen is using a steady stream of social media posts to make false accusations against the American brigade preparing to attack. In the coming weeks, the planned training scenario for the next brigade coming in will focus on how to battle an enemy willing to destroy a city with rocket and missile fire in order to conquer it. , ' ': . If the images seem familiar, they are, playing out on televisions and websites worldwide right now as Russian forces pound Ukrainian cities with airstrikes, killing scores of civilians. The information war on social media has showcased impassioned nightly speeches by Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, as well as Russian efforts to accuse Ukraine’s forces of faking mass killings in towns such as Bucha – massacres that the West blames on Moscow’s troops. ""I think right now the whole Army is really looking at what’s happening in Ukraine and trying to learn lessons,"" said Army Secretary Christine Wormuth. Those lessons, she said, range from Russia’s equipment and logistics troubles to communications and use of the internet. Soldiers from the 2nd Brigade, 1st Cavalry Division, prepare an attack during an early morning training exercise at the National Training Center at Fort Irwin, California, April 12, 2022. ""The Russia-Ukraine experience is a very powerful illustration for our Army of how important the information domain is going to be,"" said Wormuth, who spent two days at the training center in the Mojave Desert watching an Army brigade wage war against the fictional ""Denovian"" forces. ""We’ve been talking about that for about five years. But really seeing it and seeing the way Zelenskyy has been incredibly powerful. ... This is a world war that the actual world can see and watch in real time. "" ' ': ' At the center, the commander, Brig. Gen. Curt Taylor, and his staff have ripped pages out of the Russian playbook to ensure that U.S. soldiers are ready to fight and win against a sophisticated near-peer enemy. It’s a common tool. For example, his base and the Joint Readiness Training Center in Louisiana both shifted to counterinsurgency training during the Iraq and Afghanistan wars. And the military services have focused other training on how to fight in cold weather – mimicking conditions in Russia or North Korea. But these latest changes have happened quickly in the early months after Russia invaded Ukraine. $800 , About 4,500 soldiers from 2nd Brigade, 1st Cavalry Division, based at Fort Hood, Texas, are out in the vast desert training area at Fort Irwin, where they will spend two weeks fighting the ’s resident 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment, which acts as the enemy military. Soldiers from the regiment – known as Blackhorse – are arrayed in and around Ujen, which also includes role-players acting as the locals. Army Secretary Christine Wormuth, right, talks with Army Col. Ian Palmer, commander of the 2nd Brigade, 1st Cavalry Division, at the National Training Center at Fort Irwin, California, April 12, 2022. As the sun was rising earlier this past week, Army Col. Ian Palmer, the brigade commander, stood on Crash Hill, on the outskirts of the town, preparing his soldiers to launch an attack. Lines of tanks spread out in the distance. Heavy winds the night before hampered his progress, so the attack was a bit behind. He said the exercise is using more drones by the friendly and enemy forces, both for surveillance and attacks. So his forces are trying to use camouflage and tuck into the terrain to stay out of sight. ""You know if you can be seen, you can be shot, wherever you are,"" he said. , Down in the makeshift town, the opposition forces are confident they can hold off Palmer’s brigade despite the size difference. The Denovians only have about 1,350 forces, but they are throwing everything they have at the brigade, from jamming and other electronic warfare to insurgency attacks and propaganda. The role-players have their phones ready to film and post quickly to social media. The Denovian forces want to portray the unit in the worst possible light, said Taylor, and constantly twist the narrative on social media so Palmer’s troops realize they are in a battle for the truth. Army Secretary Christine Wormuth is surrounded by soldiers at the National Training Center at Fort Irwin, California, April 12, 2022. That’s a challenge, he said, because ""when I’ve got a bunch of casualties and I’m getting overrun on my left flank and my supply trains aren’t where they need to be and I can’t find the bulldozers, it’s hard to think about something that someone said about me on Twitter."" The training goal, said Taylor, is teaching how to fuse all elements of combat power into a coordinated assault. ""Everyone can play an instrument, but it’s about making music – bringing it all together in a synchronized fashion. And what you saw today was the artillery was doing the artillery thing, the aviation was doing the aviation thing and the maneuver guys were doing the maneuver thing. But part of the delay in their assault on the town was they couldn’t synchronize those three,"" he said. Again, they can look to Ukraine to see how Russia failed to do that in the early weeks of the war. U.S. leaders repeatedly noted that, in Russia’s initial multipronged assault in Ukraine, commanders consistently failed to provide the airstrikes and support their ground troops needed to move into key cities such as Kyiv. , That failure led to Russian troops bombing the cities from the outskirts, hitting hospitals, apartment buildings and other structures, and killing civilians. So when the next brigade arrives at the training center, Taylor said it will face an enemy on board with doing just that. Brig. Gen. Curt Taylor and Army Secretary Christine Wormuth observe exercises at the National Training Center at Fort Irwin, California, April 12, 2022. ""We will be very focused on how to fight against an adversary that is willing to destroy infrastructure because that’s how we think our adversaries will fight,"" Taylor said. ""We’ve got to be prepared for urban combat where we have an adversary that is indiscriminately firing artillery."" Wormuth, the Army secretary, said seeing the training also underscored other lessons the U.S. is taking from the war in Ukraine. ""As we’re watching what’s happening to the Russians now, it’s informative for us to think about what is right, from a modernization standpoint,"" she said, noting that some U.S. tanks are very heavy and the terrain in Europe is muddier, not like the hard-packed sand of the desert.",14,5.781511702256892,4.613894769044605,1.1676169332122868,10

The jarring number emerged shortly after Russia’s Defense Ministry promised to step up missile attacks on Kyiv in response to Ukraine’s alleged assaults on Russian territory. That ominous warning followed the stunning loss of Moscow's flagship in the Black Sea, which a senior U.S. defense official said Friday was indeed hit by at least one Ukrainian missile. Amid its threats, Moscow continued preparations for a renewed offensive in eastern Ukraine. Fighting also went on in the pummeled southern port city of Mariupol, where locals reported seeing Russian troops digging up bodies. In the northeastern city of Kharkiv, shelling of a residential area killed seven people, including a 7-month-old child, and wounded 34, according to regional Gov. Oleh Sinehubov. : A cat rests inside the grave of Lyudmyla Kononuchenko, 51, who was buried by family and friends after being hit by a rocket on March 23 during the war with Russia, in Irpin, in the outskirts of Kyiv, Ukraine, Friday, April 15, 2022.

He cited police data indicating 95% died from gunshot wounds. ""Consequently, we understand that under the occupation, people were simply executed in the streets,"" Nebytov said. More bodies are being found every day under rubble and in mass graves, he added, with the largest number found in Bucha, where there were more than 350. According to Nebytov, utility workers gathered and buried bodies in the Kyiv suburb while it remained under Russian control. Russian troops, he added, were ""tracking down"" people who expressed strong pro-Ukrainian views.

In his nightly video address to the nation, Zelenskyy also said he discussed the fate of Mariupol with top military and intelligence officials. He said he couldn’t offer details, ""but we are doing everything we can to save our people.’’ Zelenskyy said peace and ""how many more Ukrainians the occupiers have time to kill’’ depend on Ukraine receiving more outside support, and echoed calls for more and faster military aid, as well as an oil embargo on Russia. Armed servicemen of Donetsk People's Republic militia look at a photographer as they carry captured weapons in an area controlled by Russian-backed separatist forces in Mariupol, Ukraine, Friday, April 15, 2022. Mariupol, a strategic port on the Sea of Azov, has been besieged by Russian troops and forces from self-proclaimed separatist areas in eastern Ukraine for more than six weeks. More violence could be in store for Kyiv after Russian authorities accused Ukraine of wounding seven people and damaging about 100 residential buildings with airstrikes in Bryansk, a region bordering Ukraine. Authorities in another border region of Russia also reported Ukrainian shelling Thursday. ""The number and the scale of missile attacks on objects in Kyiv will be ramped up in response to the Kyiv nationalist regime committing any terrorist attacks or diversions on the Russian territory,"" Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov said. Russia used missiles to destroy a facility for the repair and production of missile systems in Kyiv, Konashenkov said. ' ' : Ukrainian officials have not confirmed striking targets in Russia, and the reports could not be independently verified. However, Ukrainian officials said forces did strike a key Russian warship with missiles. A senior U.S. defense official backed up the claim, saying the U.S. now believes the Moskva was hit by at least one Neptune anti-ship missile, and probably two. The official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss an intelligence assessment. The Moskva, named for the Russian capital, sank while being towed to port Thursday after taking heavy damage. Though Moscow did not acknowledge any attack, saying only that a fire had caused ammunition on board to detonate, the loss of the ship represents an important victory for Ukraine and a symbolic defeat for Russia. The sinking reduces Russia’s firepower in the Black Sea, although military analysts disagreed on the event's significance to the course of the war. Either way, the loss was viewed as emblematic of Moscow's fortunes in an eight-week invasion widely seen as a historic blunder following the retreat from the Kyiv region and much of northern Ukraine. ""A ‘flagship’ russian warship is a worthy diving site. We have one more diving spot in the Black Sea now. Will definitely visit the wreck after our victory in the war,"" Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksiy Reznikov tweeted Friday. Russia's warning of renewed airstrikes did not stop Kyiv residents from taking advantage of a sunny and slightly warmer spring Friday as the weekend approached. More people than usual were out on the streets, walking dogs, riding electric scooters, and strolling hand in hand. In one central park, a small group of people including a woman draped in a Ukrainian flag danced to the music of a portable speaker. Such tentative signs of prewar life have resurfaced in the capital after Russian troops failed to capture the city and retreated to concentrate on eastern Ukraine, leaving behind evidence of possible war crimes. But a renewed bombardment could mean a return to the steady wail of air raid sirens heard during the early days of the invasion and to fearful nights sheltering in subway stations. In Mariupol, the city council said Friday that locals reported seeing Russian troops digging up bodies buried in residential courtyards and not allowing new burials ""of people killed by them."" ""Why the exhumation is being carried out and where the bodies will be taken is unknown,"" the council said on the Telegram messaging app. Fighting continued in industrial areas and the port, and Russia for the first time used the Tu-22М3 long-range bomber to attack the city, said Oleksandr Motuzyanyk, a spokesman for the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense. Mariupol has been blockaded by Russian forces since the early days of the invasion, and dwindling numbers of Ukrainian defenders have held out against a siege that has come at a horrific cost to trapped and starving civilians. The mayor said this week that the city's death toll could surpass 20,000. Other Ukrainian officials have said they expect to find evidence in Mariupol of atrocities like the ones discovered in Bucha and other towns outside Kyiv. Mariupol’s capture would allow Russian forces in the south, which came up through the annexed Crimean Peninsula, to fully link up with troops in the Donbas region, Ukraine’s eastern industrial heartland and the target of the looming offensive. It's not certain when Russia will launch a full-scale campaign. Moscow-backed separatists have fought Ukrainian forces in the Donbas since 2014, the same year Russia seized Crimea from Ukraine. Russia has recognized the independence of two rebel-held areas of the region. Also Friday a Russian rocket hit an airport at night in the central city of Oleksandriia, Mayor Serhiy Kuzmenko said via Facebook. He made no mention of casualties.

""When that didn’t work, they’ve moved to Plan D – consolidate in east and a frozen conflict along the border: spin it as a success back home, come back for rest of Ukraine in a few years."" McFarland said the prevailing belief – hers included – prior to the invasion was that Russia would aim to take the Donbas/eastern provinces. She labeled the full invasion a Russian intelligence and military failure, stressing that Russia failed to anticipate the Ukrainian leaders and people. ""Presumably, they thought Ukrainian leaders had been bought and would flee, and Russia could install a puppet government,"" she added. Fredrick Kagan, director of the Critical Threats Project at the American Enterprise Institute, went a step further and said the Donbas region was little more than a ""consolation prize"" to make up for the ""sacrifice"" in Putin’s campaign. ""The overall objective of the invasion was to replace the Zelenskyy government with a government that Moscow could control,"" Kagan said. ""That effort has failed."" Kagan explained that the ""Putin World"" explanation is that Russia has ""bizarrely"" claimed to have achieved its objective around Kyiv and is now working to secure the land claimed by proxy republics Moscow has recognized. : ‘- ,' ‘ ’ But securing those regions could provide a long-term purpose, which is to continue eroding Ukrainian territory and improving future invasion efforts. ""The more Ukrainian territory Russia has the harder it is to keep an independent Ukraine alive over time, and the more opportunities Putin will have to invade again after he’s built up his military or to do other things to achieve his aim to bring down an independent Ukrainian government,"" Kagan argued. The extreme losses in Ukraine have pushed Russia to ""frantically"" rush to build up the military again, with a more robust conscription effort and other short-cut methods that will allow them to field something of an army. Ultimately, Kagan believes that as long as Putin or ""Putinism"" remains dominant in Russia, it will continue seeking to destroy an independent Ukraine. ""This was never about Donbas, and it’s also never been about , primarily,"" Kagan said. ""[Putin] does not accept Ukraine has the right to an independent government, he does not accept Ukraine’s sovereignty and he does not accept its existence as an independent state.""",14,4.061373735291549,4.734139607770207,-0.6727658724786583,11

Mikhail Mizintsev, Head of Interagency Coordination Headquarters for Humanitarian Response, accused the United States and France of engaging in the activities, according to reporting from Russia state-owned media. Mizintsev said that the foreign operatives are attempting to spread disinformation about Russia and lay the groundwork to accuse its forces of war crimes. 10,000 Russian President Vladimir Putin But Rebekah Koffler, author of ""Putin's Playbook"" and former intelligence officer focused on Russia, believes the declaration by Mizintsev is an attempt by Russia to launch its own disinformation campaign as a way to cover for potential crimes committed in Ukraine. ""This statement is almost certainly Russia’s own disinformation campaign intended to hide Russia’s hand in the atrocities that have been, are being and will be conducted in the coming weeks by the Russian forces in Ukraine,"" Koffler said. ""The goal is to blame Ukraine in order to confuse Western audience about who exactly commits brutality in Ukraine.""

He went on to say that these specialists would then be conducting investigations into alleged war crimes committed by Russia, which were likely to be biased against Russia. President Biden But Koffler believes that Mizintsev's statement is a Russian attempt to cause confusion ahead of its offensive, with intelligence indicating that its forces are likely to more heavily target civilians in the coming weeks. ""Intelligence indicates that Russia will escalate the level of atrocities, targeting civilians and employing scorched earth tactics in the next 3-4 weeks as Putin is rushing to wrap up the active combat phase of operations in Ukraine,"" Koffler said. ""Given Putin’s recent appointment of Gen. Aleksandr Dvornikov to take over command Russian forces, use of chemical weapons cannot be ruled out."" Koffler noted that Russia runs ""disinformation operations"" and ""strategic deception"" hand-in-hand with its military operations, which in this case will be used in an attempt to discredit Western claims of Russian war crimes.

Zelenskyy, who previously said more than 300 people were tortured and killed in Bucha alone, spelled out Tuesday how ""civilians were crushed by tanks while sitting in their cars in the middle of the road,"" ""women were raped and killed in front of their children,"" and equated Russian aggressors to ""terrorists"" occupying other territories for cutting out the tongues of Ukrainian civilians who opposed them. On Monday, Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said the mayor of Motyzhyn, a village outside of Kyiv, Olga Sukhenko, was killed by Russian captors alongside her husband and son. Their bodies were reportedly found in a shallow grave in a forest near homes used as makeshift Russian barracks. Vereshchuk said 11 other Ukrainian mayors and community heads are in Russian captivity. Ukrainian Lesia Vasylenko on Tuesday highlighted how the United Nations declared that Ukraine is the most mine-infested country in the world as over a million people live around land rigged with explosives. Reports said Russian soldiers had rigged at least some of the bodies of Ukrainian civilians they killed with explosives to evoke more tragedy as people recover the dead from shallow graves. Thomas-Greenfield, who returned Monday from a trip visiting Ukrainian refugees in Moldova and Romania, shared three stories of the more than 10 million people – six million who’ve been internally displaced, and four million who’ve fled Ukraine – during the conflict spanning for over 40 days. The ambassador shared the story of one young woman who fled with her 6-year-old brother who has autism and is sick with cancer, remarking how ""Russia's war has interrupted the care her brother desperately needs."" Another woman, Thomas-Greenfield said, fled with her 8-year-old child from Odessa, leaving behind the child’s father, who told them shelling later struck next to their apartment. A third woman told the ambassador she loved to travel but never thought her next trip would be to ""flee for her life,"" breaking down in tears as she wondered if she would be able to return home to Kyiv. The U.S. recently announced another $1 billion in new funding toward humanitarian assistance as neighboring countries, including Moldova, Romania, Poland, Slovakia and Hungary, ""are bearing the brunt of Europe’s most significant refugee crisis since the Second World War,"" the ambassador said. The U.S. has committed to taking in up to 100,000 Ukrainian refugees and others displaced by Russia’s war.",13,2.6027629674268544,2.4443079690891794,0.15845499833767507,20

Ukrainian officials and at least the leaders of Poland and Spain have gone a step further to say Russians committed genocide during what's been deemed the Bucha massacre, as shocking images have surfaced of civilians with their hands tied behind their backs shot and killed at close range and bodies of women and children showing signs of rape and torture. : ""We knew Putin’s invasion plans included summary executions by his military and intelligence services,"" 6 Chief Richard Moore tweeted on Sunday. ""The reports of execution-style killings of civilians emerging from liberated areas are horrifying and chilling."" Ukrainian officials said the bodies of 410 civilians were found in towns around the capital, Kyiv. In Bucha, northwest of the capital, Associated Press journalists said they witnessed 21 bodies. One group of nine, all in civilian clothes, were scattered around a site that residents said Russian troops used as a base. They appeared to have been shot at close range. At least two had their hands tied behind their backs. In Motyzhyn, to the west of Kyiv, journalists also said they saw the bodies of four people who appeared to have been shot at close range and thrown into a pit. Residents said the mayor, her son and her husband — who had been bound and blindfolded — were among them. : : A dog lays next to the body of a civilian in Bucha, Ukraine on Sunday. : Soldiers walk amid destroyed Russian tanks in Bucha, on the outskirts of Kyiv, Ukraine, on Sunday.

""I want every mother of every Russian soldier to see the bodies of the killed people in Bucha, in Irpin, in Hostomel. What did they do? Why were they killed?"" Zelenskyy said.

Despite normally erring on the side of secrecy, top-ranking intelligence officials in the U.S., U.K. and other Western countries have been more outspoken about the war in Ukraine as part of an effort to counteract what they categorize as Russian misinformation seeking to displace blame for Putin’s invasion. Last week, Sir Jeremy Fleming, director of , the 's Intelligence, Cyber and Security Agency, described Putin’s ""personal war"" in Ukraine as a ""strategic miscalculation."" ""Even though we believe Putin's advisers are afraid to tell him the truth, what's going on and the extent of these misjudgments must be crystal clear to the regime,"" he told an audience in Australia, according to Business Insider. Truss said the United Kingdom will fully support any investigations by the International Criminal Court, in its role as the primary institution with the mandate to investigate and prosecute war crimes. The -led effort to expedite and support an International Criminal Court investigation into crimes in Ukraine was the largest State referral in its history, according to the foreign secretary. ""We will not rest until those responsible for atrocities, including military commanders and individuals in the Putin regime, have faced justice,"" she said Sunday. ""At this time, more than ever, it is essential that the international community continues to provide Ukraine with the humanitarian and military support it so dearly needs, and that we step up sanctions to cut off funding for Putin’s war machine at source."" Truss is expected to travel to Warsaw, Poland to meet her Ukrainian counterpart, Dmytro Kuleba, Monday evening and her Polish counterpart, Zbigniew Rau, Tuesday.

The former United Nations chief prosecutor who oversaw investigations of war crimes in Rwanda and Yugoslavia has called for an international arrest warrant for Russian President Vladimir Putin. In an interview published Saturday for the Swiss newspaper Le Temps, Carla Del Ponte, decried the Russian autocrat as a ""war criminal"" for orchestrating Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

Other war crimes she identified in Ukraine included attacks on civilians, the destruction of civilian buildings and even the demolishing of entire villages. : ‘ ’ She said the investigation in Ukraine would be easier than that in Yugoslavia because the country itself had requested an international probe.

Russian President Vladimir Putin spoke to female flight attendants in comments broadcast on state television on Saturday, March 5, 2022. Del Ponte said it would be possible to bring even Putin to account, pointing to the investigation of Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic while he was still in office. Milosevic was arrested in the early 2000s on charges of war crimes after orchestrating a brutal campaign of ethnic cleaning against non-Serbs during the breakup and collapse of Yugoslavia. He died in his prison cell while awaiting trial in The Hague. ""Who would have thought then that he would one day be judged? Nobody,"" she told Blick.

Associated Press journalists in Bucha, a small city northwest of Kyiv, saw the bodies of at least nine people in civilian clothes who appeared to have been killed at close range. At least two had their hands tied behind their backs. The also saw two bodies wrapped in plastic, bound with tape and thrown into a ditch. Authorities said they were documenting evidence as Ukraine’s military reclaims territory and discovers indications of execution-style slayings to add to their case for prosecuting Russian officials for war crimes. - ' ': Oleksiy Arestovych, an adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said scores of killed civilians were found on the streets of Bucha and the Kyiv suburbs of Irpin and Hostomel in what looked like a ""scene from a horror movie."" Arestovych said some people were shot in the head and had their hands bound, and some bodies showed signs of torture, rape and burning. The capital city’s mayor, Vitali Klitschko, said civilians were ""shot with joined hands"" and told German newspaper Bild that ""what happened in Bucha and other suburbs of Kyiv can only be described as genocide."" Ukrainian servicemen climb on a fighting vehicle outside Kyiv, Ukraine, Saturday, April 2, 2022. A day earlier, journalists witnessed Ukrainian soldiers gingerly removing at least six bodies from a street in Bucha with cables in case the Russians had booby-trapped corpses with explosives before their withdrawal. Local residents said the dead people were civilians killed without provocation, a claim that could not be independently verified. Klitschko called on other nations to immediately end Russian gas imports, saying they were funding the invasion of Ukraine, now in its 39th day. ""Not a penny should go to Russia anymore. That’s bloody money used to slaughter people. The gas and oil embargo must come immediately,"" the mayor said. - Charles Michel, president of the European Council, wrote on Twitter that he was shocked by the ""haunting images of atrocities committed by Russian army"" in the capital region. The and non-governmental organizations were assisting in the effort to preserve evidence of war crimes, according to Michel, who promised ""further sanctions"" against Russia. On Sunday morning, Russian forces launched an airstrike on the Black Sea port of Odesa, in southern Ukraine, sending up clouds of dark smoke that veiled parts of the city. The Russian military said the targets were an oil processing plant and fuel depots around Odesa, which is Ukraine’s largest port and home to its navy. ""I live in that eight-floor building. At 6 in the morning, Russia launched an attack, and this piece of rock reached my house,"" said Maiesienko Ilia, who lives near one of the targeted facilities. People watch as smoke rises after shelling in Odesa, Ukraine, Sunday, April 3, 2022. The Odesa city council said Ukraine’s air defense shot down some missiles before they hit the city. Ukrainian military spokesman Vladyslav Nazarov said there were no casualties from the attack. The smaller port of Mariupol, located to the east on the Sea of Azov, remained cut off from the rest of the country as Russian and Ukrainian soldiers fought for control of the besieged city. About 100,000 civilians – less than a quarter of the prewar population of 430,000 – are believed to be trapped there with little or no food, water, fuel and medicine, The International Committee of the Red Cross said it hoped a team of nine staffers and three vehicles it sent Saturday to help evacuate residents would reach Mariupol on Sunday but cautioned, ""The situation on the ground is volatile and subject to rapid changes."" Ukrainian authorities said Russia agreed days ago to allow safe passage from the city, which has been the site of some of the worst attacks and greatest suffering, but similar agreements have broken down repeatedly under continued shelling. Mariupol is in the mostly Russian-speaking Donbas region, where Moscow-backed separatists have fought Ukrainian troops for eight years. Its capture would create an unbroken land corridor from Russia to Crimea, which Moscow seized from Ukraine in 2014. With Mariupol squarely in Russia’s crosshairs, Ukraine insisted it had gained a leg up elsewhere in the country. As his country’s troops retook territory north of the capital of Kyiv from departing Russian troops, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called on all Ukrainians to do whatever they could ""to foil the enemy’s tactics and weaken its capabilities."" Women stay next to a car as smoke rises in the background after shelling in Odesa, Ukraine, Sunday, April 3, 2022. ""Peace will not be the result of any decisions the enemy makes somewhere in Moscow. There is no need to entertain empty hopes that they will simply leave our land. We can only have peace by fighting,"" Zelenskyy said late Saturday. Zelenskyy and Ukraine’s Western allies believe Russia has shifted its forces from the capital region and the country’s north in order to build strength in the east and south. The Ukrainian leader again urged the West to supply his military with warplanes and more anti-missile systems. ""Every Russian missile that hits our cities and every bomb dropped on our people, on our children, only adds black paint to the history that will describe everyone on whom the decision depended – the decision of whether to help Ukraine with modern weapons,"" Zelenskyy said. 'S ' ' While the geography of the battlefield morphed, little changed for many Ukrainians more than five weeks into a war that has sent more than 4 million people fleeing the country as refugees and displaced millions more from their homes. The regional governor in Kharkiv, said Sunday that Russian artillery and tanks performed over 20 strikes on Ukraine’s second-largest city and its outskirts in the country’s northeast over the past day. Gov. Oleh Synyehubov said a missile strike on the city of Lozovo wounded four people and that Russian tanks bombarded a hospital in the town of Balakliia. Zelenskyy alleged Saturday that Russian troops have left mines around homes, abandoned equipment and even the bodies of the dead as they withdraw from around Kyiv. Those claims could not be independently verified, but Ukrainian troops were seen heeding the warning.

Ukraine and Western allies have reported mounting evidence of Russia withdrawing its forces from around Kyiv and sending troops to eastern Ukraine. Officials said Ukraine's fighters had reclaimed several areas near its capital city, including the city of Brovary. However, the shift does not mean the country faces a reprieve from the war. The New York Times reported Saturday that Russian forces moved to crack down on protesters in the southeastern of city Enerhodar, which is home to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant.

""As protesters began to disperse, the invaders arrived in police vehicles, and began to force local residents into them,"" the post read. ""A few minutes later, the city was rocked by massive explosions and shelling."" The agency said four people were injured and received medical assistance. Energoatom also claimed that Russian forces jammed phone and internet communications throughout Enerhodar, although the agency’s claims could not be immediately verified. At least three Russian ballistic missiles were fired late Friday at the Odesa region – though the Ukrainian military said the Iskander missiles did not hit the critical infrastructure they targeted. Zelenskyy said he expected towns to receive airstrikes and shelling from afar and for eastern fighting to be intense. In Mariupol, a southern port city located in the mostly Russian-speaking Donbas region, the International Committee of the Red Cross planned Saturday to get emergency supplies into the besieged city and evacuate residents.

As of March 17, Russian forces have lost over 230 of their heavily armored tracked vehicles, according to the Wall Street Journal. Ukraine's government believes the amount of equipment lost by Russian forces is much higher and estimates that more than 400 Russian tanks have been destroyed, according to the report.

Jack Keane on how the Russian military is moving forward in Ukraine after setbacks. Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich and at least two senior Ukrainian peacekeepers suffered symptoms from a suspected poisoning attack but have since recovered, according to a report published Monday. Following a meeting in the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv earlier this month, Abramovich and the two senior members of the Ukrainian peacekeeping team, including Crimean Tatar lawmaker Rustem Umerov and a second unnamed individual, began experiencing symptoms that included red eyes, constant and painful tearing, and peeling skin on their faces and hands, The Wall Street Journal reported. Citing unnamed sources familiar with the incident, the newspaper said it’s not clear who was responsible for the alleged attack, but the victims pointed to hardliners in Moscow trying to sabotage talks to end the war. Abramovich, Umerov and the third officials have since improved in condition and their lives are not in danger following the suspected poisoning, the sources said.

The sources added that Western experts said it was difficult to determine whether the symptoms were caused by a chemical or biological agent or by some sort of electromagnetic-radiation attack. It wouldn’t be the first time the Kremlin has been blamed for such an attack. Christo Grozev, a member of the open-source collective Bellingcat, which determined that the Kremlin was behind a nerve agent attack on Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny in 2020, told the Journal that the suspected attack on Abramovich and Ukrainian negotiators ""was not intended to kill,"" describing the suspected poisoning incident as ""just a warning.""

The yacht left a Barcelona port earlier this week as the government sanctioned Abramovich, a Russian billionaire who owns the Chelsea football club, in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. ) Grozev said he’s seen photos of the effects of the suspected poisoning, but a timely sample collection could not be organized in the western Ukrainian city of Lviv because the officials were in a hurry to travel to Istanbul, Turkey for additional talks between Ukrainian and Russian officials this week. Too much time had passed for the suspected poison to be detected before a German-based forensic team with the required expertise could arrive to perform an examination, he added. When contacted by Fox News, Mykhailo Podoliak, an adviser for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, denied information about the suspected poisoning. A source at the Ukrainian Defense Ministry also told Fox News that The Journal’s article was the first time they heard about the poisoning and ""Minister Reznikov feels good and is working."" ""All members of the negotiating team are working normally today,"" Podoliak also said Monday in reaction to the report about the suspected poisoning of Abramovich and Ukrainian negotiators, according to Ukrainian media outlet, Novoye Vremya. ""In the information field there are now many information speculations, various conspiracy theories and elements of one or another information game. Therefore, I will repeat once again - members of negotiating groups work today in regular modes."" In 2018, U.K. officials blamed the Russian intelligence services for a nerve agent attack against defected former Russian military officer Sergei Skripal and his daughter, Yulia. They both survived, as did a British police officer hospitalized after exposure to the nerve agent. But a British woman accidentally exposed to the poison later died. The Kremlin denied any involvement in the incident. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy reportedly asked President Biden not to impose sanctions against Abramovich because he is involved in ongoing negotiations, shuttling between Moscow and Kyiv, Lyiv, Poland, Belarus and other locations for in-person talks since Russian President Vladimir Putin launched the invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24. Abramovich, who owns Chelsea soccer club, a minority stake in the steel company Evraz and has Portuguese citizenship, has been sanctioned by the U.K. and the European Union. During an interview with Russian journalists this weekend, which has since reportedly been barred from airing on Russian state-run stations, Zelenskyy said Abramovich was an initial member of a subcommittee of the Russian negotiating team who later became involved in humanitarian issues, such as civilian evacuations from the port city Mariupol, which has suffered heavy Russian bombardment.

""Now, it’s all up to all of us to stop Putin while it’s still local in Ukraine because this war is not only about Ukraine,"" she said, but ""an attack on democracy."" Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, now in its 32nd day, has stalled in many areas. Its aim to quickly encircle the capital, Kyiv, and force its surrender has faltered against staunch Ukrainian resistance — bolstered by weapons from the U.S. and other Western allies. Zelenskyy signed a law Sunday that bans reporting on troop and equipment movements that haven’t been announced or approved by the military. Journalists who violate the law could face three to eight years in prison. The law does not differentiate between Ukrainian and foreign reporters. President Joe Biden Britain’s Defense Ministry said Russia’s troops are trying to encircle Ukrainian forces facing the two separatist-held areas in the country’s east. That would cut the bulk of Ukraine’s military off from the rest of the country. Moscow claims its focus is on wresting the entire eastern Donbas region, which has been partially controlled by Russia-backed separatists since 2014. A high-ranking Russian military official said Friday that troops were being redirected to the east from other parts of the country. The leader of one separatist-controlled area of Donbas said Sunday that he wants to hold a vote on joining Russia, words that may indicate a shift in Russia’s position. Leonid Pasechnik, the head of the self-proclaimed Luhansk People’s Republic, said it plans to hold a referendum on becoming part of Russia ""in the nearest time."" Russia has supported the separatist rebels in Luhansk and neighboring Donetsk since an insurgency erupted there shortly after Moscow annexed the Crimean Peninsula from Ukraine in 2014. In talks with Ukraine, Moscow has demanded Kyiv acknowledge the independence of Donetsk and Luhansk. Kyrylo Budanov, the head of Ukrainian military intelligence, accused Russia of seeking to split Ukraine in two, like North and South Korea. ""The occupiers will try to pull the occupied territories into a single quasi-state structure and pit it against independent Ukraine,"" Budanov said in a statement released by the Defense Ministry. He predicted that guerrilla warfare by Ukrainians would derail such plans. A Ukrainian delegate in talks with Russia on ending the war, Davyd Arakhamia, said in a Facebook post the countries would meet in Turkey beginning Monday. However, the Russians then announced the talks would start Tuesday. The sides have met previously with no deal reached. Ukraine says that to defeat Russia, the West must provide fighter jets and not just missiles and other military equipment. A proposal to transfer Polish planes to Ukraine via the United States was scrapped amid concerns about being drawn into direct fighting. In his pointed remarks, Zelenskyy accused Western governments of being ""afraid to prevent this tragedy. Afraid to simply make a decision."" ""So, who is in charge of the Euro-Atlantic community? Is it still Moscow, thanks to its scare tactics?"" he asked. ""Our partners must step up their aid to Ukraine."" His plea was echoed Sunday by a priest in the western city of Lviv, which was struck by rockets a day earlier. The aerial assault illustrated that Moscow, despite assertions that it intends to shift the war eastward, is willing to strike anywhere in Ukraine.

Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov confirmed Russia used air-launched cruise missiles to hit a fuel depot and a defense plant in Lyiv, about 45 miles from the Polish border. He said another strike with sea-launched missiles destroyed a depot in Plesetske just west of Kyiv, where Ukraine stored air defense missiles. A chemical smell lingered in Lyiv on Sunday as firefighters trained hoses on flames and black smoke poured from oil storage tanks hit in the attack. A security guard, Yaroslav Prokopiv, said he saw three rockets destroy two oil tanks but no one was hurt. Russia’s back-to-back airstrikes shook the city that has become a haven for an estimated 200,000 people who have fled bombarded towns and cities. Lviv, which has largely been spared bombardment, also has been a waystation for most of the 3.8 million refugees who have left Ukraine since Russia invaded on Feb. 24. In a dim, crowded bomb shelter under an apartment block near the first blast site, Olana Ukrainets, a 34-year-old information technology professional, said she couldn’t believe she had to hide again after fleeing from the northeastern city of Kharkiv, one of the most bombarded cities. ""We were on one side of the street and saw it on the other side,"" she said. ""We saw fire. I said to my friend, ‘What’s this?’ Then we heard the sound of an explosion and glass breaking."" In his video address, Zelenskyy angrily warned Moscow that it was sowing a deep hatred for Russia among Ukrainians. ""You are doing everything so that our people themselves leave the Russian language, because the Russian language will now be associated only with you, with your explosions and murders, your crimes,"" Zelenskyy said. Along with the millions of people who have fled Ukraine, the invasion has driven more than 10 million people from their homes, almost one-quarter of Ukraine’s population. Thousands of civilians are believed to have been killed. While Russia’s advance on Kyiv remains stalled, fighting has raged in the suburbs, and blasts from missiles fired into the city have rattled the St. Sophia Cathedral, a 1,000-year-old world heritage site that is the heart of Ukrainian spiritual and national identity.

President Biden said this week that Russia is ""exploring options"" to target the U.S. and its allies through cyberattacks as tensions with Moscow remain precarious. ""The more Putin’s back is against the wall, the greater the severity of the tactics he may employ,"" the president said Monday. ""One of the tools he’s most likely to use in my view, in our view, is cyberattacks."" ""The magnitude of Russia’s cyber capacity is fairly consequential and it’s coming,"" he added. : Russian President Vladimir Putin attends a meeting of the Supreme Eurasian Economic Council in Yerevan, Armenia. Under the 1949 North Atlantic Treaty, also known as the Washington Treaty, an attack on one member of the 30-nation alliance will be viewed as attack on all allied nations – a concept that applies to cyberwarfare. But Biden’s national security adviser Jake Sullivan said this week that while a Russia-based cyberattack could prompt a -wide reaction, it does not necessarily mean a military response will be activated. ""Any cyberattack that results in death or injury or damage is going to be a pretty important thing to which must respond,"" former Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Europe and Michael Ryan told Fox News Digital.

""One: on a civilian target that causes physical damage or, more importantly, causes loss of life or injury to citizens,"" he said. ""The other type of cyberattack that could necessitate a response is one that's purely military – targeting military capabilities."" Ryan said that while targeting military capabilities may be considered provocative and could be seen as a precursor to an invasion, it doesn’t necessarily mean that all nations would in fact respond. The charter permits each nation to individually decide whether it will take action following an assault on an allied partner. Though the language of the treaty legally allows a militaristic response, including in the cyber domain, it does not require any nation to respond with military force.

The warned this week that Russia could be looking to hit U.S. infrastructure – a scenario that experts have routinely warned against. But Ryan argued the bigger threat to security is Russia’s continued use of disinformation to cause public discord.

His return to Moscow in the late 1990s led to rapid promotion, culminating in a post in 2003 as the head of operations directorate of the chief of staff, a role that tasked him with military planning duties.

A Green Berets U.S. Army Special Forces Group soldier in action - Green Berets are required to learn a foreign language as part of their training and are constantly trained in the political, economic and cultural complexities of the regions in which they are assigned to operate. This unique skill set allows them to partner with foreign forces for training and at times to fight alongside them. Those skills have been put to use in Ukraine since 2014, with Green Berets and members of the Army's National Guard advising and training Ukrainian forces at Yavoriv Combat Training Center in western Ukraine. It's the same facility Russia attacked with rockets on March 13, killing 35. The Americans had already left, vacating the facility and moving troops deployed there to Germany in February. Part of the job Green Berets did at Yavoriv was to train their Ukrainian counterparts to set up militia units that could wage guerrilla warfare against an invading force. The Ukrainian military can now put those lessons to use, with the government actively encouraging its citizens to join the fight against Russian forces. Civilians practice moving in groups at a military training exercise. But the work Green Berets are doing in Europe hasn't stopped, with forces still stationed in Europe helping prepare partner countries for the possibility of a Russian invasion farther into Europe. Such a move would be a mistake for Russia, Moore told Fox News Digital, arguing that the invasion of Ukraine has already gone poorly in part because of U.S. assistance, and a further move into territory would go even worse.

John Katko, that he would be ""very surprised"" if Russia does not carry out a cyber attack against the United States, warning that the Biden administration is ""not doing anything"" to prevent attacks. Biden, on Monday, warned that U.S. officials have collected ""evolving intelligence"" to suggest that the Russian government is exploring options for potential cyberattacks against the United States amid its multi-front war against Ukraine. : Katko, R-N.Y., on the sidelines of the House Republican Issues Conference, said it is ""good"" that Biden is warning Americans, noting that a cyberattack from Russia could be ""quite severe."" ""Assume there is a heightened chance of that happening, given Russia has got their backs against the wall and things aren’t going well in Ukraine,"" Katko told Fox News. ""Assume that that is probably going to happen, and act accordingly."" Last month, the Department of Homeland Security warned U.S. organizations at all levels that they could face cyber threats stemming from the Russia-Ukraine conflict. - 31: Rep. John Katko, R-N.Y., leaves the Capitol after the House vote on an impeachment inquiry resolution on Thursday, October 31, 2019. ) The Biden administration has worked to strengthen cyber defenses after a string of ransomware attacks last summer, with foreign malign actors targeting pieces of U.S. critical infrastructure. In June 2021, a ransomware assault shut down the U.S.-based meat plants of the world’s largest meatpacker, Brazil-based . The White House said the hack was likely carried out by a criminal group based in Russia. The attack on came just weeks after the largest U.S. fuel pipeline, the East Coast's Colonial Pipeline, was targeted by a criminal group originating in Russia. Biden, during his summit in Geneva with Russian President Vladimir Putin in June 2021, raised the issue of ransomware. Biden, at the time, said he told Putin that ""certain critical infrastructure should be off limits to attack."" Biden said he gave a list of ""16 specific entities defined as critical infrastructure,"" saying it ranged from energy to water systems. Putin, though, during his press conference after the meeting, denied that Russia was responsible for cyberattacks and instead claimed that most cyberattacks in the world were carried out from the U.S. But Katko slammed Biden for his strategy. ""I wanted to scream,"" Katko told Fox News. ""Everything is off limits—they shouldn’t be doing it at all, and if they are doing it, we should be fighting back hard."" ""The problem is this administration has not gone back against Russia, has not gone back against China, has not gone back against Iran,"" Katko continued. ""We’re not doing anything about it and the bad guys are getting emboldened."" Katko told Fox News that the ""biggest thing"" Congress can do is ensure that the Cybersecurity Infrastructure Security Agency is given ""the tools it needs."" ' ' ""It needs more funding and support, but they’re doing a great job already,"" Katko said. ""They do not need to be a regulatory agency, they need to be a partner with the private sector to keep the system secure, and if they continue to do that, that would be great."" Katko added that ""the more resources"" Congress can give , ""the better our country is going to be from a cyber standpoint."" On whether Russia will carry out a cyberattack against the United States, Katko replied: ""I’d be very surprised if they don’t.""

Biden, this week, said this is ""a critical moment to accelerate our work to improve domestic cybersecurity and bolster our national resilience."" The Biden administration has been warning about the potential for ""malicious cyber activity"" against the United States by the Russian government—which Biden said could be a response to the ""unprecedented economic costs we’ve imposed on Russia alongside our allies and partners. It’s part of Russia's playbook."" President Biden hasn't done enough to deter a Russian cyberattack, according to a top House Republican. ""Today, my Administration is reiterating those warnings based on evolving intelligence that the Russian Government is exploring options for potential cyberattacks,"" Biden said Monday. The Biden administration has been working to ""strengthen"" national cyber defenses, and has mandated ""extensive cybersecurity measures for the Federal Government and those critical infrastructure sectors where we have authority to do so."" The president on Monday also stressed that the administration has created ""public-private partnerships and initiatives to enhance cybersecurity across all our critical infrastructure."" ""Congress has partnered with us on these efforts — we appreciate that Members of Congress worked across the aisle to require companies to report cyber incidents to the United States Government,"" Biden said. ""My Administration will continue to use every tool to deter, disrupt, and if necessary, respond to cyberattacks against critical infrastructure,"" the president said Monday, but said the ""Federal Government can’t defend against this threat alone."" : ""Most of America’s critical infrastructure is owned and operated by the private sector and critical infrastructure owners and operators must accelerate efforts to lock their digital doors,"" Biden said. "" The Department of Homeland Security’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency has been actively working with organizations across critical infrastructure to rapidly share information and mitigation guidance to help protect their systems and networks."" The president urged private sector partners to ""harden your cyber defenses immediately by implementing the best practices we have developed together over the last year.""

""We need everyone to do their part to meet one of the defining threats of our time — your vigilance and urgency today can prevent or mitigate attacks tomorrow."" Biden in July signed a national security memorandum directing his administration to develop cybersecurity performance goals for critical infrastructure in the U.S. – entities like electricity utility companies, chemical plants and nuclear reactors.

2022-03-24,Fox,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/next-phase-russia-ukraine-war-4-things-chuck-devore,Russia-Ukraine war's next phase – 4 things to watch,"John Herbst expresses offense at American reluctance to provide MiGs to Ukraine on 'Your World.' Russia’s first military campaign against Ukraine has culminated without reaching its objectives: the overthrow of the government of Volodymyr Zelenskyy and the installation of a pro-Moscow puppet regime. Incapable of defeating the Ukrainian military, Russia now seeks to destroy Ukrainian cities, killing as many civilians as possible to force a surrender. It won’t happen, as each barrage steels Ukrainian resolve to resist. A member of Ukraine's Territorial Defense Forces during training. As Russia’s war on Ukraine enters a new phase, here are four things to watch. 'S - Ukraine’s army Ukraine has 7 million people fit for military service and is seeking to mobilize them for the defense of the nation. Ukraine can draft more military personnel than can Russia, as Ukraine is in an existential fight and has virtually unlimited financial backing from the and America. By mid-April, hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians will have received enough training to competently serve as infantry, allowing Ukraine to replace losses and increase the size of many units. This will give Ukraine the option to increase counterattacks – if it has tolerance for the higher losses that might entail. Russia’s options Until the fields dry out in late May or early June, allowing for rapid cross-country mobility, Russia will only have one viable option: to pound Ukrainian cities with artillery. To do so, Russia needs to secure supply lines to within 10 to 20 miles from city centers – the range of its rocket launchers and artillery. And it needs to protect them from increasingly effective Ukrainian drones. Russia has a bigger challenge with mounting something more than harassing bombardment against Ukraine. The abysmal state of their maintenance practices has stripped them of the trucks needed to ship the thousands of tons of artillery ammunition to the front. Belarus Belarus recalled its ambassador from Ukraine a few days ago and is making noises that it might send troops to help Russia. There are three problems with that. First, the Belarussian army isn’t very good—its main job is to cow its own citizens into not overthrowing Belarussian strongman president Alexander Lukashenko. Second, the border between Belarus and Ukraine is defined by the extensive Pripyat Marsh, one of the world's largest, making military movement south difficult. Third, if Lukashenko does commit a significant portion of his army against Ukraine, he risks domestic unrest that threatens his own regime – and by extension, Russian President Vladimir Putin. That risk outweighs any gains that would be expected on the battlefield. China Putin has asked China for help. The areas in which Russia has the greatest need are precision-guided munition resupply and new trucks. America and its allies need to make it very clear to China that seeing equipment of Chinese manufacture in Ukraine will trigger significant sanctions on the Chinese economy. The West cannot afford to allow Beijing to bail Moscow out of its Kyiv quagmire. The last thing the free world needs is an ascendant alliance of dictatorial states.",14,4.42339560578234,4.288252706438458,0.13514289934388213,10

The global nongovernmental organization Mercy Corps said Tuesday that one of the largest areas of concern in Ukraine is the vulnerability of the supply chain. Most municipalities that have seen some of the heaviest fighting only have between three and four days of food as ""the humanitarian system is entirely broken down,"" Mercy Corps’ Ukraine humanitarian response adviser, Steve Gordon, told . While the U.N. has been able to get aid to some areas, humanitarian corridors have been largely blocked and compared to what’s normally a ""high-functioning, coordinated international aid effort"" in other conflict zones, many people in Ukraine are only surviving due to small Ukrainian civil society organizations, including church volunteers, who are coordinating deliveries of food and medical supplies, he said. Russian President Vladimir Putin’s forces are increasingly concentrating their air power and artillery on Ukraine’s cities and the civilians living there. Moscow’s invasion has driven nearly 3.5 million people from Ukraine, according to the U.N., with another 6.5 million displaced inside the country. U.S. and British officials say Kyiv remains Russia’s primary objective. The bulk of Moscow’s forces remain miles from the city center, but missiles and artillery have destroyed apartment buildings and a large shopping mall, which was left a smoking ruin after being hit late Sunday by strikes that killed eight people, according to emergency officials. 'S The said it believes that the actual figures for civilian casualties are considerably higher, especially in territory still controlled by the Ukrainian government and especially in recent days.

In areas like Sumy, there are about 800,000 people ""nearly entirely reliant"" on aid shipped in on a day-to-day basis, Gordon said. In Mariupol, with communications crippled, movement restricted and many residents in hiding, the fate of those inside an art school flattened on Sunday and a theater that was blown apart four days earlier was unclear.

Ukraine’s Defense Ministry said Tuesday that their forces were still defending the city and had destroyed a Russian patrol boat and electronic warfare complex. Over the weekend, Moscow had offered safe passage out of Mariupol — one corridor leading east to Russia, another going west to other parts of Ukraine — in return for the city’s surrender before daybreak Monday. Ukraine flatly rejected the offer well before the deadline. Mariupol had a prewar population of about 430,000. Around a quarter were believed to have left in the opening days of the war, and tens of thousands escaped over the past week by way of the humanitarian corridors. Other attempts have been thwarted by the fighting. Mariupol's officials said on March 15 that at least 2,300 people had died in the siege, with some buried in mass graves. There has been no official estimate since then, but the number is feared to be far higher after six more days of bombardment. Zelenskyy’s count of dead children was two more than the 115 total recorded by the Prosecutor General’s Office of Ukraine as of 8 a.m. local time Monday. At least 148 more children had been injured by then, according to the prosecutor’s office.

The report was quickly removed, and newspaper blamed hackers. The Kremlin refused to comment on Tuesday. Beyond the terrible human toll, the war has shaken the post-Cold War global security consensus, imperiled the global supply of key crops including wheat, and repeatedly raised worries it could set off a nuclear accident. Ukraine’s natural resources minister said wildfires near the Chernobyl nuclear power plant have been extinguished and radiation levels in the area are within norms. Fires are not uncommon in the area, but raise concern about the potential release of radiation from fallout from the 1986 explosion and fire at the plant. Concerns have been expressed for safety at the decommissioned plant since it was seized by Russian forces last month. The power supply was temporarily cut amid fighting earlier this month, and Ukraine’s nuclear regulatory agency said Monday that radiation monitors around the plant had stopped working. Facing unexpectedly stiff resistance, Russian President Vladimir Putin’s forces are increasingly concentrating their air power and artillery on Ukraine’s cities and the civilians living there. A senior U.S. defense official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the military’s assessment, said Russia had increased its air sorties, carrying out as many as 300 over a 24-hour period. U.S. and British officials say Kyiv remains Russia’s primary objective. The bulk of Moscow’s forces remain miles from the center, but missiles and artillery have destroyed apartment buildings and a large shopping mall, which was left a smoking ruin after being hit late Sunday by strikes that killed eight people, according to emergency officials. ‘,’ 'S ‘ ’ U.S. President Joe Biden, who is heading to Europe later in the week to meet with allies, suggested Monday evening that worse may be still to come. ""Putin’s back is against the wall,"" Biden said. ""He wasn’t anticipating the extent or the strength of our unity. And the more his back is against the wall, the greater the severity of the tactics he may employ."" Biden reiterated accusations that Putin is considering resorting to using chemical or biological weapons, though Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said Tuesday that the United States has seen no evidence to suggest that use of such weapons was ""imminent.""

It is reported that, 8 people were killed in the Russian attack on shopping mall. Talks to end the fighting have continued by video but failed to bridge the chasm between the two sides. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy told Ukrainian television late Monday that he would be prepared to consider waiving any bid by Ukraine to join — a key Russian demand — in exchange for a cease-fire, the withdrawal of Russian troops and a guarantee of Ukraine’s security. Zelenskyy also suggested Kyiv would be open to future discussions on the status of Crimea, which Russia seized in 2014, and areas of the eastern Donbas region held by Russian-backed separatists. But he said that was a topic for another time. As part of a series of addresses to foreign legislatures to drum up support for Ukraine, Zelenskyy spoke to Italian lawmakers on Tuesday, telling them that the besieged port of Mariupol had been utterly destroyed in the Russian onslaught. He also spoke to Pope Francis. ""Imagine a Genoa completely burned down,"" he said to rapt lawmakers, citing an Italian port city of a similar size. Mariupol officials said on March 15 that at least 2,300 people had died in the siege, and they have not given an update since. Zelenskyy said 117 children had been killed in the war so far. 'S Some people managed to flee Mariupol, where weeks of Russian bombardment has cut off electricity, water and food supplies and severed communication with the outside world. The city council said Tuesday that more than 1,100 people who had escaped the besieged city were on their way in a convoy of buses to another city to Mariupol’s northwest. But the Red Cross said a humanitarian aid convoy trying to reach the embattled city with desperately needed supplies still had not been able to enter.

The siege of Mariupol has cut the city off from the sea and allowed Russia to establish a land corridor to Crimea. But it’s not clear how much of the city it holds, with fleeing residents saying fighting continues street by street. Ukraine’s Defense Ministry said Tuesday that their forces were still defending the city and had destroyed a Russian patrol boat and electronic warfare complex. Britain’s Defense Ministry said its intelligence showed that ""Ukrainian forces continue to repulse Russian attempts to occupy"" the city. Those who have made it out of Mariupol told of a devastated city. ""Mariupol is almost 99% destroyed,"" said 39-year-old Viktoria Totsen, who managed to escape the city and cross into Poland. ""They bombed us for the past 20 days. During the last five days the planes were flying over us every five seconds and dropped bombs everywhere — on residential buildings, kindergartens, art schools, everywhere."" In all, more than 8,000 people escaped to safer areas Monday through humanitarian corridors, including about 3,000 from Mariupol, Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said. Overall, more than 3.5 million people have fled Ukraine, while another 6.5 million have been displaced inside the country.",17,3.6078118816962763,2.9069704598926758,0.7008414218036005,25

""We've assessed, for the first time, that the Russians may be slightly below a 90% level of assessed available combat power,"" a senior defense official told reporters. Ukrainian soldiers are seen near a collapsed bridge that was the target of a Russian missile, near the town of Irpin, Ukraine, on March 3, 2022. ; The drop in power is reflective of the 150,000 soldiers he amassed on Ukraine’s border in the lead-up to the invasion last month. ""It is not an assessment of all Russian military power,"" the senior defense official added. Security officials continue to warn that Putin may be looking to bring supplemental forces into Ukraine to aid his war as Russian ground forces remain stalled across the country. But there is scant evidence that any foreign fighters have headed to Ukraine despite reports that Putin has offered incentives to fighters from nations like Syria. The senior defense official said there are indications of continued ""discussions"" by Moscow to aid its war ""both in terms of resupply and also reinforcement,"" but there is no indication any such plan has been enacted. Experts anticipate that if the Kremlin does move to send in reinforcements, it would pull support from troops stationed outside of Russia before pulling additional troops from inside its own borders. ""Of the battalion tactical groups that Mr. Putin has available to him across Russia, he's used about 75% in this particular operation,"" the senior defense official explained. ""So I think our assumption would be he'd pull from outside the country first.""

But despite weeks of shelling, Putin’s troops have not been able to make significant progress in advancing on the capital city of Kyiv. ""We're definitely seeing anecdotal evidence that the Ukrainians are not only defending well, where they choose to defend, but they are making efforts to take back territory,"" the senior defense official added. Reports surfaced Tuesday showing that Ukrainian forces were able to retake a suburb outside of Kyiv, but the senior defense official said they were unable to verify the reporting. Citing the Russian Ministry of Defense, a Russian tabloid claimed this week that 9,861 Russian troops had been killed in the fighting with another 16,000 injured – a stark difference from the 498 troops killed and 1,597 reported as injured by the ministry on March 2. The report has since been taken down and the Pentagon has been unable to verify any causality estimates during the 27-day war. A man covers a dead body after residential buildings were hit by a Russian attack in Chernihiv, Ukraine.

Russia's invasion of Mariupol and other key Ukrainian cities like Kyiv have forced people underground and destroyed signs of civilization, leaving people without food, water, electricity and ways to communicate with their families. Maria Smarovailo, a Mariupol native who has since left the city, told Fox News Digital that there has been ""no food for more than three weeks."" Local residents stay at a bomb shelter during Ukraine-Russia conflict in the besieged southern port city of Mariupol, Ukraine March 20, 2022. ""In the first week of hostiles in the city, residents bought food in stores en masse,"" she said, according to a translation. When electricity, water and cellphone signals were cut, people began collecting snow and rainwater and looting stores that were still standing ""to get at least some food and water for children."" : She added later that Russians are not allowing humanitarian aid into the city, and ""many people do not know that volunteers are working to evacuate people"" because there is no internet or cellphone signal for residents to communicate with one another. Only those with cars are successful in helping people escape because Russian forces are not allowing buses into Mariupol's city limits, she said.

I’ve frequently been there when conflicts peaked and I’ve unfortunately witnessed the very worst of humanity. But while war zones are inherently cruel, few are designed like Mariupol — aimed to inflict maximum human suffering, to be Putin's funhouse of terror. Putin's use of sweeping terror tactics is no accident. The targeting of civilians in mass bombing campaigns is designed to force Ukraine's population into submission, to convince residents in larger cities like Kyiv that resistance is futile and will only lead to total devastation and huge death tolls. This is a playbook the Russian dictator honed in Aleppo, the Syrian city Russian forces levelled in 2016 in their brutal intervention to prop up the regime of Bashar Al-Assad. I saw this at first hand - the bunker buster bombs dropped on buildings specifically to exterminate whole families, the kids picked off by snipers on their way to school, the way that hospitals were the key targets of Russian attacks. These are all war crimes of course, but Putin got away with it in Syria. Europeans kept buying oil and gas from the Kremlin. Obama promised to intervene and then when the 'red line' of chemical weapons use was crossed, he bottled it.

2022-03-21,Fox,https://www.foxnews.com/world/eu-war-crimes-ukraine-new-sanctions-unlikely,EU slams ‘war crimes’ in Ukraine but new sanctions unlikely,"European Union countries on Monday accused the Russian armed forces of committing war crimes in Ukraine, but appeared unlikely to impose new sanctions on Moscow despite a clamor across Europe for those responsible for attacks on civilians to be held to account. With civilian deaths mounting in the besieged port city of Mariupol, German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock highlighted the increase in Russian attacks on civilian infrastructure, including hospitals and theaters. The ""courts will have to decide, but for me these are clearly war crimes,"" Baerbock said. : foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said before he chaired a meeting of the 27-nation bloc’s foreign ministers in Brussels that ""what’s happening in Mariupol is a massive war crime. Destroying everything, bombarding and killing everybody in an indiscriminate manner. This is something awful."" The encircled southern city on the Sea of Azov has seen some of the worst horrors of the war. Multiple attempts to evacuate residents from Mariupol have failed or only partly succeeded. City officials said at least 2,300 people have died in the siege, with some buried in mass graves. 'S Borrell underlined that ""war also has law."" The International Criminal Court in the Netherlands is gathering evidence about any possible war crimes in Ukraine, but Russia, like the United States, doesn’t recognize the tribunal’s jurisdiction. European foreign policy chief Josep Borrell, left, speaks with French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian during a meeting of the foreign ministers at the Europa building in Brussels, Monday, Mar. 21, 2022. European foreign ministers are debating how to respond to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney said his country is ""certainly open to other mechanisms for accountability in terms of the atrocities that are taking place in Ukraine right now."" Coveney said Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is probably the first ""war being played out on social media, where people see images happening live, and they’re outraged by it."" ""This is driving a fury across the European Union within the public as to why can’t we stop this,"" he told reporters. ""They want people held to account for the decisions taken and the brutality that we have seen."" : , - The imposition of a new round of sanctions — asset freezes and travel bans — appears unlikely for now. Notorious for their often slow handling of fast moving international events, nations have rallied in just over three weeks since the invasion began on Feb. 24 to slap sanctions on 877 people. They include Russian President Vladimir Putin, senior ministers and pro-Kremlin oligarchs. A further 62 ""entities"" – companies, banks, airlines and ship builders – have also been hit in near record time. But the issue of imposing restrictive measures on energy remains extremely sensitive, given the dependence of many countries on supplies of Russia natural gas. Dutch Foreign Minister Wopke Hoekstra, left, speaks with Greek Foreign Minister Nikos Dendias during a meeting of the foreign ministers at the Europa building in Brussels, Monday, March 21, 2022. A group of countries led by Germany wants a pause on new measures for now, amid concern about high energy prices and fears that Russia might halt gas exports to Europe. Some also want to save sanction ammunition for any new and major war atrocity, like the use of chemical weapons. ""We are doing everything to close loopholes in the sanctions"" that have already been agreed, Baerbock said. But Lithuanian Foreign Minister Gabrielius Landsbergis, whose country borders Russia and Belarus, warned against ""sanctions fatigue."" : 10 , ""We cannot get tired, imposing sanctions. We cannot get tired, offering assistance and help to Ukraine,"" he said. He said the must start thinking about what kind of attack by Russia would constitute a ""red line"" for tougher measures. The shelling of cities and civilians, he said, doesn’t appear to be enough to persuade some member countries ""but somewhere there, there has to be one.""

The White House said the hack was likely carried out by a criminal group based in Russia. The attack on came just weeks after the largest U.S. fuel pipeline, the East Coast's Colonial Pipeline, was targeted by a criminal group originating in Russia. Biden, during his summit in Geneva with Russian President Vladimir Putin in June 2021, raised the issue of ransomware. Biden, at the time, said he told Putin that ""certain critical infrastructure should be off limits to attack."" Biden said he gave a list of ""16 specific entities defined as critical infrastructure,"" saying it ranged from energy to water systems. Putin, though, during his press conference after the meeting, denied that Russia was responsible for cyberattacks and instead claimed that most cyberattacks in the world were carried out from the U.S. Biden in July signed a national security memorandum directing his administration to develop cybersecurity performance goals for critical infrastructure in the U.S. – entities like electricity utility companies, chemical plants and nuclear reactors.

The fall of Mariupol would allow Russian forces across southern and eastern Ukraine to link up. But Western military analysts say that even if the surrounded city is taken, the troops battling for control there a block at a time may be too depleted to help secure Russian breakthroughs on other fronts. Three weeks into the invasion, Western governments and analysts see the conflict shifting to a war of attrition, with bogged down Russian forces launching long-range missiles at cities and military bases as Ukrainian forces carry out hit-and-run attacks and seek to sever their supply lines. The strike on the art school was the second time in less than a week that local officials reported an attack on a public building where Mariupol residents had taken shelter. A bomb hit a theater where more than 1,000 people were believed to be sheltering on Wednesday. There was no immediate word on casualties from the reported strike on the school, which The Associated Press could not independently verify. Ukrainian officials have not given an update on the search of the theater since Friday, when they said at least 130 people had been rescued and another 1,300 were trapped by rubble. City officials and aid groups have described dire conditions in Mariupol, where food, water and electricity have run low and the fighting has prevented humanitarian convoys from reaching the city. The Russian siege also severed communication lines in Mariupol, making it difficult to verify reports from the city.

""To do this to a peaceful city, what the occupiers did, is a terror that will be remembered for centuries to come,"" Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in his nightly video address to the nation. ""The more Russia uses terror against Ukraine, the worse the consequences for it."" Unexpectedly strong Ukrainian resistance has dashed Russian President Vladimir Putin’s hopes for a fast victory after he ordered his troops to invade Ukraine on Feb. 24. In recent days, Russian forces have battled their way into Mariupol, cutting it off from the Azov Sea and devastating a massive steel plant. But the city’s fall could prove a costly victory. , , ' ' ""The block-by-block fighting in Mariupol itself is costing the Russian military time, initiative and combat power,"" the Washington-based Institute for the Study of War said in a briefing. In a blunt assessment of the war in Ukraine, the think tank concluded that Russia failed in its initial campaign to take the capital, Kyiv, and other major cities quickly and its stalled invasion is creating the conditions for a ""very violent and bloody"" stalemate. In major cities across Ukraine, hundreds of men, women and children have already been killed in Russian bombardments, while millions have raced to underground shelters or fled the country.

Russian Defense Ministry spokesperson Igor Konashenkov said Kalibr cruise missiles launched by Russian warships from the Caspian Sea were also involved in the strike on the fuel depot in Kostiantynivka and were used to destroy an armor repair plant in northern Ukraine. Western analysts have downplayed the significance of Russia’s use of the hypersonic weapon, saying the missiles did not give Moscow an extra advantage but were a tool the Kremlin could use to advertise its military might and warn other countries against intervening. - ""It’s not a game-changer,"" but rather a ""message of intimidation and deterrence toward Ukraine and toward the West,"" said Valeriy Akimenko, senior research associate at the Conflict Studies Research Centre in England.

The Russian military hasn’t confirmed the deaths of any of them. The death of one general was confirmed by his associate and an officers’ group in Russia. Russia would need 800,000 troops – almost equal to its entire active-duty military – to control Ukraine in the face of prolonged armed opposition, according to Michael Clarke, former head of the British-based Royal United Services Institute, a defense think tank. ""Unless the Russians intend to be completely genocidal – they could flatten all the major cities, and Ukrainians will rise up against Russian occupation – there will be just constant guerrilla war,"" Clarke said. , - Ukraine and Russia have held several rounds of negotiations aimed at ending the conflict, but the neighboring countries remain divided over several issues.

Jack Keane assesses the state of Russia's invasion of Ukraine on 'Hannity.' Ret. Gen. Jack Keane told ""Hannity"" on Friday that Russia is bringing more troops from the Eastern Military District after a ""stalemate"" in the North. . : What's happened here is we have a stalemate in the North in the battle for Kyiv and also the battle for Kharkiv, so much so that all offensive operations in both of those areas by the Russians have just stopped. They know full well that they are not able to complete the encirclement of either one of those cities and bring in their artillery, which would be the main element to hammer the city itself and create a devastation there. So what's actually happening then? … What they're doing is they're bringing more troops from the Eastern Military District. They've arrived in Belarus, and they're crossing the border into Ukraine. There will be fresh troops, not particularly better than what's already there, to be frank about it — poorly led, poorly trained, likely having low morale, not knowing why they're there, but they're going to put them into the fight. There's also their best military organization as the first guards tank army based in the vicinity of Moscow. They've had a couple of the smaller elements from them in the fight early on. Now they're bringing larger elements out. This is the organization that keeps Putin in power at all costs. So the fact that they have committing them into this fight indicates that they really intend to still take those cities physically. They have not given up on that.",14,4.048319204933026,5.831682989335342,-1.783363784402316,24

United States Central Command Commander Gen. Frank McKenzie said there was ""little evidence"" that foreign fighters were traveling from Syria to Ukraine as Russia looks to ramp up recruitment for its war. ""We see little evidence of recruiting in Syria to bring people back to Ukraine,"" McKenzie told reporters Friday. ""Not saying it couldn't happen, and I'm not saying that one or two, three or four haven't gone. But we haven't seen the large-scale effort to do that."" 'S ' ' ’S - Syrian army soldiers fire their weapons during a battle with rebel fighters at the Ramouseh front line, east of Aleppo, Syria, Monday, Dec. 5, 2016. The general’s comments were in response to questions on Russian President Vladimir Putin’s reported efforts to have Syrians join the fight in Ukraine. Earlier this month, Syrian news website DeirEzzor24 claimed that Moscow was offering six-month contracts with pay ranging between $200 and $300 a month in a push to increase its force posture in Ukraine. ""We find noteworthy that Putin believes that he needs to rely on foreign fighters to supplement what is a very significant commitment of combat power inside Ukraine as it is,"" a senior defense official told reporters earlier this month. ""They continue to be frustrated by a stiff Ukrainian resistance, as well as their own internal challenges."" The general said that despite its slow progress in Ukraine, the U.S. has not seen any signs Russia is changing its ""force level"" in Syria or other parts of the world, including in Central Asia, where Russia has a significant presence in countries like Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan. ""We have no evidence that the Russians are intent on escalating anything in Syria,"" McKenzie said. But added, ""I think we're well postured for anything that could happen, and we’re prepared for any eventuality."" McKenzie, who is set to retire soon, touched on other top issues for ’s area of responsibility, which includes Northeast Africa, the Middle East along with Central and South Asia. - Syrian soldiers hold up Baath party flags and a portrait of Syrian President Bashar Assad. With its war on Ukraine now in its third week, Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday, March 11, 2022, approved bringing in volunteer fighters from the Middle East into the conflict. : ""Not a day goes by that I don't think about August of last year,"" he said in reference to the chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan that led to the death of 13 U.S. service members on Aug. 26, 2021. ""You go back, and you always try to find ways, things that you could have done different, but I will just tell you this,"" he continued, ""the battlefield is a dynamic place. It is not a business plan. It is a contest of wills. It is a contest of plans."" ""We stopped a number of attacks, we were not able to stop this attack,"" he added. ""I don't know what we could have done that would have prevented this particular attack."" McKenzie drew on the similarities between the war in Ukraine and the Taliban’s near immediate push to overthrow the Afghan government. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has garnered international praise for his refusal to leave Kyiv as Russian forces continue to pummel the nation and security officials warn Putin will look to overthrow him and instate a puppet regime instead. As the Taliban stormed across Afghanistan and advanced on the capital city of Kabul, former President Ashraf Ghani drew international criticism for his decision to flee on Aug. 15. The next day Kabul fell to the Taliban. Russia’s failure to quickly take over Ukraine, despite its sheer size and superior armed forces, has left many questioning why the Afghan armed services were not able to hold off an insurgent group after years of training by U.S. forces. Ukrainian soldiers take positions outside a military facility as two cars burn, in a street in Kyiv, Ukraine, Saturday, Feb. 26, 2022. Russian troops stormed toward Ukraine's capital Saturday, and street fighting broke out as city officials urged residents to take shelter. ""You can train an army, you can equip an army,"" McKenzie said. ""What you can’t give an army is the fighting spirit of an individual soldier."" ""Clearly the Ukrainians have tremendous fighting spirit,"" he continued. ""They’re defending their homes, they’re defending their country."" McKenzie also pointed out that Russian soldiers do not appear ""particularly motivated or engaged in the campaign."" The general said he viewed the failure of the Afghan army to oppose the Taliban as ""not just a military collapse but really a national collapse – ultimately [they] couldn’t find the will to stand and fight."" ""And I’m still digesting that,"" McKenzie told reporters. ""The collapse of the Afghan government was not the result we desired.""",14,3.7263160287425228,5.748899365369249,-2.0225833366267265,11

A senior U.S. defense official hesitated to comment on the broad morale of the Russian forces, but he acknowledged some ""anecdotal indications"" that morale is ""not high in some units."" , : ""Some of that is, we believe, a function of poor leadership, lack of information that the troops are getting about their mission and objectives, and I think disillusionment from being resisted as fiercely as they have been,"" the official explained. ""But, again, I want to stress that these are anecdotal accounts.""

""That’s what you want to use artillery for, and so we haven’t seen that manifest itself,"" the senior defense official told reporters Thursday. ""We’re just seeing them move them into place, but they clearly are trying, particularly around Kyiv, to improve their ability to hit the city from afar with munitions."" ‘ ’ Additionally, defense officials have seen no changes in either air superiority or indication of an imminent amphibious invasion.

2022-03-17,Fox,https://www.foxnews.com/world/us-putin-nuclear-threats-russia-ukraine,US fears Putin may lean on nuclear threats if Russia continues to fail in Ukraine,"—Graphic footage: Fox News correspondent Greg Palkot has the latest on the Russia-Ukraine war on 'Special Report.' U.S. intelligence officials believe Vladimir Putin may threaten to unleash Russia’s nuclear arsenal if Ukrainian defense forces continue to thwart his invasion of their country. Lt. Gen. Scott Berrier, director of the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency, revealed the concerns in a new report on global threats dated March 15 and obtained by Fox News Thursday. ""As this war and its consequences slowly weaken Russian conventional strength, Russia likely will increasingly rely on its nuclear deterrent to signal the West and project strength to its internal and external audiences,"" he wrote. Defense Intelligence Agency Director Lt. Gen. Scott Berrier testifies during a House Intelligence Committee hearing on diversity in the intelligence community, on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., October 27, 2021. : He found that Moscow’s recent adjustments to its nuclear readiness ""are likely intended to intimidate,"" and that the Kremlin could threaten the use of ""tactical, non-strategic nuclear weapons"" to scare an adversary into backing down from conflict through an agreement that would be drafted in Russia’s favor. Berrier also noted that Putin would be likely to threaten use of his nuclear arsenal as a deterrent to third parties. Such a stance is evident in how U.S. and leaders have refused requests from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to impose a no-fly zone over his country that would put Western militaries in direct conflict with Russian jets. Russian President Vladimir Putin attends a meeting of the Supreme Eurasian Economic Council in Yerevan, Armenia. : ' ' U.S. officials believe Putin intends to ""overturn the U.S.-led rules based post-Cold War international order"" and reclaim former Soviet territories. ""Russia views a powerful, survivable nuclear force as the foundation of its national security, and its modernized general purposes forces as critical to meet any conventional military threat and project Russian power abroad,"" Berrier wrote. He noted that Russia spent that last year publicly accusing of increasingly ""encroaching on its borders"" and finds the prospect of a Western-aligned Ukraine ""unacceptable"" and a ""major political-military catastrophe."" However, Putin’s invasion of Ukraine has stalled after three weeks, with Ukrainian defense forces outperforming the expectations of Russian military intelligence, according to Western analysts. The United Kingdom’s Ministry of Defense on Thursday described the Russian invasion as ""faltering"" due to sloppy logistics and poor planning. - , ""Incessant Ukrainian counterattacks are forcing Russia to divert large numbers of troops to defend their own supply lines,"" the ministry said in a statement. ""This is severely limiting Russia’s offensive potential."" As a result, Russian forces are increasingly using ""indiscriminate methods"" of attack – long-range artillery and missiles -- that are leveling cities, killing civilians and damaging infrastructure in retaliation for Ukraine’s effective resistance, according to the report. The also called into question Putin’s credibility on his claims to have ""modernized"" the Russian military. Rescuers work at a site of buildings damaged by a shelling, as Russia's attack on Ukraine continues, in Kyiv, Ukraine, in this handout picture released March 17, 2022. ""Russia’s modernization is intended to ensure Russia can field a military capable of engaging in the full spectrum of warfare to deter or defeat a wide scope of threats, but initial setbacks in Ukraine call some of Putin’s narrative into question,"" Berrier wrote. At the same time, Russia claims it has updated more than 85% of its nuclear weapons and is working on developing missiles that are capable of circumventing Western defenses in order to ""ensure that Russia can credibly inflict unacceptable damage on the West."" Putin often brags about his country’s development of fifth-generation fighter jets, according to the report. ""Russia continues to improve capabilities for its Ground Forces, Airborne Forces, and coastal troops. It is upgrading main battle tanks and introducing new s, artillery, and multiple rocket launchers to its arsenal. Russia has also steadily increased its number of battalion tactical groups —the Ground Force’s primary maneuver element,"" Berrier wrote. ""In 2021, Russia’s Defense Minister claimed its force structure could generate 168 s, which is a 75 percent increase from the 96 s it claimed it could generate in 2016."" Within the next decade, he warned, Russia could also field next-generation nuclear weapons including a new heavy intercontinental ballistic missile, ""a transoceanic torpedo"" and a new intercontinental cruise missile.

""Russia almost certainly maintains biological and chemical weapon programs,"" Berrier wrote. ""The United States Government asserts that Russia is not in compliance with its obligations under the Chemical Weapons Convention , in part because of its use of a nerve agent—referred to as Novichok—in the attempted assassination of former Russian Main Intelligence Directorate intelligence officer Sergey Skripal and his daughter in March 2018.""",3,4.3074542527378465,4.244955298234993,0.062498954502853366,9

2022-03-17,Fox,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/battle-kyiv-brutal-michael-pregent-jon-sweet,The battle for Kyiv is coming and it will be brutal unless we act now,"Bret Baier, Dan Hoffman and Gen. Keith Kellogg weigh in on President Zelenskyy's appeal for help in his virtual address. It's coming, and it's going to be ugly. Urban battles often are – Stalingrad, Berlin, Hue, Sarajevo, Ramadi. The casualties will be tantamount to World War levels, the atrocities will be numerous, and the outcome will haunt the Western world for decades knowing we could have done more to prevent it. The Battle for Kyiv – the heart and soul of the country, will become Ukraine’s Alamo, with similar results unless we do something now. The parallels to the Alamo are uncanny. A numerically superior force besieging a city that will eventually overwhelm well-entrenched, determined and fiercely patriotic defenders who are prepared to give their lives for their country and their independence. In the military, we call this a Die in Place mission. 'S 'S A - President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is a modern-day James Bowie; Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin is President General Antonio López de Santa Anna. One will fight to the death for the values we as Americans hold dear – life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness, and the other will simply give the orders, from sanctuary, to attack and destroy the city, at all cost. It will be a heroic last stand. Then Putin will become our problem. Russia continues to shape the battlefield, slowly and at tremendous cost, but the Russian Army is closing in on Kyiv. Putin has what Zelenskyy needs – time, numbers and artillery, lots of artillery. This will be a four phase operation: Phase I – Build Combat Power; Phase – Condition Setting; Phase – Assault the Objective; and Phase – Secure a Destroyed Kyiv. The Ukrainian fighters are intuitive, adaptive and formidable. With the right weapon systems, sustained logistics and intelligence, they can take the fight to the Russians. We’re currently in Phase I, as the Russian military continues to lumber toward Kyiv. During this phase, we’ll see the formation of artillery groups capable of punishing Kyiv from a distance, the maneuver units – battalion tactical groups will move into their assault positions, and a much-improved rear area security force will be emplaced to protect their logistical points and routes. Putin has become increasingly frustrated with his military’s inability to secure Ukraine. Throughout Phase I and Phase , we’ll continue to see the build-up of combat power to replace the troops/units that were rendered combat ineffective. If Putin does introduce foreign mercenaries from Chechnya and Syria, we’ll observe their arrival in this phase. Their presence on the battlefield will become a key indicator in the location of the main effort. Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Russia's Vladimir Putin The siege of Kyiv begins in Phase . The Russians will begin with a siege, an operation to deny Kyiv’s defenders food and water, resupply of ammunition, and communications to the outside world. They will knock out the power grid, the water supply, and communication nodes . Lines of communication into and out of the city will be severed and secured. The defenders will be isolated and the rationing of supplies will begin. Reconnaissance and probing of the Ukrainian defenses will be relentless, keeping the defenders in a constant state of alert. Next, the artillery preparation, at a scale not experienced since World War I – Verdun and the Somme. It will be devastating, and will level the city. It will, however, provide the surviving defenders excellent defensive fighting positions during Phase . The key to success for Phase I and is the amount of time given to set the conditions for success in Phase . Putin has become increasingly frustrated with his military’s inability to secure Ukraine; he is not a patient man. Putin so far has not listened to his generals’ advice on setting conditions. Will he continue to ignore their cautions or will he command them to take the city at all cost with the forces they have? At the conclusion of the artillery barrage, we’ll see the initiation of Phase . The ground force will begin their assault on the city, and it will be a slug fest. The fighting will be intense – street to street, house to house, neighborhood to neighborhood, above ground and below ground. Booby traps, improvised explosive devices , grenades, snipers, Molotov cocktails, bayonets, hand-to-hand, and more. Conventional military tactics dictate a 5:1 ratio of attacking soldiers to defenders. Putin isn’t likely to have that number, and must rely upon his artillery bombardment to make up for the shortage. The casualties will be staggering. Despite his assurances on March 8 to Russian mothers who accused him of ""using their sons as cannon fodder,"" he will use conscripts during the initial assault. He can’t afford to lose his professional soldiers, nor his mercenary force. They will exploit success, but not be exposed to urban warfare conditions. The fighting in the city will be intense, and the loss of life will degrade Russian capability, but the cost in human capital of securing the terrain that was captured will also significantly reduce combat power as the Russian Army assaults Kyiv. Failure to secure the terrain exposes the assaulting forces to attacks from their rear. Furthermore, a sizable force must be left outside the city to prevent additional Ukrainian fighters and supplies from entering or exiting the city. The shortage of manpower could be offset by other means – not consistent with the laws of war. War crimes have not been a deterrent during this conflict, or in Syria, where Russia employed chlorine gas, and it’s not likely to prevent him from using illegal chem-bio agents again to gain a tactical advantage. He will believe statements from the White House that ""there are no red lines within the borders of Ukraine."" Terrain denial by use of persistent chemical agents, use of a non-persistent agent to uproot and expose Ukrainian fighters and their defensive positions, and the use of a thermobaric weapon – aerosol bomb, fuel air explosive to destroy hardened fighting positions or command-and-control centers in civilian populated areas – all are violations of International Law. When the city has been ""secured,"" the Russian military will enter Phase of their operations, and thus begin their counterinsurgency phase. The requirement for additional forces to replace those lost in the battle for the city, and now for the security of the country, will further drain Russian resources, but the punishment of Ukraine will be complete, and the message to other non- members delivered. Of course, the enemy always gets a vote, as Putin has learned over the past three weeks. The response to Putin’s punishment of Ukraine will be from the insurgency, and they will exact their punishment over time. Declaring ""mission complete"" in Phase signals the toughest fight is yet to come. A lesson the U.S. learned over two decades in two theaters of combat. The Ukrainian fighters are intuitive, adaptive and formidable. With the right weapon systems, sustained logistics and intelligence, they can take the fight to the Russians. The Stinger missiles , Javelin anti-tank missiles, and 7.62mm ammunition they received have been put to excellent use, interdicting Russian convoys and repelling armor attacks. But if Ukraine is going to weather this storm, they need to eliminate their biggest threat – indirect fires, aka artillery, the ""King of Battle."" It will be the single most casualty producing weapon on the battlefield.

Putin and his defense minister, Sergei Shoigu, recently declared that as many as 16,000 combatants from the Middle East will enter the Ukrainian war on the side of Russia. The promised pay, according to news reports, is around $3,000 per month. , ‘ ’ : . ""It appears that Russia has opened 14 mercenary recruitment centers in Syria in territories controlled by the regime of Bashar al-Assad ,"" Theodore Karasik, a fellow on Russian and Middle Eastern Affairs at the Jamestown Foundation in Washington, told Fox News Digital. ""After a short training, the mercenaries will be transported to Russia through the Khmeimim Air Base by two Tu-134 and Tu-154 aircraft to the Chkalovsky Air Base, Moscow region."" : Karasik added that ""We need to be aware that there is an information war ongoing regarding the recruitment of fighters by multiple parties to this conflict. There is some evidence that these fighters will enter into the battle space in greater numbers in the coming weeks."" The battle space, he continued, ""is being prepared for partisan warfare and taking lessons learned from Grozny and Syria are going to be important for all actors. Recruitment drives are robust and supported by state actors."" Service members gather in a square during head of the Chechen Republic Ramzan Kadyrov's address, dedicated to a military conflict in Ukraine, in Grozny, Russia, Feb. 25, 2022. Grozny saw intensive urban warfare conducted by Russian forces during the initial stages of the First Chechen War in 1994-95 and the Second Chechen War in 1999-2000, with some military observers claiming they are now doing the same with Ukraine. Karasik said the recruiting effort is about applying Syrian fighters’ capacity in another theater because of the experience they acquired in the long civil war. ""I think it's a mixed picture because of the multiple groups [in Syria] and how they’ve split and come back together again,"" he said. ""So really, it’s about the quality of the recruits, and what we need to look at next is who are they really sending? Who is signing up for this? How do they guarantee the quality of the fighters?"" Brig. Gen. Ahmad Rahal, who resigned in protest from the Syrian military in 2012 over the policies of President Bashar Assad and joined the opposition Free Syria Army, told Fox News Digital that the Russians will use the Syrian and other mercenaries to carry out the ""dirty tasks"" of fighting in the cities, which will lead to more civilian deaths and it will help them avoid being blamed for the war crimes. ""The Russian army is besieging most of the Ukrainian cities, and now it is taking the appropriate fighting arrangement around the cities, and the next stage will be military operations by storming the cities, and these mercenaries coming from Syria from Assad’s army and Assad’s mercenaries will perform a large part of those tasks,"" Rahal said. He added, ""As a military observer, it is clear that the Russian army had to change its military plans. At first the Russians wanted a classic war, a war of armies, and the task assigned to the Russian army was a lightning and quick operation that President Putin called a ‘special operation’ through which the Ukrainian army would be crushed and then the leadership would collapse political in the capital Kyiv, but this did not happen."" The brigadier general noted that, ""It is clear that the Ukrainian military leadership was a good reader of the military reality and the great difference between the capabilities of the Russian army and the capabilities of the Ukrainian army, so the Ukrainian leadership succeeded in dragging the Russian army into a war of resistance around cities, a guerrilla war, a war of ambushes, and later a street war if the Russian army stormed the Ukrainian cities."" Rahal said his information about the forces coming to fight in Ukraine included the following units: the 4th Division, commanded by Assad’s brother; the Syrian army’s special forces; the republican guard; the 25th division; the Russian backed 5th Corps; and ""the Palestinian Al-Quds Brigade, which is fighting with the Assad army ; and the National Defense Forces militias ."" : ? The Assad regime has been engulfed in war since 2011, when the Syrian dictator launched a violent crackdown on citizens seeking democracy. Russian forces intervened in 2015 to crush the revolt. The Syrian civil war has resulted in over 500,000 deaths. Retired Col. Richard Kemp, who commanded British troops in Afghanistan, told Fox News Digital, ""It’s not clear how many Syrians or other fighters from the Middle East are likely to answer Russia’s call. They will have to be paid significant amounts to volunteer to do so. There is no doubt that among them will be Islamic State jihadists who might be looking to stay in Russia or even travel on from there to Western Europe. They are likely to be disappointed if that is their aim, unless Putin is looking to help some of them infiltrate westwards."" In this image released by the Syrian Presidency, Russian President Vladimir Putin, left, meets with Syrian President Bashar Assad in Damascus, Syria, on Tuesday, Jan. 7, 2020. Kemp noted that ""Middle Eastern fighters will be used to a completely different form of conflict than they will find in Ukraine. They are unlikely to be a match for well-armed and organized Ukrainian forces, but Putin will be happy to throw them away as cannon fodder."" Rahal concluded with this warning: ""As a Syrian general, I refuse to push the Syrians into that war that Putin declared against the peaceful people of Ukraine. Putin wants to achieve political and personal goals at the expense of the Ukrainian people, and this is what Putin did before here in Syria.""",14,3.8179046591832577,4.61358418692503,-0.7956795277417719,11

Keith Kellogg on Russian President Vladimir Putin’s invasion expanding to central, west Ukraine. Vladimir Putin’s strategy is ""escalation without an endgame,"" the White House said Friday. Don’t you believe it. Putin knows what he wants: to catch Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and take Kyiv. As the revealed last week, Putin expected a two-day war. Then came Zelenskyy. Two heroic weeks of unexpected fighting raised hopes, but now the battle for Kyiv is on and Putin is more determined than ever. And there’s very little left for the U.S. and to do, since the alliance is paralyzed by escalation fears. Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Russian President Vladimir Putin Like you, I've watched with grim satisfaction as Russia tripped up on maneuvers, stalled convoys, inept tank tactics and more. The ""video of Russian tank units near Brovary running away will be engraved in the memory of the whole world,"" praised Ukraine’s defense minister on Friday. 'S That phase of Russian indecision is over. Putin is going after Kyiv the ugly way. Putin has cranked up Russian firepower, with more ground-based missiles and airstrikes. Russian ground forces crept closer to Kyiv and the famous ""stalled convoy"" woke up and dispersed into the woods, the Pentagon reported Wednesday. Last week this could have been stopped with airpower. Now the war comes down to a close-in fight. Here’s what to expect. From Putin: Russia’s fighting mode is all about long-range firepower. Russian forces will take up artillery positions of relative safety and fire down on Kyiv. Next, Russia will continue to move smaller armored units – tanks – into Kyiv’s suburbs, heading for roads and bridges and testing Ukraine’s resistance. Look at the map. You can see how Russian forces already form pincers from east and west. Russia will try to choke off supplies to Ukraine’s military. Today, there are still 14 countries sending in supplies by road, rail and air. To the west, Russia will intensify new attacks on remaining airfields and other sites as with the strikes on Lutsk and the military airfield at Ivano-Frankivsk. Don’t forget there are three more nuclear power plants Russia doesn’t hold yet. Putin’s changed tactics and he is no rush. Remember Putin pushed the siege of Grozny from mid-October 1999 until February 2000. It was a lot like Ukraine: massive artillery, reconnaissance patrols, and a bloody ending with Chechen rebels gunned down in a minefield. When it was over, the U\.N. described Grozny as the ""most destroyed city on earth."" From Zelensky: The Ukrainian president's top job right now is to remain optimistic and let Ukraine’s military and civilians see they still have a chance to defeat Russia. On Friday, Zelensky praised Ukraine for holding out 16 days, four times longer than predicted, and encouraged Ukrainians to go ahead with spring planting. That’s optimism! But Zelensky’s military options are dwindling. His best tactic is to continue launching counter-attacks at multiple locations against the Russian tanks and patrols probing into Kyiv. The Javelin anti-tank missiles being successfully used by Ukraine reach about two miles and can be fired from inside buildings. They lock on the Russian target then pop up a few hundred feet to dive down and hit from above. Ukraine’s outnumbered defenders must harass and hit Russian resupply vehicles, too. Ukraine may drag out the fight until top Russian generals tell Putin they need more troops and supplies to take and hold Ukraine. But if Zelenskyy loses contact with supply lines outside Kyiv, he may choose an organized retreat of some Ukrainian forces and government functions out of Kyiv. ""Putin must fail,"" proclaimed British Prime Minister Boris Johnson. It would be nice to hope that the world might somehow intervene to impose a cease-fire. Unfortunately, Putin’s nuclear blackmail took 30 nations off the chess board. On the streets of Kyiv, it will be up to Zelenskyy to win or lose the war.",14,3.6026084114973465,3.052711315831947,0.5498970956653992,16

Russian forces took a second Ukrainian mayor captive, Ukrainian officials said Sunday.

""Locals hold protests demanding to free him."" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy pleaded with Western nations that communicate with Moscow – France, Germany, Israel and others – Saturday to help him free Fedorov, saying in an address, ""I'll talk to whoever I need to talk to in order for our people to be freed."" Zelenskyy said he spoke with French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz about the issue. His address came hours after Ukrainian Parliament announced Fedorov had been captured, saying a group of 10 ""occupiers"" put a plastic bag on the mayor’s head in Melitopol’s crisis center. ""This is yet another example of the illegal, cynical and barbaric acts perpetrated by the Russian armed forces in the context of their reckless and unprovoked aggression against Ukraine,"" European Parliament said in a statement in response to Fedorov’s abduction. ""We call on the Russian military authorities to free Mr. Ivan Fedorov immediately and to ensure that his health and safety is preserved.

Russian state-run media reported Saturday that prosecutors in Luhansk, a breakaway area recognized by Moscow in Ukraine’s disputed Donbas region, was preparing terrorism charges for Fedorov, accusing him of raising funds for far-right groups, the New York Times reported. Zelenskyy, who is Jewish and lost relatives to the Holocaust, said kidnapping Fedorov was intended to further Russian President Vladmir Putin’s unsubstantiated claims that Russian forces need to invade to liberate the Ukrainian people from neo-Nazis. Melitopol, located northeast of the Russian annexed Crimea, came under fierce fighting on the first day of the Russian invasion on Feb. 24. It has since been occupied by Russian forces, and Fedorov had been posting regular social media updates encouraging resistance, providing lists for which s were still working, where to purchase milk and medicine and warning that looters would be punished.

2022-03-13,Fox,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/charge-putin-war-crimes-gregg-jarrett,Charge Putin with war crimes – here's how the world can bring him to justice,": Graphic footage—State Department correspondent Benjamin Hall has the latest from Kyiv, Ukraine, on 'Special Report.' Bombing a maternity hospital, shelling residential buildings, firing on fleeing refugees, and destroying any infrastructure that supports the lives of innocent civilians … are all war crimes under international law. Whoever is involved in the chain of command that gave the orders – all the way up to the head of state – can and should be charged. This means Russian President Vladimir Putin must be indicted for war crimes. Russian President Vladimir Putin There is no question about who issued the orders. The invasion of Ukraine and the cruel bombing campaign cannot be blamed on a rogue Russian general. It was organized and directed by Putin himself. He admitted as much in his maniacal vows to destroy his perceived enemies in neighboring Ukraine. 'S Historically, the gathering of incriminating evidence has been both difficult and time-consuming. Perpetrators cover up their crimes and witnesses are reluctant to speak out in fear for their own lives. But the atrocities in Ukraine are different. On a daily basis, the world has watched in real time many of the war crimes committed by the military forces that Putin controls. Thanks to modern technology, the evidence has been collected by reporters with cameras, as well as Ukrainians on their cellphones or other devices. Satellite images confirm the death and destruction. The compilation and authentication of the damning evidence is no longer an obstacle as it once was. It has already been communicated electronically throughout the world and stored. We have watched it unfold with our own eyes. The appalling video of the bombings as they happened, photographs of mangled bodies of women and children, pictures of mass graves, and the personal accounts of the carnage by those who watched in horror constitute self-evident proof. In the city of Mariupol alone, some 1,200 civilians were slaughtered. That number seems to rise by the hour. The names of the victims and how they were massacred by Putin’s heavily armed troops have been meticulously recorded. The should establish a special tribunal, just as it did for the mass atrocities committed in the former Yugoslavia in the 1990s. In all, 18 health care facilities in Ukraine have been bombed in the Russian onslaught. Stores, schools, apartments, orphanages, markets, pharmacies and private businesses have been obliterated. The measure of human suffering and bloodshed is memorialized in searing images and documents. Putin’s crimes fall into three separate, but related categories spelled out by international law. The first is called ""crimes against humanity."" It is defined as ""a widespread or systematic attack directed against any civilian population."" Invading a sovereign nation without provocation and deliberately killing non-combatants, including women and children, clearly qualifies. So does Putin’s use of cluster bombs and his admitted deployment of thermobaric explosives that rupture the lungs of any civilians nearby. The second is known as ""war crimes."" They, too, involve the willful killing of civilians, inhumane treatment, destruction of property and intentionally causing great suffering. The barbarity of Putin’s military actions meets this definition. Millions of civilians have fled as entire communities have been laid to waste by indiscriminate bombings – their lives and livelihoods shattered. The third offense is identified as ""crimes of aggression."" This encompasses any unjustified attack or invasion by armed forces, bombardment, military occupation of territory and annexation. Again, this has been established. The International Criminal Court in The Hague, Netherlands, has announced that it opened a war crimes investigation. That may sound impressive, but the track record of the court is not. The is notoriously hobbled by inertia, dysfunction, weak management, endless jurisdictional disputes and feeble prosecutions. A better idea is for the United Nations to circumvent the and establish a special tribunal, just as it did for the mass atrocities committed in the former Yugoslavia during the Balkan Wars in the 1990s. In that case, 161 people were indicted for their crimes, including former Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic. Yes, Russia would veto the creation of a special tribunal in a vote by the five-member U.N. Security Council. But the General Assembly has the power to override the veto under a rather obscure provision called resolution 377. The language affords sufficient latitude. A United Nations vote should be undertaken with dispatch and the criminal tribunal organized. Since the evidence already exists, Putin and his cronies could be charged expeditiously. Placing Putin in the dock to account for his heinous crimes is a more vexing matter. The tribunal itself would have no police power to effectuate his arrest in Russia where the dictator is protected – for now. This means it will be up to the Russian people. The case of Milosevic is instructive. Massive anti-war demonstrations against his brutality eventually drove him from office, as up to 200,000 members of his military deserted him. Milosevic was arrested by his own people and carted off to the special tribunal to stand trial. The same fate could befall Putin if the citizens of Russia grow tired of his authoritarian rule and his suppression of their human rights. With economic disaster looming, they may in the near future rise up in anger against him. If Russians continue to suffer the dire effects of their own devolving financial situation and if living conditions deteriorate to unbearable levels, fury toward Putin could grow exponentially. Their willingness to tolerate a tyrant who has rained death and terror on Russia’s neighbor in his lust for power may reach a breaking point. Desperate conditions merit desperate actions by the people. Poverty and hunger drive revolutions. It has happened twice before in Russia in the last century. History could and should repeat itself. It is undeniable that Putin is an evil dictator who continues to commit monstrous acts in Ukraine. No sentient person would argue otherwise. Putin is plainly guilty of the despicable war crimes that I have described. And no, I will not grant him a presumption of innocence. But the special tribunal will. Time is of the essence. Bringing Putin and his comrades to justice must be a top priority.",13,5.040244953121039,4.5807287271869415,0.4595162259340979,2

2022-03-12,Fox,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/putin-reported-arrest-russian-intel-official-ukraine-invasion,Putin's reported arrest of Russian intel official shows frustration with progress of Ukraine invasion: expert,"Wisconsin Rep. Mike Gallagher and Florida Rep. Michael Waltz call on the Biden administration to supply Ukraine with 'everything they need' to defeat Russia. Russian President Vladimir Putin has reportedly placed one of his top intelligence officials on house arrest, a move that one expert tells Fox News Digital would be a sign that he is seeking to shift blame for a Ukrainian invasion that U.S. intelligence believes has not gone according to plan. According to a report from the Sunday Times, Russian journalist Andrei Soldatov claims that Putin has arrested the head of the Federal Security Service, Sergey Beseda. Fox News has not independently confirmed this. Putin, in the wake of Biden's comments, says Russia knows ""how to defend our own interests."" : ' A ' Beseda has reportedly been placed on house arrest along with his deputy Anatoly Bolyukh. The Federal Security Service, known as , is Russia’s top security and counterintelligence apparatus. One former U.S. intelligence officer tells Fox News Digital that the move signals Putin’s dissatisfaction with his intelligence community’s assessment of the Ukrainian invasion. ""It means that Putin is angry and recognized that he was not provided with accurate intelligence,"" Rebekah Koffler, a former U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency agent and author of ""Putin's Playbook: Russia's Secret Plan to Defeat America"", told Fox News Digital about the significance of the report. Ukrainian emergency employees and volunteers carry an injured pregnant woman from the damaged by shelling maternity hospital in Mariupol, Ukraine, : ' ' Vladimir Osechkin, an exiled Russian human rights activist, confirmed the arrests in the Sunday Times report and said that agents carried out searches at more than 20 Moscow addresses of colleagues who are suspected of contacting journalists. ""The formal basis for conducting these searches is the accusation of the embezzlement of funds earmarked for subversive activities in Ukraine,"" Osechkin said in the report. ""The real reason is unreliable, incomplete and partially false information about the political situation in Ukraine."" Koffler believes that Putin has assessed that his inability to capture control of Ukraine in a swift manner has to do with ""poor intelligence"" that has contributed to two major miscalculations. A Ukrainian soldier passes by houses in the village of Novoluhanske, Luhansk region, Ukraine. Those two missteps, Koffler says, are the failure to anticipate how fiercely Ukranians would fight for their homeland and the role technology would play in bringing the images of destruction to households across the world. ""He definitely miscalculated and now he feels that he’s trapped because he has to execute this operation and reach his goal,"" Koffler told Fox News. While U.S. officials say that Putin has been gaining ground in recent days in his push to capture the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv, it is widely believed that his invasion has not gone as efficiently as he had hoped. ""We continue to believe, based on what we've observed, that this resistance is greater than what the Russians expected,"" a U.S. official told Fox News during the first few days of the invasion. President Biden said this week that Putin has ""failed"" on multiple fronts during his invasion of Ukraine. ""He hoped to dominate Ukraine without a fight – he failed,"" Biden said Friday. ""He hoped to fracture European resolve – he failed. He hoped to weaken the transatlantic alliance – he failed. He hoped to split apart American democracies in terms of our positions – he failed.""",3,5.221435502326205,3.263295142978058,1.958140359348147,11

2022-03-11,Fox,https://www.foxnews.com/world/kyiv-russian-invasion-intelligence,US leaders predicted Kyiv's swift fall after Russian invasion. Why were they so wrong?,"Fox News State Department correspondent Benjamin Hall discusses the overnight Russian airstrike that left 21 dead, including 2 children, in Northeastern Ukraine on ‘Special Report.’ As Russia massed a large military presence on its border with Ukraine weeks before launching its invasion, Western intelligence officials were concerned the capital city of Kyiv could fall in a matter of days amid a Russian assault. Now two weeks into the conflict, the capital remained in Ukrainian hands and Russian troops have failed to make substantial progress as opposition forces continue to put up fierce resistance. Russian forces were reportedly trying to encircle the city, but the loss of equipment and personnel has taken its toll and significantly slowed their advance. Meanwhile, Moscow has targeted several Ukrainian cities with devastating airstrikes that have left civilians dead and forced many to flee to neighboring countries. : The predictions that Kyiv would fall, a major Russian objective, represented an intelligence failure, though not a major one, said Rebekah Koffler, a former Defense Intelligence Agency officer and author of ""Putin's Playbook: Russia's Secret Plan to Defeat America."" Part of the misstep by intelligence officials was the influence of previous events, she said, citing the disastrous withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan, the Sept. 11 attacks and the Iraq War. ""They're a little bit influenced by that and they wanted to telegraph to the policymakers the urgency,"" Koffler told Fox News. In early February, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark Milley told lawmakers during a closed-door briefing that Kyiv could fall within 72 hours after a full-scale Russian invasion. He said the operation could result in 15,000 Ukrainian military deaths and 4,000 Russian troop deaths.- : ‘’ That prediction, like predictions regarding how long Afghanistan's army could last without U.S. support, has already been disproved. Kyiv has held out long past the dire prognostication. The war grinds on. Last week, Russia claimed it had lost 498 military personnel, a figure widely disputed by the Pentagon, which put the death toll somewhere between 2,000 and 4,000. Ukraine has claimed nearly 11,000 Russian military deaths and the Kremlin is believed to be actively concealing the true number. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark A. Milley testifies on Capitol Hill, Sept. 29, 2021. The fact remains that Kyiv did not fall, and Afghanistan did not stand, despite Milley's speculations in May 2021 that the U.S.-backed government there could. ""It's not a foregone conclusion, in my professional military estimate, that the Taliban automatically win and Kabul falls, or any of those kind of dire predictions,"" Milley said during a news briefing at the time. ""There's a significant military capability in the Afghan government, and we have to see how this plays out."" Afghanistan fell swiftly to the Taliban after the U.S. military shuttered Bagram Air Base. Milley, along with Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Secretary of State Antony Blinken, was among the Biden administration leaders who green-lit that plan. They are now helping direct the U.S. response to Russia's aggression in Ukraine. The fighting between both sides has moved closer to Kyiv as civilians continue to be targeted by Russian shelling. On Monday, Ukrainian officials claimed to have downed two Russian aircraft over the area and Russian artillery units have shelled the outer portions of the city. From a manpower standpoint, Russia has sent nearly 100% of its combat forces into Ukraine, Defense Department officials said Monday. This is an unusual move: Armed forces tend to keep numbers in reserve outside the theater of combat. In addition, Moscow was recruiting Syrian fighters to back up the Russian army as the Kremlin struggled to contain its losses, along with global condemnation over the invasion and political and economic isolation. Moscow has already reportedly sent Chechen forces to hunt down Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, and those forces have reportedly been eliminated by the Ukrainians. Pete Marocco, former deputy assistant Secretary of State for conflict and stabilization operations, told Fox News that predictions about whether Kyiv would fall to Russian troops came before the Beijing Winter Olympics in February. A woman and her child sit on the pavement in a subway station turned into a shelter in Kyiv, Ukraine, on Tuesday. ""I’m not sure it was an intelligence failure. I don’t know that it was an inaccurate statement to say that it could have fallen within 72 hours,"" he said. ""As time languished on, Ukraine became prepared."" He noted that such dire warnings could possibly be messaged with the intent of spurring one’s allies to make necessary preparations or possibly overcompensating for the miscalculations in Afghanistan. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine came days after the end of the Winter Games, a misstep on Putin’s part, said Marocco. The reason why he waited to begin military operations is left to speculation, he said. Anti-tank constructions are seen in central Kyiv, Ukraine, on Monday. ""I don’t see him as having that sort of sensitivity or caring unless there might have been some sort of tactic or mutual agreement with China,"" Marocco said. ""If he did that, that would be a surprising strategic blunder on his part. I tend to think that there’s another explanation behind the scenes as to why there was this lull before the start. Perhaps to allow predictable sanctions targets enough time to move assets before U.S. sanctions would be put in place."" As the war rages, intelligence warnings of the downfall of Kyiv are irrelevant, said Daniel Hoffman, a retired Senior Clandestine Services Officer. He added that intelligence doesn't make predictions. ""The Russian logistics suck. The supply chain sucks. Zelenskyy has been a hero. Ukrainians have stepped up to fight,"" he told Fox News. ""It's always on a spectrum. You ask some analyst and they would have said: ‘I have a low medium or high level of confidence that the fight could last this long or that long.’"" ""I'm not even sure it's an issue,"" he added. ""It's over. It doesn't matter. The fight's on.""",14,3.5976362082488595,4.094627637079872,-0.4969914288310129,11

The Pentagon on Friday warned that Russian troops are starting to make greater advances toward the capital city of Kyiv as Ukrainian forces continue to fight back against a barrage of missile fire.

""And we do assess that the Russians are beginning to make more momentum on the ground towards Kyiv, particularly from the East."" Troops and military vehicles deployed in Ozera, northeast of Antonov Airport ‘’ : The news comes as defense officials have been sounding the alarm for weeks that Russian President Vladimir Putin may attempt to encircle the city to overthrow the democratically elected government and install a ""puppet regime"" of its own. Convoys headed for the city have been unable to make major advances since the fighting began over two weeks ago, but the tide could be changing for Russian forces. A Russian convoy north of Kyiv has yet to advance and recent satellite imagery has suggested it has moved off into the tree line. But Kirby prefaced this by saying he did not want to draw too much from the dispersing Russian troops in the north and said, ""That could just be forced protection because the Ukrainians have continued to threaten that convoy and its progress."" Forces northwest of the city remain a threat to Kyiv, but according to a senior defense official Friday, they are still roughly 10 miles outside the city. Putin has deployed roughly all the 150,000 troops he amassed on Ukraine’s border in the lead-up to the invasion and despite the loss of at least 700 Russian military vehicles Moscow has maintained about 90% of its combat force. Members of the Ukrainian military arrive to reinforce a forward position on the eastern frontline near Kalynivka village on March 08, 2022, in Kyiv, Ukraine. : 2.5 Ukraine has also maintained roughly 90% of its fighting forces despite the nearly 810 missiles fired upon it over the last 16 days. Half of the missiles levied at Ukrainian forces have come from Russian troops within Ukraine. Just under half of the missiles have been fired from Russia and roughly 80 have been launched from Belarus, a senior defense official confirmed. Russia has largely focused its invasion in the North, South and Eastern regions of Ukraine. But two cities in Western Ukraine fell victim to Russia’s missile launches Friday. ""Our assessment is that they struck a couple of airfields in the West,"" Kirby told reporters. ""It's not like there hasn't been any airstrikes in Western Ukraine since the beginning of this operation 16 days ago. It's just that we haven't seen that as a routine,"" he added, noting the significance of two strikes in one day.

""It's really bad that Ukraine can't put all the people who want to fight to the front lines,"" Savchuk told Fox News Digital from the Ukraine capital on Thursday, with fighting happening mere miles away. ""It means we are not realizing our full potential … Currently, we have much more men willing to fight than we can put on the front line.""

Today, he's speaking with international news outlets about Ukraine's need for more anti-aircraft missiles to shoot down Russian planes. : The is also trying to convey the ""voice of the Ukrainian people"" to the west, Savchuk said.

People walk along a road by a forest, as they flee Russia's invasion of Ukraine, in the Vyshgorod region near Kyiv, Ukraine March 10, 2022.

Much of the civilized world has rallied to Ukraine's cause, with Russia isolating itself further by the day. Its bombing of a maternity and children's hospital in Mariupol this week further stoked global outrage.

David Bellavia says urban warfare ‘does not make sense on a tactical level’ for Russia. An Army veteran who was awarded the Medal of Honor for his heroism in Iraq broke down Thursday on ""Fox & Friends"" why urban warfare will be difficult in Russia’s invasion into Ukraine. Retired Army Staff Sgt. David Bellavia said the invasion has not gone well for Vladimir Putin so far and may get worse as the fighting moves to more urban areas. ""This is a humiliation. This is allegedly a world power that has top five military in the world. And look, for the outnumbered aspect that Russia has with material, technology and true power, why you would want to then take that into a house-to-house situation where it nullifies all that technology?"" he told host Brian Kilmeade Bellavia said ""home-field advantage is going to go to the defender"" as this war goes on. ""You put a machine gun behind the door, I don’t care if you are Team 6 or Marvel ‘Avengers,' you are going to get shot. To me, it makes no sense from a tactical level why Putin would want to attempt this."" ' ': '' Ukrainian soldiers take positions outside a military facility as two cars burn, in a street in Kyiv, Ukraine, Saturday, Feb. 26, 2022. Russian troops stormed toward Ukraine's capital Saturday, and street fighting broke out as city officials urged residents to take shelter. Bellavia explained further why combat in a ""house-to-house situation"" does not work on a tactical level for Russia. ""Just thinking about your own home, right? You know where everything is. You have lived there for years,"" he said, adding that type of warfare takes a psychological toll on soldiers who don't know where the opposing forces are located. ""It’s physically exhausting. Emotionally and spiritually exhausting. And dangerous as all get out. You don’t have to be skilled to shoot at someone going through a door,"" said Bellavia, who received the Medal of Honor from President Trump for his actions to save his fellow soldiers in Fallujah, Iraq. He said the amount of Ukrainians fighting for the love of their country should ""scare the hell out of Putin."" Even while 1.5 million Ukrainians have fled the country amid the Russian invasion in the past two weeks, more than 100,000 Ukrainians and others have flocked to Ukraine in order to fight Putin's forces, according to Ukraine Defense Minister Oleksiy Reznikov. Ukrainians on the ground tell Fox News Digital that volunteers have been turned away from the army because it lacks weapons. ""More than 140,000 Ukrainians, mostly men, have returned from Europe,"" Reznikov wrote in a Facebook post Monday. ""Tens of thousands joined the Territorial Defense Forces.

David Bellavia breaks down the Russia-Ukraine war. Thursday’s high-level talks in Turkey between Ukrainian and Russian foreign affairs counterparts ended in no progress for a potential cease-fire or for protecting civilians in the heavily bombarded Mariupol, even after Ukraine suggested a ""neutrality"" proposal with security guarantees from world powers. In the most senior interaction since Russian President Vladimir Putin launched the invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, the failed talks between Ukraine Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba and his counterpart, Russia's Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, lasted just 90 minutes in the Turkish coastal city of Antalya. Russia reportedly rejected Ukraine’s ""neutrality"" proposals that promised international security guarantees, according to the Financial Times. The two sides discussed a 24-hour cease-fire but did not make progress, as Russia was still seeking ""surrender from Ukraine,"" Kuleba said. , ‘’ : ""This is not what they are going to get,"" he said, adding that he was willing to continue the dialogue. After Russians bombed a maternity and children’s hospital in the Ukrainian port city of Mariupol the day before, Lavrov rejected what he categorized as the ""shouting"" over the ""so-called atrocities,"" repeating Russian claims without evidence that the hospital was captured by Ukrainian far-right ""ultra-radicals."" He also dismissed concerns about civilian casualties as ""pathetic shrieks"" from Russia’s enemies. In response, Kuleba asserted that the leadership in Moscow ""live in their own reality."" Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba speaks to journalists following a tripartite meeting with Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu and Russia's Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, in Antalya, Turkey, Thursday, March 10, 2022. ""Unfortunately, I can confirm that the Russian leadership, including Minister Lavrov, live in their own reality,"" Kuleba told on Thursday. ""In our talks, behind closed doors and in the absence of the media, he told me looking in my eyes that the pictures of pregnant women being taken from under the rubble of the maternity house are fake, that they hit the maternity house as a military target because the Russian military was absolutely sure that it was under the control of Ukrainian army."" Kuleba said he came the talks with a ""humanitarian"" purpose to establish evacuation corridors for civilians looking to flee the devastation in Mariupol, which has been encircled by Russian forces for days. ""Unfortunately, Minister Lavrov was not in position to commit himself to it, but he will correspond with respective authorities,"" he said. In Mariupol, hundreds have died, and workers hurried to bury some of the bodies in a mass grave. Those who have survived have been breaking into shops for food and resorting to melting snow for drinking water, as Ukrainian officials said Russian forces have blocked a convoy with food and medicine. Lavrov claimed that Russia ""did not attack Ukraine,"" the Financial Times reported, and that everything was ""going according to plan"" regarding Russia’s military operation in the country. He also repeated unsubstantiated allegations that Ukraine was creating bioweapons at its border with help from the U.S., claims which the White House said are ""preposterous."" The White House warned Wednesday that such claims could be used by the Kremlin as a ""false flag."" , : 'S , ‘’ ""We just explained to Ukraine many times that a situation had arisen which posed a direct threat to Russia,"" he said, according to the Financial Times. ""Despite the fact that we talked about this over many years -- no one listened to our appeals and exhortations."" Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov speaks to the media in Antalya, Turkey, Thursday, March 10, 2022. Lavrov also said Russia was ready for more negotiations but showed no sign of softening Moscow’s demands. He said Putin could meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy but only after further negotiations about Russia’s broader grievances. Zelenskyy has said Russia’s attack on Mariupol’s hospital equated to a ""war crime."" Ukrainian authorities said a child was among those dead in Wednesday's attack in Mariupol. Another 17 people were wounded, including women waiting to give birth, and doctors and children were buried in the rubble. Images of pregnant women covered in dust and blood dominated news reports in many countries and brought a new wave of horror at the 2-week-old war sparked by Russia's invasion, which has killed thousands of soldiers and civilians and driven more than 2 million people from Ukraine. Millions more have been displaced inside Ukraine. Kyiv mayor Vitali Klitschko said Thursday that about 2 million people — half the residents of the capital's metropolitan area — have left the city. Britain’s Armed Forces minister, James Heappey, said that whether hitting the hospital was ""indiscriminate"" fire into a built-up area or a deliberate targeting, ""it is a war crime.""

Polish President Andrzej Duda called the strike on the hospital an ""act of barbarity"" and said ""it is obvious to us that in Ukraine Russians are committing war crimes."" French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz called for an ""immediate cease-fire"" in a phone call with Putin on Thursday. Russia has alleged that western-looking, U.S.-backed Ukraine posed a threat to its security — but Western officials suspect Putin would like to install a government friendly to Moscow in Kyiv as part of efforts to draw the ex-Soviet state back into its orbit. Russia’s military is currently struggling, facing stronger than expected Ukrainian resistance and heavier losses of its own troops. But Putin’s invading force of more than 150,000 troops retains possibly insurmountable advantages in firepower as it bears down on key cities.

2022-03-10,Fox,https://www.foxnews.com/world/russian-struggle-ukraine-military-overestimated,Russian struggle in Ukraine poses question of whether military was overestimated,"National security correspondent discusses alternative actions that could strengthen Ukraine on 'Special Report.' As Russia continues its assault on Ukraine and its major cities amid its chaotic military campaign, the struggles Moscow has faced in attempting to make progress have surprised some experts who predicted Kyiv would fall within a matter of days. Two weeks into Russian President Vladimir Putin's invasion, his forces have been met with a determined and unexpected Ukrainian resistance that has refused to roll over, evident of the Kremlin's inability to establish air supremacy, despite a constant barrage of airstrikes. Its ability to over-perform against a larger and better equipped Russian military is in contrast to what many predicted. Russia outnumbers Ukraine in weapons, troops and has a history of deploying its military to fight in a number of conflicts. Despite this, Ukrainian fighters have been able to launch counterattacks with regularity. : ‘’ A destroyed Russian tank is seen after battles on a main road near Brovary, north of Kyiv, Ukraine on Thursday. Russia was expected to overtake Ukrainian forces within a matter of days but has so far met stiff resistance. Partly to blame is Russia's ineffective planning to coordinate logistics and sustainment efforts and poor leadership, experts said. ""A lot of their problems are logistical and tactical in nature,"" retired Green Beret, George Fraser, told Fox News. ""It’s not that they have bad tanks or faulty bullets as much as a terrible logistics training and lack training or experience in executing battle tactics."" Unlike the Ukrainians, who are fighting for their nation's survival, Russian troops are risking their lives while the world continues to condemn their presence in a neighboring country without provocation. Experts initially believed Russia's ground combat forces would overwhelm Ukrainian fighters. However, its combined arms tactics – the integration of combat arms, infantry, armor and aircraft, working together – has left much to be desired, Fraser said. As the conflict continues to escalate, images and videos posted to social media have given the world a glimpse into what's happening. Many show successful attacks on the ground and air against Russian troops while others have captured abandoned enemy vehicles with depleted tires and equipment. Armored vehicles have so far failed to march into Kyiv, the capital, and Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, which sits a few miles from the border with Russia. A stalled military column of tanks and heavy weaponry spanning 40 miles long that was already moving at a snail's pace has halted its advance just a few miles from the capital. The stoppage has baffled military analysts. A satellite image shows a military convoy near Invankiv, Ukraine February 28, 2022. Satellite image 2022 Moscow's military strategy contrasts with its 2014 annexation of the Crimean Peninsula from Ukraine, Liam Collins, a retired Army Special Forces officer who served as a defense advisor to Ukraine from 2016-18, told Fox News. ""Russia has definitely underperformed, but I don't think it's an indictment on their entire military or that we overestimated,"" said Collins, the founding director of the Modern War Institute. ""In 2014, they seemed to have a war plan for Crimea that they dusted off the shelf and executed to perfection and this time they had months buildup and appeared to have no war plan at all."" Ukraine's stiff resistance is the result of a number of factors, he said, including its 2016 effort to reform its military and millions of dollars in aid and military equipment. Another is the culture of military volunteerism among Ukrainians, as many have decided against fleeing to fight, be it with firearms or Molotov cocktails. Amid its military struggles, Moscow has stepped up attacks on civilian targets, and in the process upending evacuation efforts. ""The Kremlin is bombing schools and hospitals, including maternity hospitals. Moscow does not protect anyone. It destroys,"" Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksiy Reznikov said Thursday. In Mariupol, in Ukraine's east, strikes targeted a maternity ward, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said Wednesday. ""People, children are under the wreckage. Atrocity!"" he tweeted while also asking for a no-fly zone to be established over Ukrainian skies. ""How much longer will the world be an accomplice ignoring terror?"" Despite the missteps, Fraser warned that Russia still has many troops and that it was too early to dismiss their resolve in trying to conquer Ukraine. ""Their performance could lead you to say that you miscalculated how good the Russian army is, but I’d be cautious in that assessment as they have many units left in Russia that may be of higher caliber in reserve for the possibility of a confrontation with were it to happen; but there a lot of things about how they are executing in Ukraine that are not adding up,"" he said. ""I think it’s just miscalculations on everybody’s part about everything,"" he added. ""I don’t know anybody that’s got any prediction right about how this war has played out.""",14,3.3750744735098266,3.3553438231281114,0.019730650381715176,10

The allegations come two weeks into Vladimir Putin's invasion of his smaller neighbor. ""According to data released by the , it has 26 bio-labs and other related facilities in Ukraine, over which the Department of Defense has absolute control,"" Zhao Lijian, a spokesperson for China’s Foreign Ministry, said during a news conference Tuesday. ""All dangerous pathogens in Ukraine must be stored in these labs and all research activities are led by the side. Without approval, no information shall be released to the public."" Zhao was echoing claims from his Russian counterpart Maria Vladimirovna Zakharova, who said Kremlin troops found evidence that Ukrainians are covering up evidence of ""military biological programs"" in fear that the invading army will learn more. U.S. officials have said the idea is ""absurd"" and that Russia could be using it as cover ahead of a possible chemical or biological attack on Ukraine. China has also struggled to fend off concerns that the -19 pandemic may have originated in a lab in its city of Wuhan. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian speaks at a news conference in Beijing, China April 8, 2020.

""Now that Russia has made these false claims, and China has seemingly endorsed this propaganda, we should all be on the lookout for Russia to possibly use chemical or biological weapons in Ukraine, or to create a false flag operation using them,"" she said. ""It’s a clear pattern, and no one should fall for it."" Following the collapse of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s, the U.S. has led an international effort to secure and dismantle leftover Soviet-era weapons of mass destruction, including in Ukraine. In August 2005, Washington and Kyiv agreed to cooperate to prevent the ""proliferation of technology, pathogens and expertise that could be used in the development of biological weapons."" 05 829 Ukraine Weapons by Fox News on Scribd The agreement required Ukraine to ""consolidate and store"" any dangerous pathogens it possessed in centralized facilities and required the country’s Ministry of Health to inform the if it had to move them temporarily ""due to emergency situations.""

As early as May 2020, Ukrainian officials called reports of American military biolabs within their borders ""fake news,"" the Kyiv Post reported at the time. Russia, on the other hand, has a history of violating international laws governing biological and chemical weapons, Psaki said – citing the attempted poisoning of Kremlin critic Alexey Navalny and Russia’s support of Bashar al-Assad in Syria, who has used chemical weapons to quell domestic rebellions. Still, Zhao accused the U.S. of ""stonewalling"" and dismissing China and Russia’s claims as ""spreading disinformation."" ""It’s exactly the kind of disinformation operation we’ve seen repeatedly from the Russians over the years in Ukraine and in other countries around the world, which have been debunked conclusively, and an example of the types of false pretexts we have been warning the Russians would invent,"" she said. ""The United States is in full compliance with its obligations under the Chemical Weapons Convention and the Biological Weapons Convention and does not develop or possess such weapons anywhere."" - Pentagon press secretary John Kirby also addressed the claims Wednesday, saying they were ""malarkey"" and ""classic Russian propaganda."" ""We are not developing biological or chemical weapons inside Ukraine,"" he said. ""It's not happening."" However, the claims generated renewed interest Tuesday when Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs Victoria Nuland told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that the U.S. was concerned about Russian troops seizing ""biological research facilities"" in Ukraine. : ‘ F------ !’ Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Florida, had asked her if Ukraine has chemical or biological weapons. ""Ukraine has biological research facilities,"" Nuland replied, ""which in fact we are quite concerned Russian troops, Russian forces, may be seeking to gain control of, so we are working with the Ukrainians on how they can prevent any of those research materials from falling into the hands of Russian forces."" Rubio then asked whether Nuland believed Ukraine would conduct a biological attack within its own borders. ""I’m sure you’re aware that the Russian propaganda groups [are] already putting out there all kinds of information about how they’ve uncovered a plot by the Ukrainians to release biological weapons in the country, with ’s coordination,"" Rubio said. ""If there is a biological or chemical weapon incident or attack inside of Ukraine, is there any doubt in your mind that 100% it would be the Russians that would be behind it?""

However, as more and more countries step up in defense of Ukraine, many fear this means impending retaliation. ‘ ’ Russia – which, according to cybersecurity strategist Danielle Jablanski, is capable of ""the most sophisticated"" cyber attacks – has previously demonstrated its dark capabilities on several occasions. Just weeks before the Russian invasion of Ukraine, 70 government websites were targeted with threatening messages to expect worse. In 2015, Ukraine’s power grid was hit, leaving 230,000 residents without electricity. The hacker was able to gain remote control of the systems, effectively locking out the operator to shut off the power. In another instance, malware spread to millions of computers worldwide after it was ""detonated on Ukraine’s financial sector,"" leading to $10 billion in damages. Recently, Microsoft ""detected wiper malware aimed at Ukraine's government, ministries, and financial institutions,"" O’Grady explained. The company’s detection systems identified the malware and updated to block the infected code, which was later shared with surrounding countries out of caution. ""Without defending against malware like wiper, what we would see is computers we use every day not be accessible, servers that we rely on to provide transactions, or banking, or news information not be available,"" cybersecurity expert Christian Sorensen explained. While no threat of a cyber attack has yet been made against the United States, experts warn to be prepared. ""I think Vladimir Putin is already looking at, hey, how do we retaliate against the United States in the West?"" David Kennedy, cybersecurity expert and former hacker, told Fox Nation. ""We should definitely be prepared both on a critical infrastructure and financials, which are the two main areas that I think will be the first targets of us back here in the United States."" The U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s cybersecurity division has previously responded to incidents that have impacted government agencies, infrastructure, and private sector organizations. ""These hackers, later identified as members of the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service, used privileged access to collect and withdraw sensitive data, and even created backdoors to enable their return,"" O’Grady reported. Russia is capable of disabling or even destroying U.S. satellites, according to cyber experts. This would affect Americans by impacting farming automation, navigation, and oil exploration. Though Russia has capabilities against America, the U.S. is also able to launch attacks of its own. In fact, experts admit they don’t believe Russia would risk engaging the U.S. in a cyber rwar. ""Whether Russia will engage in full-scale cyber warfare against Ukraine and its allies remains to be seen,"" O’Grady reflected. ""In modern warfare, all things are possible. One thing is certain: Russia is a cyber threat.""

Russell said she was ""horrified"" by the reported attack on a maternity hospital in Mariupol, Ukraine, on Wednesday that wounded more than a dozen people, including women near childbirth, Ukrainian officials said, according to the Associated Press. : On March 1 2022, a family travels with small children to the Lviv-Holovnyi railway station in Lviv, Ukraine as the Russia-Ukraine war continues. ""I am horrified by the reported attack today on a maternity hospital in Mariupol, Ukraine – an attack which reportedly left young children and women in labor buried beneath the rubble of destroyed buildings,"" Russell said. Catherine Russell C front, head of the Children's Fund, speaks during the Security Council meeting on Ukraine at the headquarters in New York, March 7, 2022. ) ""This attack, if confirmed, underscores the horrific toll this war is exacting on Ukraine’s children and families,"" she added. ""In less than two weeks, at least 37 children have been killed and 50 injured, while more than 1 million children have fled Ukraine to neighboring countries."" Attacks from Russian forces on residential buildings and hospitals have forced families and medical patients, including expectant mothers, to take shelter underground and receive medical services in makeshift shelters. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy shared video of what he described as the ""direct strike of Russian troops"" on the maternity hospital in Mariupol. He once again demanded the skies be closed over Ukraine. ""People, children are under the wreckage. Atrocity!"" Zelenskyy tweeted. ""How much longer will the world be an accomplice ignoring terror? Close the sky right now! Stop the killings! You have power but you seem to be losing humanity."" More than 2 million people have fled Ukraine since Putin approved a ""special military operation"" in the country last month, according to a tracker from the United Nations refugee agency. Reuters reported that those who fled are mostly women and children because the Kyiv government has ordered able-bodied men to stay in the country and fight. But many of the children fleeing are either unaccompanied or have been separated from their parents or family members, says. The agency warned that children without parental care are at a ""heightened risk of violence, abuse, and exploitation."" : 100K ""When these children are moved across borders, the risks are multiplied. The risk of trafficking also soars in emergencies,"" added. Russell noted that the children of Ukraine ""desperately need peace.""",17,4.502355184528362,3.5735334035915676,0.9288217809367945,12

Mariupol, which sits on the Azov Sea, has been surrounded by Russian soldiers for days. Sharing disturbing photos on Wednesday showing dead bodies strewn across badly bombed out city blocks, Emine Dzheppar, First Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine, said Mariupol is ""besieged"" by Russia invaders who keep shelling and killing the civilian population of the city.

An attempt to evacuate civilians and deliver badly needed food, water and medicine through a designated safe corridor failed on Tuesday, with Ukrainian officials saying Russian forces had fired on the convoy before it reached the city. The Russian military has denied firing on convoys and charged that the Ukrainian side is blocking evacuation efforts. 'S , Natalia Mudrenko, the highest-ranking woman at Ukraine’s U.N.

For days, as Moscow’s forces have laid siege to Ukrainian cities, attempts to create corridors to safely evacuate civilians have stumbled amid continuing fighting and objections to the proposed routes. Ukraine has rejected Moscow’s offers of corridors that lead civilians to Russia or its ally Belarus. Mariupol, said Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk, is in a ""catastrophic situation."" One evacuation did appear successful Tuesday, with Vereshchuk saying that 5,000 civilians, including 1,700 foreign students, had been brought out via a safe corridor from Sumy, an embattled northeastern city of a quarter-million people where overnight strikes killed 21, including two children.

Maria Vladimirovna Zakharova, director of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs’ information and press department, said that in the course of their invasion of Ukraine, Russia confirmed that Ukrainian leadership was trying to quickly clean up any trace of ""military and biological programs"" that Ukraine was conducting with financial backing from the U.S. - : , 'S This echoed previous accusations that the Kremlin has made about Ukraine allegedly destroying samples of various pathogens.

This is not the first time that Russia has accused the U.S. of backing biological weapons labs near its borders. In 2018, the Kremlin alleged that the U.S. was funding a secret biological weapons lab in the country of Georgia, which they claimed was one of several labs the U.S. had near the borders of Russia and China.

Russia’s Vladimir Putin sought to assuage the concerns of his country’s military moms Tuesday, 12 days into his invasion of Ukraine, while doubling down on the claim that his full-scale attack is a defensive move. ""I’d like to address the mothers, wives, sisters, brides and girlfriends of our soldiers and officers who are in battle now,"" he said in a televised address, according to a translation from Russian. ""I know how worried you are for your loved ones,"" he continued. ""You can be proud of them just as the whole country is proud and feels for them."" His speech came a day after a group of mothers accused the Russian military of using their sons as ""cannon fodder"" in the war with Ukraine. Vladimir President Vladimir Putin ordered Russia’s all-out invasion of Ukraine only eight months after magazine billed President Biden as ready to take on the Russian leader. : ""We were all deceived, all deceived,"" a woman shouted at Sergey Tsivilev, governor of the Kuzbass region in Siberia, on a video translated by the Telegraph and shared to social media. ""They were sent there as cannon fodder. They are young. They were unprepared."" Putin claimed Russian troops, which he sent in last month in a stalled bid to topple the government in Kyiv, have deployed for a defensive ""special military operation."" He also claimed that ""conscripted soldiers"" played no role in combat operations in Ukraine and vowed not to mobilize additional reserves. However, just days into the invasion last month reports emerged that conscripted soldiers had been forced to sign military contracts and were cut off from communications with their families. Just days into the invasion last month reports emerged that conscripted soldiers had been forced to sign military contracts and were cut off from communications with their families. ) : ‘ F------ !’ Olga Larkina, the director of Russia’s Committee of Soldiers’ Mothers, spoke to Russian investigative news outlet Meduza, describing how Russian conscripts – those fulfilling military enlistment requirements – had been pressured, or at times even forced to sign contracts to become soldiers for the Russian military. ""Mothers are telling us that their sons have been calling them and saying they’re being forced to sign contracts. We believe it’s wrong to force a conscript to become a contract soldier,"" Larkina said, according to the translated article. ""The parents who have gotten in touch have told us their sons were just taken by military officers, stamped, and that’s it — now they’re contract soldiers."" Putin disputed those characterizations Tuesday.

""Russian mothers are losing their children in a completely foreign country,"" Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in a video. ""Think of this number: almost 6,000 Russians died, Russian military, in six days of war."" Separately, Ukraine’s Defense Ministry claimed it would return Russian prisoners if their mothers came to pick them up in the country’s besieged capital, Kyiv. The number of Russian dead is disputed. U.S. officials said Tuesday it may be around 3,000, while Ukraine says it’s about four times that amount. The Kremlin said about 500 troops died as of last week.

In a congressional hearing, lawmakers heard from analysts and foreign policy advisers on how Russian should be held accountable for its deadly invasion into Ukraine. Civilians continue to flee from Irpin due to ongoing Russian attacks in Irpin, Ukraine on March 8, 2022. : ""If we do nothing, then we will surely see other aggression perpetrated by China, North Korea, among others,"" David Crane, founding chief prosecutor for the U.N. Special Court for Sierra Leone said. ""We have to show tyrants around the world that the rule of law is more powerful than the rule of the gun."" The international prosecutor's comments come as concerns have mounted that China could be looking to see how the international community may react if it decides to invade Taiwan. Crane argued the U.S. needs to act as a leader in the global sphere and hold Russian President Vladimir Putin accountable. He pointed to various paths the international community could take, including through the establishment of war tribunals similar to those that followed . ""It must be noted that the United States has led the creation of all of the international tribunals and courts in the modern era — from Nuremberg and Tokyo, the former Yugoslavia, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, the International Criminal Court and various domestic efforts and mechanisms around the world as well,"" Crane said. ""The United States must continue to show leadership in the creation of justice mechanisms to hold Vladimir Putin and his henchmen accountable."" Crane was joined by former Deputy to the Ambassador-at-Large for Global Criminal Justice, Jane Stromseth, and Managing Director of Global Policy at the George W. Bush Institute, David Kramer, who also gave similar testimony.

New Jersey Republican Rep. Chris Smith, who co-chaired the event with Massachusetts Democrat Rep.

A service takes place at Lychakiv cemetery during a joint funeral for two soldiers who died in the east of the country during recent fighting, on March 8, 2022 in Lviv, Ukraine. The mechanism would largely reflect what Crane referred to in his calls for an international tribunal to investigate and prosecute Putin for his violation of Ukraine’s sovereignty. ""The refrain never again emerged in the wake of the Holocaust, and Ukrainians are wondering whether that pledge applies to them. Ukrainians are courageously defending their country in their freedom,"" Kramer told the lawmakers. ""But they need more help from the international community.""",13,4.481666672112442,4.864626237149897,-0.38295956503745554,1

The International Criminal Court opened an investigation into possible war crimes after Russian President Vladimir Putin approved a ""special military operation"" in Ukraine Feb. 24, a somber reminder of the number of war crimes committed over the last century. The United Nations says that war crimes must occur during an armed conflict, and examples may include murder, cruel treatment and torture, taking of hostages, intentionally directing attacks against the civilian population, and more. One expert previously told Fox News Digital that the will investigate potential war crimes committed by individuals. ""With respect to the situation in Ukraine, the prosecutor may investigate allegations of war crimes, crimes against humanity and the crime of genocide,"" Dustin Lewis, research director at the Harvard Law School Program on International Law and Armed Conflict, said. : Russian President Vladimir Putin attends a meeting with Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu at the Kremlin, in Moscow on February 14, 2022. ) ""The is empowered to exercise jurisdiction only over natural persons. In other words, it may institute proceedings only against individual humans. The has no jurisdiction over the entities with which those humans may be affiliated, such as a government or a military,"" he added. Here's a look at some war crimes of the past century: Armenian Genocide From 1915 to 1916, hundreds of thousands of Armenians died after the Ottoman Turks began mass deportations from eastern Anatolia, which resulted in mass numbers of people dying from starvation or disease, according to the . Before beginning the mass deportations, the Young Turk regime hanged hundreds of Armenians in the streets of Istanbul, according to Yale University. The International Association of Genocide Scholars estimates that the number of deaths were ""more than a million,"" but that number is disputed. Armenians claim that the number of deaths is 1.5 million, while the Republic of Turkey says that it's 300,000. Multiple senior Ottoman officials were tried in connection with the genocide. For example, Mehmed Kemal, a local governor, was found guilty at the trial and was hanged for his involvement in the mass killing of Armenians, according to the report. While Turkey doesn't deny the staggering number of Armenian deaths, its government says that the ""Armenian deaths do not constitute genocide,"" according to Radio Free Europe. People lay flowers at the Armenian Genocide Memorial Complex on Tsitsernakaberd Hill on Armenian Genocide Remembrance Day, which commemorates to commemorate the victims of the Armenian Genocide in the Ottoman Empire. German War Crimes during World War While many war crimes were committed during World War , the most heinous was the Holocaust, when the Nazi German regime killed six million European Jews. Nazi leader Adolf Hitler considered the Jews an inferior race who were a threat to German racial purity, and enacted laws that targeted Jews, excluding them from German society, according to the United States Holocaust Museum. In September 1941, every person designated as a Jew in Nazi Germany was required to wear a yellow star, which made them a target, according to History.com. Between 1941 and 1945, during World War , Nazi Germany began the Holocaust death camps, where six million Jews were killed. Officials in Germany transported Jews to these death camps, where they were deprived of food, water, bathrooms, heat, and medical care, according to the United States Holocaust Museum. It wasn't until May 1945 when the Holocaust came to an end, when the Allied Powers began to overrun concentration camps and then liberate those who had survived, according to the museum. Algerian War The Algerian National Liberation Front fought France between 1954 and 1962 in the Algerian War, and historians estimate that around 250,000 to 300,000 Algerians died during the war, the University of North Carolina says. In 1954, the National Liberation Front launched a number of armed revolts throughout the country and demanded that the nation be declared independent, and France sent troops to the country to monitor the situation, according to the Atlantic. By August 1945, the National Liberation Front targeted civilians and incited a mob that killed more than 120 people, according to the report. In response, French troops and ""vigilante committees"" killed between 1,200 and 12,000 Muslims. After years of battles and hundreds of thousands of civilians killed, the French declared a ceasefire and the Algerian people voted to become independent of France in 1962. One French officer, Paul Aussaresses, admitted to torturing as well as killing Algerian prisoners of war, according to the . A French court convicted Aussaresses of defending the usage of torture in 2002. The post-war amnesty prevented Aussaresses and others from being tried for war crimes, according to the . Russo-Georgian War The Russo-Georgian war began on August 8, 2008, when Russian forces moved into Georgia and began the first war in Europe of the 21st century, according to the Atlantic Council. During the conflict, which lasted five days, several hundred civilians and military members died, according to the Brookings Institute, but the fighting displaced between 100,000 and 200,000 individuals. The International Criminal Court opened an investigation into war crimes committed during the war, but has faced several challenges. The European Court of Human Rights ruled in January 2021 that Russia was responsible for several human rights violations during the war, which includes murdering Georgian civilians, as well as looting and burning homes, according to the Guardian. A view of the Babyn Yar Holocaust Memorial Center in Kyiv on March 2, 2022. Wars between Russia and Chechnya After adopting a constitution that declared Chechnya independent in 1992, Russian troops entered the country in 1994 with the goal of taking down the independence movement, according to the . The war, which lasted 20 months, killed an estimated maximum of 100,000 people. It lasted from 1994 to 1996. The second war between Russia and Chechnya began in the summer of 1999, as Chechen fighters battled with troops from Russia on the border of Chechnya-Dagestan, according to the . During that summer, the Chechen rebels battled in Dagestan in an attempt to create an Islamic state. The second war went from 1999 to 2000, with Russia declaring direct rule over the country. Human Rights Watch alleged that Russian forces committed ""grave abuses,"" which include war crimes, during the war. In a hearing before the U.S. Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, Peter Bouckaert, a researcher at Human Rights Watch, presented evidence of the war crimes. Bouckaert stated that Russian forces conducted a ""carpet-bombing campaign,"" which resulted in the ""vast majority"" of civilian deaths during the war. ""The Russian forces have used powerful surface-to-surface rockets on numerous occasions, causing death tolls in the hundreds in the Central Market bombing in Grozny and in many smaller towns and villages,"" Bouckaert said. He added that Russian forces turned much of Chechnya into a ""wasteland.""",13,5.480770291685473,5.112245092265574,0.36852519941989836,2

2022-03-07,Fox,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/putin-russia-geneva-conventions-ukraine-jonathan-turley,Putin's Russia lies about volunteers fighting for Ukraine,"Former Intelligence Officer Matthew Shoemaker and Fox News contributor Judy Miller weigh in on day 12 of the conflict. The gut-wrenching scenes from Ukraine have moved millions around the world to denounce the Russian invasion and support Ukrainian independence. For some, however, it is a literal call to duty. Thousands of former soldiers have traveled to Ukraine to defend its people. The numbers have clearly unnerved the Russians who have launched a global campaign to warn volunteers that they will be treated as mercenaries, not legitimate prisoners of war if captured. - , ‘’ Russian President Vladimir Putin speaks to representatives of the flight crew of Russian airlines as he visits to Aeroflot Aviation School outside Moscow, Russia, Saturday, March 5, 2022. Among the large number of such volunteers drawn to Ukraine’s defense are many Americans. They are in a modern version of the Lincoln Brigade that fought against fascism in Spain before World War . The similarities to the Spanish Civil War are striking with the fascists controlling the skies, fielding advanced weaponry, and engaging in war crimes. Back then, Russia supported the Republican forces against fascism. Now, however, Russia is declaring that foreign volunteers are not considered covered ""combatants"" under the Geneva Conventions. That is not true. Russian embassies are putting out statements telling men not to join the fight at the risk of being classified ""mercenaries."" The Russians are warning that the ""best case scenario"" is that foreign volunteers will be tried and punished as criminals, including the risk of executions. Of course, Russia has little credibility on any interpretation of international law today. There is growing evidence of possible war crimes by Russia, including attacking civilian areas with indiscriminate weapons and using prohibited weapons. Moreover, Russia is using mercenaries like the infamous Wagner group. Putting aside the hypocrisy, the Russian government is legally wrong. Under the Geneva Conventions, ""the best case scenario"" is not ""detention and prosecution."" The Ukrainian president and government has officially called on international volunteers to join the Ukrainian military. They are a part of the Ukrainian defense forces and given Ukrainian training, uniforms, and insignia. The Russian position is akin to saying that the French Foreign Legion would be treated as mercenaries because it includes non-French volunteers. The Legion famously opens its ranks to ""recruits from all over the world."" Likewise, the estimated 16,000 foreign fighters are being organized under the ""Ukrainian Foreign Legion"" and requires a commitment of a year or longer of service. While there are areas of ambiguity over private contractors and other participants in conflicts, the current definitions of covered combatants clearly and unambiguously reject the Russian position. Article 4 includes ""Members of the armed forces of a Party to the conflict as well as members of militias or volunteer corps performing part of such armed forces."" Thus, both militias and volunteer corps are included. Article 4 also makes clear that ""Militias and members of other volunteer corps … belonging to a Party to the conflict and operating in or outside their own territory"" enjoy combatant status and protections. Under the Geneva Conventions and the Additional Protocols, there is a division drawn between combatants and civilians. The later term can include unlawful combatants, spies, and mercenaries. Moreover, Article 45 addressed the ""Protection of persons who have taken part in hostilities"" and affirms that every combatant who is captured shall be presumed to be a prisoner of war. Accordingly, if a foreign fighter is captured ""he shall continue to have such status and, therefore, to be protected by the Third Convention and this Protocol until such time as his status has been determined by a competent tribunal."" Conversely, mercenaries under Protocol I are defined as ""foreign combatants recruited to fight in one specific conflict and motivated by the desire for private gain in an amount in excess of the payment to the armed forces of the recruiting state."" That is not the case in Ukraine. Ironically, the Russians have long embraced such international volunteers in combat operations. One of the largest such efforts was the Soviet Volunteer Group that went, with government support, to China to fight in the Second Sino-Japanese War between 1937 and 1941. These soldiers wore civilian clothes and traveled to China to become part of their military. That included hundreds of pilots and planes. The Russians also were foreign combatants in the Spanish Civil War. They were considered particularly key to the defense of Madrid against the fascists, including German forces. That included a force of T-26 tanks under the famed Captain Paul ""Greize"" Arman and Brigadier Dmitriy ""Pablo"" Pavlov. It also included dozens of Soviet I-15 fighters Tupolev -40 bombers. Under the current interpretation of Russia, all of these men would now be treated as criminal mercenaries. If Russia carries through on its interpretation of the Geneva Conventions to exclude foreign members of the Ukrainian defense force, it would be in flagrant violation of the Geneva Conventions. One could say that this hardly matters when the Russians are shattering international legal principles and committing atrocities in the invasion. However, the violation of the Geneva Conventions exposes military commanders to possible international charges and sanctions. The International Military Tribunal for the Far East involved the prosecution of officials responsible for the abuse of s. Article 86 of Protocol I was written in light of the World War cases. It imposes criminal liability on the commander if he knew or should have known that a subordinate was going to commit breaches of the conventions. The world legal community must speak with one voice in rejecting the interpretation put forward by Russia on the Geneva Conventions so there is no question about the knowledge of Russian commanders in committing such violations. When this war ends, there will hopefully be an accounting for those responsible. However, we must make that clear and unambiguous record now if we are going to later vindicate the rights of the victims of this invasion.",13,4.73315027179307,5.1283488372135935,-0.39519856542052345,2

Thomas Spoehr told Fox News Digital that while there is no specific organized crime ring in the military, it’s ""certain"" organized crime operates in the Russian military to some degree. ""We talk about how the U.S. military is a reflection of U.S. society, and we had this issue with gangs in the military not terribly long ago,"" Spoehr explained. ""By that same notion, it would be astonishing if there wasn’t organized crime in the Russian military because Russian society is rife with organized crime. It’s almost like another economy the way Russia operates."" He said the Russian military prioritizes its navy over its army, which may contribute to the poor rations and guns seen on social media. But he added that while the Russian military ostensibly acquires new weapons and equipment through its bureau of acquisitions, there is no doubt ""a certain amount of corruption."" - : ""There is graft, malfeasance, all those kinds of things,"" Spoehr said. ""So people are skimming off the top, maybe in some cases accepting shoddy goods, sometimes enriching themselves by directing contracts to their favorite oligarch – all that stuff happens."" But Spoehr stressed that strategic issues and logistical shortcomings are likely more responsible for Russia’s shocking performance in Ukraine than any possible corruption. Dan Hoffman, a Fox News contributor and former station chief in Moscow, argues that we can’t know to what degree corruption has impacted the Russian military – only that the troops are ""challenged"" and cannot say what the cause is. He argued it is just as likely that the planned revitalization of supplies and forces following the Georgia invasion in 2008 never took hold as it should have, or it could be that the military hadn’t tried to stage a full invasion since World War and wasn’t prepared for the realities of such an operation.",14,5.267107652330887,6.063186773442091,-0.7960791211112035,21

Gen. Don Bolduc joins 'The Ingraham Angle' after Putin's army bombs civilians A retired U.S. brigadier general told Fox News on Friday that Russian President Vladimir Putin is decidedly a war criminal after firsthand accounts and video of his army bombing civilians and reportedly using taboo ordnances in several cases. Brig. Gen. Don Bolduc told ""The Ingraham Angle"" that there is no need for an international commission or an investigation because the videos from Ukraine do not lie. Presidents Biden and Putin Bolduc warned about the dangers of hyperbaric ordnances — so-called ""vacuum bombs"" — that create vacuums via a secondary detonation that vaporizes anything in range, including humans. : ‘’ ‘ ’ 'S ""The invasion is a war crime,"" Bolduc told host Bill Hemmer. ""I don't need a special commission, I don't need a bunch of investigations. I don't need a team of lawyers or team anybody to make the observation that this whole invasion is a war crime."" ""And Putin is a war criminal. And any of his officers that are executing these kinds of directives from him are committing war crimes as well. And it's unforgivable in its nature."" Putin, in the wake of Biden's comments, says Russia knows ""how to defend our own interests."" Hemmer recounted viewing graphic video from Kharkiv, Ukraine, of senior citizens missing limbs after an alleged Putin-directed attack on their area. Bolduc, who is also running against Sen. Margaret Hassan, D-N.H., this fall, said a moral leader would never act as the 69-year-old ex- officer has, adding that ""he's got no morals."" ""If it's on the battlefield, he's going to use it,"" he said, adding that the hyperbaric bombs have been produced since World War , but the technology therein has advanced exponentially. Hemmer noted that Secretary-Gen. Jens Stoltenberg announced Putin also used cluster bombs — ordnance that have several tiny ""bomb-lets"" within that scatter near a target. Stoltenberg, a former Norwegian prime minister, said the use of such weapons violates international law. ""It's just not a legitimate weapon,"" Bolduc added.

Kyiv is next. ""Don’t let Putin turn Ukraine into Syria,"" Ukraine Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba tweeted after the Foreign Ministers meeting today. Sadly, Russia under Putin has recent experience blowing up cities as seen in Aleppo in Syria in 2016 and in Grozny in the second Chechen war in 1999-2000, where tens of thousands died. Putin wants Kyiv. Especially if he can’t catch Zelensky. : ""His only instinct is going to be to double down and to try and 'Grozny-fy' Kyiv,"" British Prime Minister Boris Johnson warned Mar. 2. ""He will, in his own words, carry out his operation to ‘de-Nazify’ Ukraine to the end,"" French President Emanuel Macron said after his phone call with Putin Thursday. The battle for Kyiv will decide the course of the war and set Europe’s security challenges for a generation. Putin's model of glory is the 1945 Red Army conquest of Hitler's Berlin. The battle for Kyiv will decide the course of the war and set Europe’s security challenges for a generation. Putin's model of glory is the 1945 Red Army conquest of Hitler's Berlin. As the Red Army wiped away Nazis in World War , so Putin want to see his armies to sweep across Ukraine. This is a delusional conquest. There are no Nazis in Ukraine. Ukraine is full of patriots who want democracy. Vladimir President Vladimir Putin ordered Russia’s all-out invasion of Ukraine only eight months after magazine billed President Biden as ready to take on the Russian leader. The city fight is familiar ground for Putin. He craves this battle. Twisted Putin thinks he will become greater than Lenin and Khrushchev by standing up for Russia and taking back all of Ukraine. World opinion on casualties won’t affect him. A Russian flag over smoking rubble is his goal. , 'S President Biden and Europe and the world have at most a few days left to make sure Ukraine's fighting forces are supplied for what lies ahead. It may soon be down to hours. Tanks are already probing Kyiv suburbs. At some point, the Russian convoy north of Kyiv will move down to encircle the city. A cultural and community centre, which locals said was destroyed by recent shelling, as Russia's invasion of Ukraine continues, in the settlement of Byshiv in the Kyiv region, Ukraine March 4, 2022. First, Ukraine must keep a supply route open out to the west even under attack. Fighting for Kyiv will consume Ukraine’s weapons and supplies, fast. Ukraine’s armed forces claim they’ve destroyed many Russian tanks and vehicles, which is good, but it also means they are using up Javelin anti-tank missiles. The U.S. and should do whatever it takes to help Ukraine hold airfields and roads in Ukraine’s west. Few Russian forces are in that area so far. Next, Ukraine says they are going on the counter-offensive. As the Russian convoy north of Kyiv moves south, they must pick their targets carefully. Yes, Ukraine should strike Russian tanks, but their overall aim should be to break up and harass Russian formations by hitting resupply vehicles, too. , U.S. Ukraine can also disrupt Russian command and control. For example, that Russian supply convoy north of Kyiv has a mobile command post, with officers near it, and a known electronic signature squawking out even if they try to mask it. All are targets. Of course, Ukrainian forces will find their own communications disrupted by street-to-street fighting around buildings and by Russian electronic warfare. The U.S. and can help, with links to up to satellites, drones or other radio relays to stay in contact. The one thing that would stop Putin from taking Kyiv is a strong no-fly zone. All week Zelensky and his officials have repeatedly asked for help to ""close the skies."" The answer’s been no. If Kyiv is encircled, it’s not over. Ukraine’s defenders may end up attacking Russian forces in the city while other Ukrainian forces hit the siege lines from outside. Senior Russian commanders know in their bones that a pitched fight in Kyiv will be hell. The Russian army in 1942-1943 swallowed up entire German divisions at Stalingrad. Today’s Russian generals had grandfathers and great-grandfathers in that fight. Their defense of Stalingrad was glorious. Now the tables are turned. The Russians invading Ukraine are on the wrong side morally – and tactically. If keeps helping, Russia will lose the city fight. A man stands next to a burnt car near a cultural and community centre, which locals said was destroyed by recent shelling, as Russia's invasion of Ukraine continues, in the settlement of Byshiv in the Kyiv region, Ukraine on March 4, 2022. Many wonder if direct U.S. and military help to Kyiv under siege risks nuclear escalation. Considering the long history of and Russian nuclear confrontation, I'd say no. Putin will do anything to take Kyiv – except nuke it. Here’s why. A Russian tactical nuclear strike would affect Russian forces as well as Ukrainians. Remember also that Putin intends to ""save"" and occupy Ukraine. Radiation is not part of his plan. And for all his veiled threats, Putin knows full well that the extended nuclear deterrence endorsed by every U.S. President since Truman is still in place.

President Biden's administration is sending mixed messages about alleged Russian war crimes during the ongoing invasion of Ukraine. Asked Friday whether a reported strike on a Ukrainian nuclear power plant would constitute a war crime to the U.S. government, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said there were still internal investigations underway. ""We have an internal review that's been ongoing prior to last night to collect evidence and data of the targeting of civilians, of the reported use of horrific weapons of war on the ground in Ukraine,"" Psaki said. : ""That's an ongoing process. We have not made conclusions. It's a legal review and a process that goes through the administration."" The U.S. Embassy to Ukraine, however, indicated Friday morning that the Russians had committed a war crime. ""It is a war crime to attack a nuclear power plant. Putin's shelling of Europe's largest nuclear plant takes his reign of terror one step further,"" the embassy tweeted. Hundreds of civilians have been killed since Russian forces started bombing populated areas across Ukraine, according to numerous reports. At least one cluster munition strike hit a hospital, killing four and injuring 10. The first Geneva Convention in 1864 outlawed assaults on medical personnel on the battlefield. ""We cannot confirm the existence of the use of cluster munitions inside Ukraine, nor can we confirm the use or existence of thermobaric weapons inside Ukraine. We've seen reports of them mobilizing their reserves,"" U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield said Wednesday. ""We cannot confirm those reports. So rather than speculating about what that might indicate, I would just tell you that we've seen them, but we can't confirm those reports."" Cluster munitions are explosives that contain smaller bombs. They can strike wide areas and raze entire civilian neighborhoods.

Several buildings in Starobilsk within the Luhansk Oblast region of Ukraine show significant damage because of shelling, according to images shared by the State Emergency Service of Ukraine.

Sen. Joni Ernst speaks during a press conference following the weekly Senate Republican policy luncheon in the Russell Senate Office Building on Capitol Hill on January 19, 2022, in Washington, . The Wagner Group, technically a private Russian military company, has been considered a proxy group of the Russian state abroad since its inception in 2014 and participated in the annexation of Crimea. In December, the European Union, with support from the State Department, enacted sanctions against the Wagner Group and its associates for serious human rights abuses, including torture and extrajudicial killings in countries including Libya, Syria, the Central African Republic and Ukraine’s Donbas region. The paramilitary organization was founded by Utkiny, a veteran of both Chechen wars and a former member of the Main Intelligence Directorate, or the Russian intelligence agency abbreviated as . 400 : An alleged close ally to Putin, Russian oligarch Prigozhin has been accused of financially backing the Wagner Group. He is wanted by the for allegedly attempting to interfere with U.S. elections from early 2014 to 2018 through St. Petersburg-based Internet Research Agency, dubbed the ""troll factory."" Pikalov is a colonel who’s been accused of heading the Wagner Group’s operations in Africa. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy stands alongside other government officials in a video posted to social media Friday vowing to defend the country from a Russian invasion. Ernst, a combat veteran and member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, signed the letter dated March 2 and exclusively obtained by Fox News Digital on Thursday. It was signed by Sens. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, Mike Braun, R-Indiana, Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., and Bill Hagerty, R-Tenn. Last April, Biden issued an executive order targeting the Russian Federation for broad sweeping offenses, which included undermining the conduct of free and fair democratic elections and democratic institutions in the U.S., issuing malicious cyber activity against the U.S. and its allies, and threatening ""well-established principles of international law, including respect for the territorial integrity of states."" The letter notes that Biden said in his order that ""persons responsible for or complicit in, or have directly or indirectly engaged or attempted to engage"" in the ""assassination, murder or other unlawful killing of, or infliction of other bodily harm against, a United States person or a citizen or national of a United States ally or partner; activities that undermine the peace, security, political stability, or territorial integrity of the United States, its allies, or its partners"" are eligible for expansive economic sanctions.

""And three, they are getting resistance from the Ukrainians.

Roughly 90% of Russia's 150,000-strong force – built up along Ukraine’s border in the lead up to the invasion – is believed to have entered Ukraine from the north, east and south. Despite repeated efforts by Russian forces to make it to Kyiv, a 40-mile-long convoy headed straight for the capital city has been stalled for three days. Reports have surfaced suggesting that everything from weather to mechanical errors have halted its progress and Russian troops remain roughly 15 to 20 miles outside of Kyiv. ""We certainly believe it is their intent to encircle the city from multiple directions,"" the senior defense official said. The official noted that Putin’s troops have not made significant advances in encroaching on the city. However, they warned that just because Russia is advancing at a pace slower than originally believed ""doesn't mean that they aren't making any progress."" Heavy shelling has hit cities like Chernihiv and Kharkiv, located in the north of Ukraine, and over 480 Russian missiles have been levied throughout the country – hitting Ukrainian military points, government buildings and residential areas.

Anti-aircraft and anti-tank weapons are crucial to continue to hold off Russian forces, according to the defenders. They are hoping for more sanctions, membership and the European Union and possibly, eventually, . ""Even under these conditions, we fight … and we protect democracy,"" Omelyan said. ""On the other hand, we protect our homeland, and we protect our citizens. That’s why we will fight to the last bullet, whatever it takes, and nobody is going to surrender. It’s not Afghanistan.

The circumstances of the 47-year-old’s death were not immediately clear, but the Kremlin-backed Pravda said he was killed ""during a special operation in Ukraine."" According to Russia’s state-owned news agency, Russian President Vladimir Putin appointed Sukhovetsky deputy commander of the 41st Combined Arms Army of the Central Military District last year.

With Putin's invasion of Ukraine being ‘the most monumental thing’ that has happened in Europe since the end of World War , Fox News host Bill Hemmer and Bill Whittle dive into the various military machines the Russians are using to attack Ukraine and how the country rebuilt its military force after the fall of the Soviet Union. ""It was an open secret that Vladimir Putin had plans to go into Ukraine. The deployment happened in real-time right before our eyes. We watched his soldiers move south. We saw his tanks massing at the border, and then on cue, they rolled, flew, and sailed uninvited into a sovereign nation,"" said Hemmer. After the Soviet Union collapsed, so did now-Russia's military. ""The entire Soviet arsenal was just left to rust-- just left to rust. Their submarines are rusting on the docks. Army's underprepared, underfed, underarmed,"" said Whittle. Tanks move during the Union Courage-2022 Russia-Belarus military drills at the Obuz-Lesnovsky training ground in Belarus. Whittle explained that after the Soviet Union fell, it took Russia ""three decades"" to build back its ""war machine"" which resulted in a ""leaner and meaner"" military force. ""So now the Russian Army and Russian forces are in a situation where they're much smaller than they were during the Cold War, and they're also considerably more advanced technologically,"" explained Whittle. Hemmer went on to discuss how the Ukrainians are, in some ways, a generation behind in regard to military equipment. ""The Ukrainians are fighting the Soviet Union's equipment against modern-day Russia, and there's a considerable gap between these two,"" added Whittle, emphasizing the discrepancy between the two country's military forces. ""When Putin decided to move his restored force in the position, he called in the Armored Personnel Carrier, known as the . The was born during the Cold War when the U.S. and the Soviets needed to move troops into battle under heavy fire,"" said Whittle. Whittle discussed how infantry no longer ""walk"" into battles.

In addition to the army, Ukrainian civilians have taken up arms in the midst of Russian military aggression that has so far proved difficult for Moscow to confront while still struggling to achieve air dominance. They don't need to win the battles as much as they need to defend themselves, said John Spencer, a retired Army major who saw close combat in Iraq and serves as a colonel with the California National Guard and the director of Urban Warfare Training for the 40th Infantry Division.

Ukrainian soldiers ride in a military vehicle in Mariupol, Ukraine last week. Currently, a Russian convoy 40 miles along is making its way toward Kyiv and Moscow has stepped up airstrikes as it targets large population centers like Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city located in the northeast. Part of Russia's doctrine, Spencer said, was to unleash large amounts of firepower in an effort to create a psychological impact and protect its forces. As the slow convoy moves closer to the capital, more attacks should be expected as Russia attempts to ""soften"" enemy targets and further isolate the city. ""You can clearly see their plan is to isolate all the eastern Ukraine armies on the east and to further isolate the capital,"" Spencer said. ""That 40-mile convoy's sole purpose is to isolate and penetrate the capital."" If Russia surrounds the city, it could cut off Ukrainian fighters inside, forcing them to hold out for extended periods without reinforcements and supplies from the West as they battle block-by-block, Spencer said. However, an assault on a city versus an open area requires several times more troops than in any other environment, Spencer said. He noted it usually takes five attackers for every defender, citing U.S. Army doctrine. Because of the terrain, cities are also good for strengthening defense plans. Despite being outgunned, the Ukrainians can be effective in dense, urban terrain if they use their firepower and surveillance in smart ways, he said. ""The amount of combat power and forces you need to do an operation like this, Russia doesn't have it in its army if the Ukrainians defend right,"" Spencer said. Since the invasion began, videos and news reports have shown Russian forces attacked, their equipment destroyed and some soldiers taken prisoner. The convoy headed to Kyiv is most likely tasked with taking the capital in what could be a large-scale assault, Spencer said. In a Twitter thread that went viral over the weekend, he gave a crash course to civilian resistors on a number of tactics to defend themselves, including building obstacles and barriers in the streets and fighting in places where they can take cover instead of exposing themselves in open areas, something urban terrain offer in abundance. Part of Ukraine's success is their determination but also because of Russia's failures, he said. ""The Russians made so many bad decisions,"" he said. ""It was straight hubris to believe they could take Ukraine in a couple of days.""",14,4.420704264022958,3.696548575750465,0.7241556882724929,10

2022-03-02,Fox,https://www.foxnews.com/world/minister-no-lavrov-embodies-moscows-steely-posture,'Minister No': Lavrov embodies Moscow’s steely posture,"Fox News correspondent Benjamin Hall has the latest developments from Lviv, Ukraine. — As Russia's top diplomat during the invasion of Ukraine, Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov is embodying the Kremlin's defiant posture with a mixture of toughness and sarcasm. While President Vladimir Putin single-handedly shapes the country’s foreign policy, Lavrov delivers Moscow’s message with a bluntness uncharacteristic of a diplomat. In the role for nearly 18 years, the 71-year-old Lavrov has seen relations with the West shift from near-friendly to openly hostile, plummeting to a catastrophic new low with Russia's war against Ukraine. The invasion prompted the European Union to freeze the assets of both Putin and Lavrov, among others — an unprecedented blow to Moscow’s pride. Lavrov's tenure as foreign minister is second only to that of Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko, who was in office for 28 years. Like Gromyko, who was nicknamed Mr. Nyet , Lavrov has come to represent the uncompromising face of Kremlin foreign policy vis a vis the West. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov looks on as he gives an annual press conference on Russian diplomacy in 2021, in Moscow on January 14, 2022. He doesn’t mince words when defending what he sees as Moscow’s interests, and that style must appeal to the tough-talking Russian president. : In 2008, Lavrov famously responded to a reprimand from then British Foreign Secretary David Miliband by snapping: ""Who are you to lecture me?"" Like his boss, Lavrov has tapped into broad public nostalgia for the country’s Soviet-era clout. He has vented anger at the West, depicting the U.S. as arrogant, conceited, treacherous and determined to dominate the world. He has contemptuously dismissed Western allies as stooges obediently toeing Washington’s line to deter Russia. Standing next to British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss after their meeting last month, a grim-faced Lavrov snapped that their talks were like a ""conversation between deaf and dumb."" After a lifelong diplomatic career, Lavrov looks visibly bored by daily routine. When he appears before the media, he doesn’t bother to hide his irritation at a naive or provocative question, often responding with an air of contempt or plain mockery. ; , When a reporter in a video call from the Ukrainian capital asked Lavrov whether Moscow wants to topple the Ukrainian leadership, the aide who managed Friday’s briefing interrupted and said it wasn’t his turn to put a question. The reporter continued, and an angry Lavrov weighed in: ""He’s discourteous. He’s working in Ukraine now. He’s got infected with discourtesy."" Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov gestures during a press conference following talks with his Italian counterpart in Moscow, on February 17, 2022. Lavrov has particular distaste for photographers, showing annoyance at the clacking of camera shutters. At one news conference, he muttered an expletive into the microphone in apparent anger at disorderly reporters; the expression became a meme, widely adopted in T-shirt designs for the patriotic audience. Lavrov has weathered endless waves of speculation that he was on the verge of retirement. Instead, he has become one of the longest-lasting members of Putin’s Cabinet and a perennial figure among a changing kaleidoscope of foreign counterparts. ‘ ’ 'S Before becoming foreign minister, he served as Russia’s ambassador to the United Nations for 10 years and liked to have informal chats with journalists, trading news and jokes over a cigarette in the U.N. corridors. He writes poetry, sings songs on guitar with friends, and eagerly took part in skits with other diplomats at international events when Russia’s ties with the West were less rancorous. President Joe Biden , Russian President Vladimir Putin and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov pose for press prior to the -Russia summit at the Villa La Grange, in Geneva on June 16, 2021.

The air assault on overpopulated urban areas of Ukraine continued even as Moscow said it would be ready to resume talks aimed at stopping the new devastating war in Europe.

The Slovenian Foreign Ministry said its consulate in Kharkiv, located in another large building on the square, was destroyed. The attack on the square — the nucleus of public life in the city — was seen by many Ukrainians as brazen evidence that the Russian invasion wasn’t just about hitting military targets. The bombardment blew out windows and walls of buildings that ring the square, piled high with debris and dust. Inside one building, chunks of plaster were scattered, and doors lay across hallways. A Russian strike also damaged the regional police and intelligence headquarters in Kharkiv, according to the Ukrainian state emergency service. It said three people were wounded. The strike blew off the roof of the police building and set the top floor on fire, and pieces of the five-story building were strewn across adjacent streets, according to videos and photos released by the emergency service, according to The Associated Press.

Fox News correspondent Benjamin Hall warned Tuesday on ""The Ingraham Angle"" that Russian President Vladimir Putin ""will bring out the heavy artillery and hit the people"" if backed into a corner, noting that it's a ""playbook of his."" : The sun is rising today on the seventh day of this invasion, and frankly, there is a lot of fear about what it might bring, and that's because yesterday we saw Vladimir Putin increasing his bombardments on urban areas, on residential areas. And he has warned, his Defense Ministry has warned that that will continue today. Yesterday, we saw Putin's forces take out a well-known landmark — the television tower in Kyiv — and there is growing fear now that he's going to pull back and continue this crushing bombardment of built-up areas. They also rained down rockets yesterday on the second-biggest city of Kharkiv, while Russia's Defense Ministry urged residents of both cities to flee today, saying it was going to strike unspecified areas within the city and hit their communications. However, when it comes to that 40 mile–long armored convoy that we have been talking about, the one that had been bearing down on Kyiv, it has actually made no advances over the last 24 hours. And the U.S. official now saying, in fact, that it has been beset by logistical problems, supply issues — short on fuel and food. And there is growing talk that actually this is not going the way that Putin hoped it would, and that is why he is doubling down. That is why he is using his heavy artillery. That's why he's using his rockets. The death toll, it keeps rising, and so does the exodus. The is now saying that 677,000 people have left in the past six days. That number rising by about 100,000 a day at the moment. Again, no one knows what today will bring, but Vladimir Putin in his Defense Ministry, making it very clear they are going to continue hitting these cities. … What is most likely to enrage Vladimir Putin is a sense that this is not going how he wanted, and if he finds himself backed into a corner, he's going to do what we've seen him do over the last day or two, and that is bring out the heavy artillery and hit the people. He's done it before — he did it in Chechnya. It is a playbook of his. When he's not doing well, he doubles down.",17,3.6528749832764436,3.0463474416702128,0.6065275416062308,24

Congress needs to expedite approval and delivery of a new significant package of military aid to Ukraine. We are both employees of or advisors to the Global Special Operations Force Foundation, the professional association for special operations, and we understand that we can’t wait until the middle of March for the United States to send aid. Congress has an opportunity to quickly craft a proposal to send to the president this week. Time is of the essence. The battle for freedom and democracy in Ukraine is happening now and at a critical stage. This is the most consequential war since World War because the outcome will shape international security structures for the next century, especially in Europe and Central Asia. : '' ' ' , The conflict in Ukraine is a campaign that can’t be funded piecemeal. The required military material for Ukraine will exceed the $2.9 billion that is proposed in the $6.5 billion request from President Biden. Congress must approve $16.2 billion to cover the required military and humanitarian aid. President Joe Biden delivers his State of the Union address to a joint session of Congress at the Capitol, Tuesday, March 1, 2022. Combat operations are coming to a critical inflection point whereby both sides need to replenish supplies to the fighting forces and sustain the civilian populace. The question for both sides is who will run out of supplies logistically first, thus providing either the attacker or defender a substantial, if not decisive, advantage. The most urgent needs are to resupply the Ukrainians to defend themselves against unrestricted Russian aggression. The Ukrainian Armed Forces and populace are fighting effectively in many places but are outnumbered and often outgunned. The Russians have superior mobility and firepower but lack the essential local knowledge and the will to fight this fight. Once major cities are surrounded, and the eastern half of the Dnipro is secured, it will become attrition warfare after that. It is a matter of time before Kyiv runs out of ammunition, water, food, power, and civil necessities to keep society functioning. Firefighters work to contain a fire in buildings housing the Kharkiv regional security service and the regional police, allegedly hit by Russian shelling in Kharkiv on March 2, 2022. The United States has the capabilities to provide decisive aid to Ukrainian resistance forces. Ukrainian armed forces and defenders need to have the power, material, and capabilities to deny Russian resupply ground and air routes. They need the capabilities to break Russian encirclement perimeters. They need the resources to sustain the population’s basic needs during the length of the conflict while preparing for Russian occupation. Finally, they need to have the aid to expel Russian invasion forces from Ukraine’s territory. Without immediate support, the Ukrainian resistance will be doomed. There is a long list of general combat, armed forces, and supporting territorial needs, including ammunition for small arms, crew-serviced, and vehicle-mounted weapons of which the Ukrainian resistance has a need. The resistance needs tank and artillery ammunition of various calibers. They also need anti-tank munitions such as the Javelin missile and launchers with spare batteries, the -4, , and Karl Gustav weapon system. An aid package should help them secure night vision devices to include individual night vision goggles and aiming devices, and night vision and thermal/infrared sights for crew-served weapons. Finally, they need Stinger anti-aircraft systems, hand-held communications, small tactical drones, individual protective equipment, field rations, and field medical kits. All of these are immediate military needs that should be sent as quickly as possible to the resistance in Ukraine through reliable supply routes. A view of damaged regional police station after a Russian missile attack in Kharkiv, Ukraine, on March 2, 2022. There is another bucket of aid in the form of support for the command and leadership in Ukraine. They need secure, long-range communications base stations and associated antennas. There needs to be aid to reconstitute the Ukrainian psychological operations facilities destroyed by Russian missile strikes. Remote portable s, radios, and an alternative secure internet communications system that do not have to rely on land-based communications that transit through Russia are needed. Finally, there needs to be an information and broadcast center that can reach into Russia to counter the Kremlin’s disinformation. An aid package should designate funds for humanitarian support for Ukraine, Poland and Romania to deal with the humanitarian crisis. Emergency communications, pioneer equipment, hand tools, sensors, urban rescue supplies, temporary shelter materials, use of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance warehouse supplies, and Internally Displaced Persons camp sets and kits will help the victims of this aggression. Resistance forces need aid to be armed and trained with lethal munitions, weapons, secure communications, supporting equipment, secure basing, infrastructure, basic life support for developing, training to support Ukrainian resistance forces. Clothing, equipment, weapons, and ammunition for training and employment should also be a part of the lethal aid provided that should also provide secure communications and transportation capabilities. Congress is working on a supplemental that could be added to the 22 appropriations package. That plan should be comprehensive and specific. The problem with this plan is that it will not be signed until March 11, 2022, at the earliest. That is too late. Without immediate support, the Ukrainian resistance will be doomed. Congress and our federal government need to move at the speed of war if we wish to see democracy protected in Ukraine.

Jack Keane shares his military outlook on warfare in Eastern Europe. A sole protester stood outside the complex known as the Russian Diplomatic Compound in New York City’s Riverdale neighborhood on Thursday, hours after a long-anticipated war began across the world in Ukraine. The compound, a white high-rise tower located at 355 West 255th Street, sits at one of the highest points in New York City and has often been the subject of speculation surrounding the building's purpose and residents' practices. The building is home to Russian diplomats, many of whom work in the United States as intelligence officers – or intelligence ""operatives,"" as the Russians call them – and seek information or connections that the federation might need, multiple experts told Fox News Digital. ""They view us as threat number one. And sooner or later, they believe that information will be useful, whether it's for wartime or peacetime."" : Most Russian intelligence officers – those who work for the Foreign Intelligence Service or the federation's military intelligence agency, known as the – live in the building, which is known to some law enforcement officers as the ""plex,"" said Robin Dreeke, a retired special agent and former head of the bureau’s Counterintelligence Behavioral Analysis Program. But some senior-level Russian intelligence officers and select others are allowed to rent homes in the Riverdale area itself, Dreeke said. And the existence of the intelligence officers living among New Yorkers is common knowledge to some, he added. Woman stands outside Russian Diplomatic Compound on West 255th Street in Riverdale, on Thursday, Feb. 24, 2022 Police vehicles parked outside Russian Diplomatic Compound on West 255th Street in Riverdale, on Thursday, Feb. 24, 2022 ""Open secret is a good way to put it,"" Dreeke said, when asked. ""I think they think it’s more of a secret than we do."" When asked on whom or what these intelligence officers might be spying, Dreeke said, ""everything."" ""A lot of people think that spies are just going for the high-level classified military infrastructure kind of stuff,"" Dreeke continued. While that is true, ""the real purpose of spying/intelligence collection is filling information gaps that another country has, and mostly to provide their policymakers and decision-makers the knowledge they need that's not common knowledge that they can get through legitimate means."" Dreeke has first-hand experience with the compound, as he spent hours outside the building during his time with the New York’s Russian Military Intelligence Squad from 1997 to 2005. To put it simply, his unit tried to recruit Russian spies and then neutralize them to protect American interests, national security and allies. : He remained involved with numerous operations related to officers throughout his career. He later founded a company, People Formula, and has since authored several books.

There are two types of intelligence officers, Dreeke said: those who pose a symmetrical threat, and those who pose an asymmetrical threat. Those working in New York and living at the ""plex"" and working at the mission to the United Nations are under ""diplomatic cover."" ""It’s what we called a ‘symmetrical threat.’ We know they’re here. They’re diplomats under diplomatic cover, so they actually have all the privileges of diplomats. So, when they’re caught conducting espionage against our country, you can’t throw them in jail, because they’re diplomats,"" Dreeke continued. He added: ""No one likes it. But it’s a fact of life."" But they’re different from the undercover operatives who are not under official cover and are in the United States. Those who pose an ""asymmetrical threat,"" undercover operatives such as Jack Barsky, who operate under non-official cover, under ""false pretenses, with fake names."" Barsky grew up in East Germany and was later recruited by the now-defunct , Russia’s security agency, before it ultimately became the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation . According to a biography on his website, he lived a double life in America for 10 years – during which time he worked as a spy for the Soviet Union. Barsky left the job and was later arrested by the . He is now an American citizen who has become a prominent author and public speaker. Only diplomats live in the Russian compound in Riverdale, meaning any Russian intelligence officer who has asymmetrical intentions would not. Similar compounds are located anywhere in the country where there is a Russian consulate, Dreeke said. A , There are Russian diplomats living inside the complex who are not intelligence officers, he went on. ""And then you have others that, they do the diplomatic job probably one or two hours a day. And the rest of the day is spent collecting intelligence"" to fill information gaps and then sending that information to the Russian government in Moscow, he said. Rebekah Koffler, a Russian-born former intelligence officer for the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency, called the process of having intelligence officers stationed in parts of the world ""a standard procedure."" ""The United States also has intelligence officers posted all over the world,"" she said. As for the Russian compound in Riverdale, the Russian intelligence officers who live there ""don’t necessarily spy on that community. They spy in general – they spy on the United States."" Koffler and Dreeke noted the diligence with which Russian intelligence officers do their research, which they then use to form their policies and operations. ""They do their homework,"" Koffler said. ""That's the one thing that is very different from the way that we do things. We're just not nearly as diligent."" Koffler, author of ""Putin’s Playbook,"" added that Russian intelligence officers ""do their homework for years,"" regardless of whether the information is pertinent to current events. ""They collect regardless – the Russians and the Chinese do – Because that's just how they do business,"" Koffler went on. ""They view us as threat number one. And sooner or later, they believe that information will be useful, whether it's for wartime or peacetime, when they want to undermine and somehow cause some kind of disruption."" '' , ',' Russian intelligence officers who are in the United States under diplomatic cover are not necessarily interested in the people who live in the neighborhood. They will try to make friendships and become close with people whom the Russian government deems potentially useful, such as government officials or their friends – ""somebody from whom they can collect information,"" Koffler explained.

""It’s not like they try to steal your wallet or your purse and get your information that way,"" she said. ""It’s called targeteering – they identify, ‘, we need a list, we need somebody in your State Department,’ or, ‘We need somebody at the United Nations’ … and they do their homework and they study"" their target, Koffler further said. She went on: ""Where does this or that person hang out? Do they play golf, for example? Once they identify who exactly they need, what kind of access, they figure out that person's patterns of behavior … they would show up, like, on a tennis court if you are playing tennis. And they would strike a conversation with you and try to be your friend. And you have no idea that you've been targeted because it all looks so innocuous and accidental."" Dreeke said Russian intelligence officers are looking to get to classified or proprietary information as well as those individuals who are in the position to know about it. The information they’re seeking can depend on the ""flavor of the day."" During his time investigating Russian operatives and goals, Chechnya was among the topics of importance for the federation, Dreeke said. ""They wanted to know what different organizations were due to support or defend Chechnya,"" he said. ""Cancer research, believe it or not, was a huge one … They were also tracking shipping – of all kinds of things, they’re tracking things like [meals ready-to-eat] … because that might tell you where the U.S. forces are building up or not building up."" Based on his experience, Dreeke estimated that 95% to 98% of the information that intelligence officers are collecting is ""benign,"" while the remaining 5% to 2% is classified – ""it is proprietary that does that greater damage."" A view of the Russian Diplomatic Compound at 355 West 255th Street Located on tree-lined West 255th Street and Mosholu Avenue, the building is 20 stories high, and features 15 residential units per floor, according to The Riverdale Press. ""The Russians constructed it on top of the hill so they could actually have good radio receiving and transmissions from that point,"" Dreeke said. ""They strategically bought on that property, so they could actually monitor the radio traffic, as well.""

Dynamic demonstration is a part of the Army Games public display. Thermobaric explosives, also called fuel-air explosives , use oxygen around them to generate a high-temperature blast. The blast wave typically lasts longer than a conventional explosive and has the ability to vaporize people. 'S 40 'S : ""The [blast] kill mechanism against living targets is unique--and unpleasant...."" reads a 1993 U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency study. ""What kills is the pressure wave, and more importantly, the subsequent rarefaction [vacuum], which ruptures the lungs.... If the fuel deflagrates but does not detonate, victims will be severely burned and will probably also inhale the burning fuel. Since the most common fuels, ethylene oxide and propylene oxide, are highly toxic, undetonated should prove as lethal to personnel caught within the cloud as most chemical agents."" Using such explosives is a breach of the Geneva Convention, which established guidelines for humanitarian treatment of populations in war. ' ' Russia has a long history with the explosives.

The Ukrainian Postal Service, or Ukrposhta, said it was celebrating its 30-plus years by replacing its ""All-Ukrainian People's Contest"" with the best sketch of a postal stamp called ""Russian military ship, go on."" The postal agency posted several stamp ideas on social media. One appeared to be a warship shaped like the Kremlin sinking into a pool of blood, an apparent reference to the stiff opposition Ukrainian forces are putting up.

2022-02-28,Fox,https://www.foxnews.com/world/putin-chechen-fighters-ukraine,"Putin sends Chechen fighters to Ukraine, with results unclear","Fox News national security correspondent Jennifer Griffin reacts to reports that Putin is attempting to escalate tensions in order to deescalate them. Vladimir Putin’s move to send the battle-hardened and much-feared Chechen fighters to reinforce his invasion into Ukraine might have initially backfired, according to reports coming out of Ukraine. Observers said the soldiers could have been sent in as headhunters to kill or capture senior Ukrainian politicians, but they say those initial efforts have been thwarted by Ukraine’s military. The Chechens are part of a Russian national guard unit and are well known for fighting insurgencies, using brutal tactics that even jolted Russia during its two brutal wars in the '90s against them. The Chechens have been employed to hunt down terrorists in Syria and used by Russia to fight elsewhere, including in Georgia. They also fought the Ukrainians in Donbas when hostilities began there in 2014. The Chechen Republic is a predominantly Muslim region in the Caucuses, and while it's still part of Russia, it has been granted a lot of autonomy by Putin, who is close to Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov. Kadyrov announced this weekend that his troops were in Ukraine. Reports on their number varied from 7,000 to tens of thousands. Kadyrov said he supported Putin’s decision to invade and that his troops, ""will carry out his orders under any circumstances,"" Reuters reported. He also claimed none of his troops have died or suffered injuries, according to Reuters. Yet, unconfirmed reports coming out of Kyiv claimed Ukrainian forces had taken out some 56 Chechen tanks and killed one of its high-ranking commanders on the way to the capital. While the Chechen leader denied his commander’s death, if true, observers said, even this early on in the campaign it could be a problem for Putin, given the massive fight of resistance being put on by Ukrainian military forces against the Russian aggressor. Theodore Karasik, a fellow on Russia and Middle East affairs at the Jamestown Foundation, told Fox News Digital, ""The Chechens are getting hit for now, and it’s based on the fact that they [the Ukrainians] did their homework. They understood how Chechens fight."" Putin and Russia are said to have relied on Chechen fighters many times in past decades. Karasik said even with the Chechens’ historic background of being lethal fighters on the battleground, during these early stages of the invasion, ""instead of the Chechens targeting them, have targeted the Chechens. They got them before they had time to really act. That doesn’t mean the Chechen units are inactive, but they are getting slowed down tremendously in these first few days."" : Karasik, who has written a book on Russia's actions in the Middle East, as well as on the Chechen conflict with Russia, said he saw these reports as adding to the anxiety of the Russian general staff. ""When [Sergei] Shoygu, the defense minister, has to go sit with Putin at a distance because Kadyrov was mouthing off and whining that they're getting their a--es kicked, this will send a shock wave about a response. So, this is why I think we're seeing a bigger aggression by Russia."" ""We are only in day 5, and the Chechens got surprised because of Kadyrov’s relationship with the Kremlin. This looks bad for him. So, his highly trained fighters, some of whom have trained in other theaters, have to go back and fight harder, and Putin knows that,"" Karasik said. As the Ukrainian military is fighting to keep control of Kyiv and Ukraine’s second-largest city, Kharkiv, observers expected to see the Chechen units moving in with them. Karasik warned that some of the Chechens likely will be assigned to ""a 'kidnap and kill' portion, since they have had a history of doing these types of operations."" Global affairs analyst Jonathan Wachtel, who as a journalist based in Moscow in the ‘90s, covered conflicts in the former Soviet Union, including Chechnya, told Fox News Digital that maybe one reason Putin sent the Chechens in so early on in the fighting was to boost the morale of the troops, given the heavy losses they’re taking. Military service is compulsory in Russia, so many conscripts may not have the will to fight, particularly against people who are predominantly ethnic Slavs following similar cultures. Having the feared Chechen fighters in the arena might shake things up at this early stage. ""As fighters, they have a reputation that goes back centuries of being ferocious and instilling fear among invading armies that tried and failed to crush them. So, you end up with Chechen characters in novels by Tolstoy and Pushkin, some of the great literary giants of Russian literature, and this fear of the Chechens fighter is not for nothing,"" Wachtel said. He continued, ""They're known for being extremely capable in battle, strategically shrewd, cunning, relentless and vicious -- they fight to the death even when they know that they are outnumbered."" Wachtel, who worked under U.S. Ambassadors to the United Nations Nikki Haley and Kelly Craft, said when Putin came to power, he crushed Grozny, the capital city of Chechnya, and launched a ruthless military campaign, but the Chechens ran a ferocious counterinsurgency and acts of terrorism against civilian targets that caused the Russians plenty of problems. He said while it seemed an unusual relationship between Putin and Kadyrov, the Russian president ""managed to work out a relationship with him and his fighters to have loyalty where they can maintain leadership of the region of Chechnya in exchange for Russian financial and infrastructure support."" Wachtel concluded, ""In this fashion, and as ironic as it is, given the tangled and violent history between Russians and Chechens, he is essentially in Putin's pocket and that’s because it is helpful to him as well, he maintains power and control and ensures that his people are getting the support they need."" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has claimed there have been some 4,500 Russian casualties so far, and while the Russian defense ministry did acknowledge on the weekend for the first time that some of its soldiers had been killed and injured, it didn’t give a number. Ukraine’s Interior Ministry said 352 Ukrainian civilians have been killed, including 14 children, during Russia’s invasion. Some 2,000 citizens have also been hurt in the fighting so far.

Jack Keane discusses Russia's invasion of Ukraine and Putin's potential weaknesses on 'One Nation.' Russian President Vladimir Putin had a long career as an intelligence officer in the former Soviet Union’s – the former Communist spy agency – and likely took great efforts to plan his invasion of Ukraine before sending thousands of troops into the country earlier this week. But American and British intelligence analysts say Russia appears to have underestimated Ukraine’s defensive capabilities – at least initially. Russia’s stalled advance could be because of faulty or ignored intelligence, according to Dan Hoffman, a former senior officer and station chief. But it’s impossible for anyone outside the Kremlin to know for sure, he added. Russian President Vladimir Putin had a long career as an intelligence officer in the former Soviet Union’s – the former Communist spy agency – and likely took great efforts to plan his invasion of Ukraine before sending thousands of troops into the country earlier this week. : ""Is Russia surprised by all this? Yes,"" he told Fox News Digital Saturday. ""Therefore, they didn't do a great job in collecting the intelligence that they needed. And that's pretty humiliating, because Ukraine's on their border and they were occupying pieces of it."" Putin invaded Ukraine’s Crimea region in 2014 and has been backing separatists in two other eastern regions of the country, an area collective known as Donbas, and he said he would recognize them as independent republics in the days before the all-out invasion of Ukraine. ""Why did Vladimir Putin do this?"" he asked. ""He should have known these things – but didn’t."" Ukrainian servicemen are seen next to a destroyed armoured vehicle, which they said belongs to the Russian army, outside Kharkiv, Ukraine February 24, 2022. - ; ‘I , , ’ Hoffman had predicted back in 2019 that Putin’s long-term objective ""is the destruction of Ukraine as a state."" ""Putin doesn’t want a successful democracy next door serving as a beacon of hope and inspiration for his own domestic opponents, who are denied basic civil liberties,"" he wrote at the time, along with Sir Nicholas Soames, a former United Kingdom defense minister. And Putin could have been planning that destruction for as long as two decades, he said. Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine earlier this week, with Putin claiming the move was a defensive measure amid threats from Ukraine. The White House warned earlier this month that U.S. intelligence had predicted the invasion on fabricated grounds.

A civilian hiding in a bomb shelter said on Friday that Russia has no chance in taking over Ukraine. ""I can tell you that I am here with an awful lot – a group of really angry people. They believe that if he occupies the country, then he has another thing coming for him. Apparently, according to official stats, there has been 2,800 Russian troops killed in Ukraine just today,"" Mychailo Wynnyckyj, associate professor at National University of Kyiv-Mohyla Academy, told ""The Story w/ Martha McCallum"" on Friday.

Russian forces have faced more resistance than anticipated from Ukrainian forces, according to a senior U.S. defense official. After two days of war, Ukrainian command and control is still intact, and no population centers have been taken. And Russia has yet to achieve air superiority, with Ukraine’s air and missile defense capability still working, though degraded, the defense official told reporters Friday. ""The Russians have lost a little bit of their momentum,"" the defense official told reporters, speaking on background. The official added, ""In general we assess the Russian forces are encountering greater resistance than they expected."" Despite Ukraine’s effort in warding off Russian forces, they need the United States’ help. ""Yeah, we are getting clobbered at the moment because they’ve got air superiority over us at the moment,"" Wynnyckyj said. ""Any kind of ground advances are being stopped. The stories that I’ve seen today are absolutely amazing, in terms of shooting down paratroopers before they land on the ground."" ""We desperately need air support. We desperately need a no-fly zone in this country … we are asking Americans help us with that,"" he continued. ""But you know what? If we get a no-fly zone, we will be able to handle things on our own over here. Because these Russians have absolutely no chance of doing anything in this country.""

Stoltenberg asserted there ""has been a crisis in the making for a long time,"" as has been working to gradually increase its presence in the eastern flank since Russia annexed Crimea in 2014. With Russia and Belarus stating its troops will remain in the north of Ukraine, Stoltenberg said has made additional reinforcements in recent weeks and months. ""I think what we are now faced with is a new normal in European security. We see Russia being willing to contest fundamental values for our security by the use of force and also by the threat of use of force,"" Stoltenberg said. ""We have reinforced and implemented the biggest reinforcement of collective defense since the end of the Cold War, with battlegroups in the Baltic region, in Poland, with increased defense spending every year since 2014 and with a higher readiness of the forces."" He also acknowledged the potential of a refugee crisis if Russia does invade Ukraine. ""The most important thing is to prevent a new armed attack on Ukraine, and therefore we support all efforts by allies to find a political solution, and 's also ready to sit down in the -Russia Council with Russia. If Russia decides to use force, that may, of course, be a large number of people fleeing Ukraine,"" Stoltenberg said, adding that the Response Force will be prepared to deploy to offer assistance in neighboring countries like Poland and Romania. Speaking at the Munich Security Conference in Germany Saturday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called on his country’s allies to do more, arguing that Ukraine is being treated as a buffer state between the West and Russia. When pressed by Brennan Sunday about the issue, Stoltenberg said does not have a set date for when Ukraine might become a member of the bloc. ""We have not set any timeline for that,"" Stoltenberg said. "" allies have been very clear that it is for Ukraine and 30 allies to decide on membership and not Russia. And second, we have provided over many years significant support to Ukraine."" ""We help them to modernize the defense and security institutions to strengthen their cyber defenses,"" he continued. "" allies, the United States, United Kingdom, Canada and others have also provided significant training and different kinds of military equipment, defensive weapons. So, the Ukrainian Armed Forces are much stronger now with better equipped, better trained troops than in 2014. And this is not least because of all the support that 's allies have provided over all these years.""",29,2.6836497414410405,3.0934844806319513,-0.40983473919091074,14

The expectation of Russia invading Ukraine is becoming progressively more likely based on recent military patterns, Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., analyzed on ""America Reports"" Thursday.

""The sad fact is that Russia has troops encircling Ukraine and they’re exposed on almost every front,"" he said.

""Those military drills… are nothing but a cover for a likely invasion,"" Cotton said. ""I think they tell us, since they’re starting so soon, that we could be down to a matter of days, not weeks.""

Russia has massed an estimated 100,000 troops near Ukraine's borders, stoking fears in the West of an invasion.

In Fox Nation’s new special ""Fox Nation 101: The Ukraine Crisis,"" Russian scholar and former Moscow correspondent David Satter details the history between the two countries beginning with the birth of ancient Russian city Kyiv -- the center of contemporary Ukraine. But the fall of the Soviet Union centuries later was the ultimate turning point, bringing freedom to Crimea and Ukraine – a nation that had differentiated itself from Russia with European influence and ""national feelings,"" Satter said. The scholar explained that multiple treaties were signed with Ukraine, all of which validated the existing borders with Russia and Crimea. Meanwhile, the communist governments of former Eastern European satellite countries were overthrown and granted independence, including East Germany which was reunited with the west at the destruction of the Berlin Wall. - In this Friday, Nov. 10, 1989 file photo, hundreds of Berliners climb on top of the Berlin Wall at Brandenburg Gate in Berlin, demanding in a peaceful protest that the wall will be pulled down. The countries in the belt between Germany and Russia soon recognized their need to join , Satter said, as they stood vulnerable if Russia were to regain power again. ""Russia objected but the United States insisted that any country is free to join ,"" he said. ""That it’s a decision to be made by that country itself."" But, according to Satter, Russia was insistent about Ukraine not joining and would consider it a ""provocation"" if the union were to take place. allies began to back off from encouraging Ukraine and Georgia to join and even declined to extend an invitation to both countries at the Bucharest Summit in 2008.

""This was, to a certain extent, a reaction to Russian pressure - but the Russians reacted almost immediately with an invasion of Georgia,"" he said. ""Which could be interpreted to be a demonstration that made a mistake by not establishing a strong position that it would protect these countries against external aggression."" Since then, there have been no efforts to recruit Ukraine or Georgia as members; only efforts to uphold friendly relations with the United States. Satter explained that extending membership to Ukraine could be a possibility in the future, but ""nothing more."" ""And, in fact, nothing has changed recently,"" he said. ""There was no move, whatever to make Ukraine a member of at the time that Putin began making his threats."" Presently, Russia has built up its military at the Ukrainian border and has prepared necessary equipment for invasion. Even though the Ukrainians are determined to resist, if necessary, Putin’s position to launch a war is ""unpredictable,"" Satter said. Russian President Vladimir Putin attends a video call of the Capital ""Russia Calling!"" Investment Forum in Moscow, Russia, Tuesday, Nov. 30, 2021.

Leshan says things are much better organized, unlike in 2014. ""We saw in 2014 how small groups of Russian saboteurs, with the support of local provocateurs, took control of cities in the Donbas,"" Leshan recalled. ""This was because there was no active local armed force to protect the cities. Now this force will be in every region, in every district, in every city of Ukraine. ""We will protect critical infrastructure, city security from sabotage groups and pro-Russian forces, and we will also meet enemy regular forces and take the fight to enable the army to use reserves and hit the enemy. Territorial defense is an opportunity for everyone to take part in the defense of their land."" Leshan added that American support is vital. ""I'm sure Americans understand very well how important a free Ukraine is. It is important not only for the Ukrainian people, but also for the whole of Europe, and for the whole world,"" Leshan said. ""If Ukraine falls, it will be a tragedy for the Ukrainian people, and the balance in the world will also change in favor of the Russian archaic autocracy, and this is terrible, believe me. But I know that the Americans understand this. The volume of American military assistance is unprecedented, and the diplomatic support of Ukraine from the United States is also very large. Illia Rykov Illia Rykov : , , Observers say the civilian military units will play an important role against any Russian invasion with upwards of 130,000 Ukrainian volunteers to call upon from the pool of reserve forces. ""The war with the Russian Federation has been going on for eight years. We live in this state all the time"" says Illia Rykov, a 50-year-old businessman who is part of the volunteer forces. ""Almost every day we receive news about the injuries or deaths of our soldiers in the Donbas."" Rykov told Fox Digital he realized he had to do his part to help. ""I decided that not only our army could help stop the aggressor, but also citizens like me. I am not a military man, but I was ready to learn how to defend my family and country,"" said Rykov. Rykov joined the Ukrainian Legion In 2016, describing it as ""a civilian organization that has taken up training citizens in basic military skills. In 2017, I joined the territorial defense of the city of Kyiv. Today, for the sixth year in a row, I have been going through military training almost weekly on weekends."" 'S Rykov said he is very grateful for the support the U.S. has given Ukraine over the years. ""I want to thank the for the real help they have been providing to our country all these years,"" Rykov said. ""This is very important and valuable for us. ""We are ready to defend our country and our values, our desire for democracy and freedom. We are at war with the Russian Federation, which has one of the strongest armies in the world, whose state policy denies the very existence of the Ukrainian nation and Ukraine as a state. We believe in continued support from the U.S. government and the American people in our fight against the aggressor."" Oleksii Sannikov works in Ukraine’s industry by day. A father to a teenager, Sannikov runs an called the Ukrainian Legion, whose goal is to ""train ordinary Ukrainians in the art of civilian defense,"" he says. Oleksi Sannikov ""Our prepares civilians to act in some critical situations — and war it is just one case,"" Sannikov said. ""After our training, people can recognize if they want to build a military career."" He says the organization is a training platform for civilians, but says it may soon be officially recognized. ""According to new regulations, we can become a combat unit and an official part of forces of territory defense,"" he explained. He said his organization has about 450 members and has trained over 4000 civilians. He says he wants the American public to understand Ukrainians want to live separated from Russia. ""Not every brother is a good brother, you know,"" Sannikov said. ""We can live in peace, but they must forget about their desire to enslave us again."" He said he understood how difficut it will be ""to fight with Russia troops, but if will help us with some lethal weapon, and if you will close a sky, I suppose we will handle this situation."" Rykov and his band of brothers and sisters are far from being weekend warriors. He makes sure to point out that they are trained by former and current military personnel and says that several times each year they train with Ukrainian army units to gain additional skills and knowledge. ""As part of our training, we study combined arms disciplines, tactical medicine, topography and engineering training,"" Rykov explained. ""In addition to obtaining theoretical knowledge, we constantly work out these disciplines in practice during our trainings. ""In our ranks, there are people who fought in the Donbas as well as ordinary citizens of different ages, gender and professions. This is not a commercial initiative. We are engaged in voluntarily, without receiving remuneration."" Rykov and his colleagues are ready to fend off what they see as the Russia aggressor if an invasion comes. ""If there is a full-scale invasion the Russian Federation, I am ready to take up arms and go to defend my city and country,"" Rykov said. ""My family is here, my children were born here, my parents and friends live here. I have someone to protect."" The Associated Press contributed to this report.

In 2014, following the ouster of a Kremlin-friendly president in Ukraine, Moscow annexed the Crimean Peninsula and threw its weight behind a separatist insurgency in the country's industrial heartland in the east. The fighting between Ukrainian forces and Russia-backed rebels has since killed over 14,000 people, and efforts to reach a peaceful settlement of the conflict have stalled. In the latest standoff, Russia has demanded guarantees from the West that would never allow Ukraine to join and that the alliance would curtail other actions, such as stationing troops in former Soviet bloc countries.

2022-01-25,Fox,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/russia-ukraine-crisis-putin-dan-hoffman,Russia-Ukraine crisis already paying dividends for Putin,"Fox News contributor Dan Hoffman weighs in on rising tensions between Russia and Ukraine. If there is one thing I learned at it’s that the secret to unraveling what British Prime Minister Winston Churchill aptly described as the Russian ""riddle wrapped inside an enigma"" is deciphering what makes Vladimir Putin tick, or as his Russian comrades would say, """"чем человек дышит"", literally ""how does a person breathe."" Let’s consider the key questions first: Why did Putin choose this time deliberately to incite a crisis by menacingly deploying over 100,000 troops to Ukraine’s border? What does he expect to gain and what might he be risking? Trained in the art of cloak and dagger espionage, Putin served many years in the before the collapse of the Soviet Union and was later Director of Russia’s internal security police the . His goal is to remain in power and his tactics reflect those of a coldly calculating spy, who is exceptionally effective at ruthlessly exploiting his adversaries’ vulnerabilities. Vladimir President Vladimir Putin in Moscow, Russia, Tuesday, Jan. 25, 2022. The Kremlin’s chief adversary, to whom Putin and his coterie refer as the ""Main Enemy"", is the United States. Putin believes the U.S. –led alliance is an existential threat to his regime security not because of ’s ostensible military threat, which Putin purposely exaggerates, but because Western ideals of liberty, freedom, and democracy might spread to Russia and break Putin’s iron grip on the Russian state. Ukraine is in Putin’s crosshairs because nothing threatens Putin’s regime more than a democratic, prosperous neighbor with a sizeable Russian speaking population and commitment to membership in the European Union and . When the Biden administration stated its goal was to build a ""stable and predictable"" relationship with Russia, Putin saw a propitious opportunity to dial up the pressure on Ukraine and incite a crisis for which he alone is responsible. He might have concluded the Biden administration, which would not leave behind a few thousand troops to prevent Afghanistan from morphing into a terrorist state, was so preoccupied with its domestic agenda, that it would be willing to make concessions on Ukraine. ’S So Putin deliberately delivered the most unstable and unpredictable aggressive threats against Ukraine and is charging a hefty price to remove them. In the spirit of Soviet dictators under whom he served, Putin has made the most unrealistic demands with artificially imposed deadlines designed only to increase tension. Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg speaks to the press ahead of a meeting of Foreign Affairs Ministers to be held on Nov. 30-Dec.1, at the headquarters, in Brussels, Belgium, Friday, Nov. 26, 2021. The Biden administration should have expected nothing less from the Kremlin, which invaded and occupies Georgia; enjoys a strategic partnership with Iran; poisoned former Russian military intelligence officer Sergey Skripal and oppositionist Alexei Navalny with a banned chemical nerve agent; interfered in U.S. and European elections; and launched malicious cyber attacks on U.S. government, private sector and key infrastructure. The Ukraine crisis is already paying dividends for Putin. First, Putin has directed his state controlled media to portray Ukraine as such a significant threat, that Russia had no other choice but to deploy troops to the border. The reality is that is a defensive alliance and Russia is by far the strongest nation on the continent, with superior conventional and nuclear forces. Characterizing and Ukraine as Russia’s enemies, Putin can by extension attack within his own borders what threatens him most -- liberty, freedom, and democracy. Second, Putin has demonstrated is powerless to induce him to withdraw his troops, except on his own terms. Putin can continue to threaten Ukraine’s territorial integrity and sovereignty as long as he wishes. By demonstrating does not have the leverage to defend, deter, or counter the Kremlin’s malicious behavior, Putin is driving a wedge between the U.S. and Ukraine. Third, Putin has increased his domestic prestige by going toe to toe with Russia’s superpower rival and demonstrating he is still capable after two decades in power, of dealing ruthlessly with his domestic and foreign enemies. Having learned firsthand from the failed coup against Gorbachev that the most dangerous threats to an autocratic regime most often emerge from within, Putin knows he must evince not a hint of weakness, or risk an uprising from among even his most loyal followers.",29,2.9203125042585327,2.5245123351323735,0.39580016912615923,27

2022-01-21,Fox,https://www.foxnews.com/world/russian-threat-ukraine-push-finland-sweden-join-nato,"Russian threat to Ukraine could push Finland, Sweden to join NATO","Former Station Chief Dan Hoffman, Hudson Institute Senior Fellow Rebecca Heinrichs, and Senior Fellow at The Gatestone Institute Gordan Chang on the potential conflict. Russia’s military buildup along its border with Ukraine and the hostile rhetoric coming out of Moscow is making some of its regional neighbor’s rethink long-held post-World War security arrangements. Recent pronouncements coming from Finland and Sweden suggest the two countries are now more open to joining the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and will not back down in the face of threats from Russian President Vladimir Putin. The likelihood of a Russian invasion of Ukraine is growing daily, and yet the leaders of Finland and Sweden remain firm in defending their countries' interests against threats from Moscow. Finnish Prime Minister Sanna Marin affirmed Finland’s right to chart its own security posture. , In her New Year’s Eve speech to the nation, Prime Minister Marin declared ""We retain the option of applying for membership. We should uphold this freedom of choice and make sure it remains a reality, as this is part of every country’s right to decide on its own security policies."" Finland’s president, Sauli Niinisto, reinforced the prime minister’s sentiments in his own New Year’s Eve speech, saying ""let it be stated once again: Finland’s room to maneuver and freedom of choice also include the possibility of military alignment and of applying for membership, should we ourselves so decide."" Sweden’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Anne Linde also asserted that Russia does not have a veto on whatever alliance Sweden chooses to join. Defense Minister Peter Hultqvist backed up Linde and dismissed the notion that Russia has any say in Sweden’s security policies. Russian President Vladimir Putin gestures while speaking at an extended meeting of the Russian Defense Ministry Board at the National Defense Control Center in Moscow, Russia, Dec. 21, 2021. The possibility of Finland, a country with a history of not joining any military alliance, in Russia’s backyard joining clearly rattled Moscow, with the foreign ministry stating the possibility of Finland and Sweden joining ""would have serious military and political consequences that would require an adequate response from the Russian side."" Given the historical and political differences in relations with Russia, calls for possible membership are currently greater in Finland than they are in Sweden. The signals emanating from Finland on possible membership would be an unprecedented break from Helsinki’s post-World War international security policy that formed the bedrock of its Cold War foreign policy. Finland’s neutrality after World War was due to its precarious and unique geographic position as essentially a buffer between the communist East and democratic West in Europe. Finland shares a long border with Russia and was subjected to invasion during the Winter War of 1939-1940. Realizing its difficult strategic position between East and West and coming off the devastation of Soviet occupation, Finland pursued a policy of neutrality and did not join or any other military alliance during the Cold War. A Friendship Treaty was imposed on Finland in 1948 and the terms of the agreement were defined by the Soviet Union. The underlying agreement meant Finland accepted a certain level of Soviet influence over its international orientation, limiting its relations with the West. . . Finland’s acquiescence to Russian security concerns is precisely the guarantees Putin is looking for in its relations with Ukraine. Ukraine, which also borders Russia and had chunks of its territory annexed and occupied by Russian forces in 2014, has the long-term goal of joining in the hopes of staving off future Russian aggression. If Finland were to join the Atlantic Alliance, it would bring yet another Western-aligned country adjacent to Russia’s border, violating Russia’s core post-Cold War principle that would refrain from moving eastward and toward Russia. It’s this misunderstood notion that is at the crux of the modern conflict with Ukraine and other countries that seek protection. When Germany reunified in 1990 and the Soviet Union was on the cusp of collapse, the Soviets were looking for assurances from the United States that former Warsaw Pact countries would not join . President Putin claims the U.S. violated its pledge as began a steady stream of enlargement, starting with Hungary, Poland, and the Czech Republic in 1999. Further membership was extended in 2004 when Bulgaria, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia were admitted. At the 2008 Bucharest Summit, the alliance agreed that membership would be extended to Georgia and Ukraine. President Joe Biden and other heads of the states and governments pose for a family photo during the summit at the Alliance's headquarters, in Brussels, Belgium, Monday, June 14, 2021. The post-Cold War rounds of enlargement took place under conditions of unquestioned U.S. primacy and relative Russian economic weakness and international decline. Since Russia’s 2008 invasion of Georgia and the annexation of Crimea and occupation of the Donbas region of Ukraine in 2014, Russia has reasserted itself on the international stage and Putin has once again made clear to the West that Russia won’t tolerate eastward expansion. Alexander Stubb, who served as Prime Minister, Foreign Minister, and Finance Minister from 2008 to 2016 and now serves as Director of the School of Transitional Governance at the European University Institute, said that Finland should have joined in 1995. ""My personal opinion is that Finland should have joined in 1995, at the same time when we joined the E.U. My opinion has not changed. Now, it is more a question of timing. Finland’s military system is more compatible than those of some members. Negotiations are never a walk in the park, but in the case of Finland the membership track would be fast,"" former Prime Minister Stubbs told Fox News. Finland also deepened its cooperation with during that period without becoming a formal member. In 1994, Finland joined ’s Partnership for Peace program to enhance cooperation and dialogue between and non- member states. Finland also conducted regular exercises with forces and was an active contributor to many -led missions, including missions in Iraq and Afghanistan. If Finland were to formally take the leap and join , it would involve both benefits and costs for the country. ""What Finland would see as the most important benefit is the collective safety guarantee of that the European Union, in its present form, does not militarily provide,"" Laura Nordstrom, doctoral researcher at the University of Helsinki, told Fox News. With a revanchist and resurgent Russia threatening its neighbors, collective security guarantees from would lower the threat perception posed by Russia. The obvious costs for Finland would be worsening relations with Russia at a time when Moscow’s relations with the West are already frayed and at their worst point since the dark days of the Cold War. Such a move would cross Putin’s demands that halt any further eastward expansion. From the alliance’s perspective, full membership entails Finland enjoying the right to Article 5 collective self-defense, if Russia were to attack Finland, the alliance would be forced to respond and defend Finland. Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg speaks to the press ahead of a meeting of Foreign Affairs Ministers to be held on Nov. 30-Dec.1, at the headquarters, in Brussels, Belgium, Friday, Nov. 26, 2021. ) Former Prime Minister Stubbs said Russia’s recent hostility and blatant violation of international law and norms brings ’s mission back to its original Cold War mandate. ""It was created as a deterrent to the Soviet Union. Won the Cold War without firing a shot. Then had to do some soul-searching through crisis management. And now, with Russian aggression, has come back full circle to its origins. Hardly what the Kremlin had in mind,"" Prime Minister Stubbs told Fox News. With that in mind, it’s not entirely assured that Finland joining would pose as severe a threat to Russia as Ukraine or Georgia joining the alliance. ""Finland’s membership, already an E.U. member state and not an ex-Soviet country, would be seen less a problem for Russia. At least Russia has not indicated publicly that Finland would be an equal threat. But this is in the heart of the fears of the Finnish debate on the membership,"" Nordstrom said. Unlike Ukraine and Georgia, Finland was never incorporated into the Soviet Union and enjoys full membership in most Western institutions. Some in the foreign policy and international security world believe expansion, including Finland becoming a member state, is needlessly provocative at a moment when any escalatory move could lead to armed conflict. "" was created to counter the now defunct Soviet Union. A condition for ending the Cold War was for to desist gobbling up countries in Russia’s sphere of influence. Hawks want to pretend that Russia is not genuinely concerned by expansion, but this is not a serious argument,"" Max Abrahms, international security expert at Northeastern University, told Fox News. While expansion may be viewed by the West as purely defensive and in response to Putin’s latest machinations, Russia views it as an offensive maneuver that will challenge Moscow’s place in the world.",29,2.311730920031128,3.9491721703525378,-1.6374412503214097,18

U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov are meeting in Geneva, once a key Cold War crossroads, trying to avert a possible Russian invasion of Ukraine amid Moscow’s demands for concessions from over its relationship with the former Soviet republic. Blinken on Thursday played down any prospects of an immediate fix in the Geneva talks, which are set to run about two hours, saying resolving the difficult issues ""won’t happen quickly"" – and emphasizing that he doesn’t expect a resolution on Friday. Washington and its allies have repeatedly promised ""severe"" consequences such as biting economic sanctions — though not military action — against Russia if an invasion goes ahead by 100,000 Russian troops who have been positioned near the Ukrainian border for weeks. After meeting with Ukraine’s president in Kyiv and top diplomats from Britain, France and Germany in Berlin this week, Blinken was set for a face-to-face with Lavrov that is shaping up as a possible last-ditch effort at dialogue and a negotiated agreement — but both sides sticking to so-far-irreconcilable red lines. On Thursday in Berlin, Blinken warned of a ""swift, severe"" response from the U.S. and its allies if an invasion is launched, and the U.S. Treasury Department slapped new sanctions on four Ukrainian officials. Blinken said the four were at the center of a Kremlin effort begun in 2020 to damage Ukraine’s ability to ""independently function.""

Blinken took pains to stress U.S. unity with its allies in opposition to a possible Russian invasion — and tried to do just that Thursday, a day after U.S. President Joe Biden drew widespread criticism for saying retaliation for Russian aggression in Ukraine would depend on the details and that a ""minor incursion"" could prompt discord among Western allies. On Thursday, Biden cautioned that any Russian troop movements across Ukraine’s border would constitute an invasion and that Moscow would ""pay a heavy price"" for such an action. ""I’ve been absolutely clear with President Putin,"" Biden said. ""He has no misunderstanding: Any, any assembled Russian units move across the Ukrainian border, that is an invasion."" Russia has denied it is planning an invasion and instead accused the West on Thursday of plotting ""provocations"" in Ukraine, citing the delivery of weapons to the country by British military transport planes in recent days.

Donbas, located in eastern Ukraine, is under control of Russia-backed separatists who have fought Ukrainian forces for nearly eight years, a conflict that has killed more than 14,000 people. Ukraine said earlier this week that it has taken the delivery of anti-tank missiles from the U.K. It has rejected Moscow’s claims that it plans an offensive to reclaim control of separatist-held areas in the country’s eastern industrial heartland. Ukraine's government, the U.S. and its allies have expressed intensifying concerns in recent weeks over a Russian troop buildup near Ukraine. The concentration of an estimated 100,000 Russian troops near Ukraine has fueled Western fears that Moscow is poised to attack its neighbor. U.S. President Biden said Wednesday he thinks Russia will invade Ukraine and warned President Vladimir Putin that his country would pay a ""dear price"" in lives lost and a possible cutoff from the global banking system if it does. Moscow has repeatedly denied having plans to launch an offensive. But it has sought a set of security guarantees from the West that would exclude 's expansion to Ukraine and other ex-Soviet nations and the deployment of alliance weapons there. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the U.S. threat to cut off Russia from the global banking system could encourage hawkish forces in Ukraine to use force to reclaim control of the rebel east. ""It may implant false hopes in the hotheads of some representatives of the Ukrainian leadership who may decide to quietly restart a civil war in their country,"" Peskov said in a conference call with reporters. Washington and its allies firmly rejected Moscow’s demands in security talks last week but kept the door open to possible further talks on arms control and confidence-building measures to reduce the potential for hostilities. Amid the tensions, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken visited Ukraine Wednesday to reassure it of Western support. He traveled to Berlin on Thursday to meet with his British, French and German counterparts to discuss Ukraine and other security matters.

Instead, those meetings appear to have increased fears of a Russian invasion, and the Biden administration has accused Russia of preparing a ""false flag operation"" to use as a pretext for intervention. Russia has angrily denied the charge. Secretary of State Antony Blinken speaks in the briefing room of the State Department in Washington, Jan. 7, 2022. Blinken will visit Ukraine this week as tensions between the U.S. and Russia escalate over a possible Russian invasion of its neighbor.

""The trip follows extensive diplomacy with our European Allies and partners about a united approach to address the threat Russia poses to Ukraine and our joint efforts to encourage it to choose diplomacy and de-escalation in the interests of security and stability,"" the department said. On Monday, Russia’s top diplomat rejected the U.S. allegations that it was preparing a pretext to invade Ukraine. Speaking to reporters, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov dismissed the U.S. claim as ""total disinformation."" Lavrov reaffirmed that Russia expects a written response this week from the U.S. and its allies to Moscow’s request for binding guarantees that will not embrace Ukraine or any other ex-Soviet nations or station its forces and weapons there.

As part of the exercises to ""thwart and repel a foreign aggression,"" Russia will deploy a dozen Su-35 fighter jets and several air defense units to Belarus, Fomin said. He did not say how many troops and weapons were being redeployed for the exercises, or give the number of troops that will participate in the war games. The deployment would dramatically bolster an estimated 100,000 Russian troops with tanks and other heavy weapons amassed near Ukraine in what the West fears could be a prelude to an invasion. Russia has denied an intention to attack its neighbor but demanded guarantees from the West that will not expand to Ukraine or other ex-Soviet nations or place its troops and weapons there. Washington and its allies firmly rejected Moscow’s demands during Russia-U.S. negotiations in Geneva and a related -Russia meeting in Brussels last week. Fomin said the drills in Belarus, which involve moving an unspecified number of troops from Russia's Eastern Military District that encompasses Eastern Siberia and the Far East, reflect the need to practice concentrating the country's entire military potential in western Russia. ""A situation may arise when forces and means of the regional group of forces will be insufficient to ensure reliable security of the union state, and we must be ready to strengthen it,"" Fomin said at a meeting with foreign military attaches. ""We have reached an understanding with Belarus that it's necessary to engage the entire military potential for joint defense."" Belarus' authoritarian president, Alexander Lukashenko, said the joint maneuvers will be conducted on Belarus’ western border and also in the country’s south, where it borders Ukraine.

And the U.S. has expressed concern that Russia may prepare for an imminent invasion, with one official telling Fox News that Russia has already prepositioned a group of operatives to conduct a false-flag operation in eastern Ukraine to provide a pretext for invasion. Department of Defense press secretary John Kirby told reporters that ""It's too soon to say that it's part and parcel of a false flag"" operation. ""These were disruptive attacks, cyberattacks,"" Kirby explained. ""So I don't want to go there, but, again, this is a piece of the same kind of playbook we've seen from Russia in the past."" -19 This would follow the same pattern that preceded the 2014 invasion of Crimea, and the official said that Russia could start making accusations against Ukraine by mid-February. Last month, Moscow submitted draft security documents demanding that deny membership to Ukraine and other former Soviet countries and roll back the alliance’s military deployments in Central and Eastern Europe. Washington and its allies have refused to provide such pledges, but said they are ready for the talks. Sweden’s foreign minister, Ann Linde, said the west must stand up to any Russian aggression.

2022-01-10,Fox,https://www.foxnews.com/world/main-issues-russia-us-security-talks,Russia-US security talks present these main issues,"Russian diplomats are meeting this week with officials from the United States and its allies for security negotiations in three European cities. Russian and U.S. negotiators launched the talks in Geneva on Monday. They will be followed by Russia- talks in Brussels and a meeting in Vienna of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe over the course of the week. Here is a look at the agenda of the security talks and the main issues of contention: 10 Military vehicles and tanks of Poland, Italy, Canada and United States roll during the military exercises ''Namejs 2021'' at a training ground in Kadaga, Latvia, Sept. 13, 2021. The amassing of Russian troops and equipment near Ukraine’s border has caused worries in Kyiv and in the West that Moscow could be planning to launch an invasion. Moscow has denied such an intention and in turn accused Ukrainian authorities of planning an offensive to reclaim control over territories in eastern Ukraine held by Russia-backed separatists — allegations Ukraine has rejected. U.S. President Biden twice discussed the Russian troop buildup with Russian President Vladimir Putin last month, warning that Moscow would face ""severe consequences,"" including unprecedented economic and financial sanctions, if it attacked its neighbor. Russia annexed Ukraine’s Crimean Peninsula in 2014 and has backed the separatist rebellion that started the same year in the country’s east, where more than seven years of fighting has killed over 14,000 people. The West has responded with sanctions that have battered the Russian economy but failed to persuade Moscow to change course. ’S Putin has described the possibility of Ukraine joining and the alliance deploying weapons there as a ""red line"" for Moscow. The Kremlin demanded that Washington and its allies make a binding pledge excluding ’s expansion to Ukraine, Georgia or any other ex-Soviet nations. Moscow has also demanded that the U.S. and its allies make a commitment not to deploy weapons or conduct any military activities in Ukraine and other ex-Soviet nations. The Kremlin has presented a draft Russia-U.S. security treaty and a blueprint for a Russia- agreement as a starting point for this week’s negotiations. They would oblige the alliance not to station any troops in areas where they weren't present in 1997 — before moved to incorporate former Soviet bloc countries and ex-Soviet republics. Moscow’s proposals also suggest a freeze on patrols by Russian and U.S. naval ships and bombers near each other’s frontiers. In addition, they call for efforts to reduce the risk of incidents involving Russia and warships and aircraft, primarily in the Baltic and the Black Seas; a reduction in the scope of military drills; greater transparency and other confidence-building measures. U.S. The U.S. and its allies have roundly rejected the demand for not to admit Ukraine or any other new members, emphasizing that a key alliance principle is that membership is open to any qualifying country and no outsiders have veto power. While Ukraine and Georgia aren’t yet ready for membership and have little prospect of being invited to join soon, the Western allies insist that ’s doors must remain open to them. In 2008, promised to eventually embrace the two nations, although it hasn't offered them a specific road map to membership. Even though the allies firmly rejected a halt to ’s expansion as a nonstarter, Washington and say they are ready to discuss arms control, confidence-building measures, greater transparency and risk reduction if Russia takes a constructive stance. U.S. officials said they are open to discussions on curtailing possible future deployments of offensive missiles in Ukraine and putting limits on American and military exercises in Eastern Europe if Russia is willing to back off on Ukraine. At the same time, the White House has urged Russia to help create a positive environment for the upcoming talks by pulling back its troops from areas near Ukraine. Moscow has dismissed the suggestion, saying it can deploy its forces wherever it deems necessary on its own territory and describing the buildup as a response to ""hostile"" moves by . Putin has called the negotiations with the U.S. a ""positive"" move but said he wants quick results, warning the West against trying to drown Russia’s demands in ""idle talk."" Asked during a news conference last month if he could guarantee that Russia won't invade Ukraine, Putin responded angrily and said the West ""must give us guarantees and give them immediately, now."" Russian Deputy Foreign Minister and head of delegation Sergei Ryabkov attends a Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons conference in Beijing, China, Jan. 30, 2019. Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov, who heads the Russian delegation at the security talks, described the demand for guarantees that won't expand to Ukraine and other ex-Soviet nations as ""absolutely essential"" and warned that the U.S. refusal to discuss it would make further talks senseless. ""We are going there not with a hand outstretched but with a precisely formulated task that we need to solve on conditions that we formulated,"" Ryabkov said. He warned that Russia wouldn’t make any concessions under threats and pressure and noted that the talks may end after the first round if the U.S. and its allies are uncooperative The Kremlin’s blunt demands combined with a push for quick results have fueled U.S. suspicions that Moscow could make unrealistic requests just to see the talks collapse and then use it as a pretext for aggressive action. Russian diplomats have repudiated the claim. - While Moscow has denied planning to attack Ukraine, Putin has warned that he would be forced to take unspecified ""military-technical measures"" if the West stonewalled on his security demands. He didn't elaborate beyond saying the Russian response in that scenario ""could be diverse"" and ""will depend on what proposals our military experts submit to me."" Kremlin foreign policy adviser Yuri Ushakov said Putin had told Biden that Russia would act just as if the U.S. would have acted if it saw offensive weapons deployed next to its borders.

The launch of a salvo of Zircons in late December heralded the completion of tests for the new weapon, which Putin said flies at nine times the speed of sound to a range of more than 620 miles. While voicing concern that could potentially use Ukrainian territory for the deployment of missiles capable of reaching Moscow in just five minutes, Putin noted that Zircon would give Russia a similar capability.",29,1.6028544645398002,1.5202619605799441,0.08259250395985607,27

2021-12-28,Fox,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/russia-ukraine-putin-biden-nato-rebekah-koffler,Russia will strike Ukraine soon -- Putin is playing with Biden and NATO,"Former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo joined 'Sunday Morning Futures' to discuss the bilateral tension, warning Vladimir Putin will continue to push the U.S. as a result of 'weak leadership.' Do not be distracted by Russia’s announcement on Sunday of a troop withdrawal from the Ukrainian border. It may appear that Moscow is signaling, ahead of the just announced U.S.-Russia talks early next year, that it favors a diplomatic approach to resolving the current standoff with the U.S. and over Ukraine. But in all likelihood it is just a ruse. There’s a more than 50% chance that Putin will attack Ukraine in the coming weeks, regardless of the outcome of another round talks between Moscow and Washington planned for January 10 through 13. 10,000 Removing 10,000 troops from the region is more likely a redeployment rather than an actual withdrawal and does little to downgrade Russia’s battle-ready status. Putin has amassed up to 175,000 troops and a formidable arsenal of combat hardware in the area. By dialing up and down the war rhetoric and varying the force posture, Putin seeks to confuse Washington about his intentions in order to achieve tactical surprise when he launches his assault. The evidence Putin is about to act is overwhelming. Russian President Vladimir Putin addresses an extended meeting of the Russian Defense Ministry Board at the National Defense Control Center in Moscow, Russia, Tuesday, Dec. 21, 2021. The Russian president on Tuesday reiterated the demand for guarantees from the U.S. and its allies that will not expand eastward, blaming the West for current tensions in Europe. The Russian authoritarian provided justification for striking Ukraine during his speech to his Ministry of Defense and his four-hour press conference, last week. Members of his cabinet have mirrored Putin’s belligerent tone since. Putin likely calculates that the risk of taking over at least eastern Ukraine now is lower, during the Biden presidency and while Ukraine is not a member, than if he waited. , In his recent statements, Putin outlined the Kremlin’s concerns about Ukraine hosting offensive weapons systems if it becomes a member of the Alliance, an outcome Moscow views as an unacceptable threat to Russia’s security. On Sunday, Putin’s press secretary Dmitriy Peskov stated that ’s expansion aimed at incorporating Ukraine, Georgia, and Moldova, is a matter of Russia’s life or death. In an exclusive interview that aired on Russian state on Sunday, Putin said that Russia is being forced to say -- ""perhaps in an unusual way . . . stop!"" He added, ""We have been pinned down against the red lines."" That phrase invokes a legendary Russian World War rallying cry for the troops to defend the motherland before a bloody battle. He also said that there was ""nowhere to retreat."" Putin also said last Tuesday that even if Russia’s requirements for security guarantees are met, Russia cannot trust U.S. assurances. The Kremlin’s recently proposed U.S.-Russia treaty on security measures is full of un-meetable demands that intentionally violate the fundamentals of U.S. foreign policy, which seeks to prevent Russia from emerging as a rival power in Eurasia. Washington believes that post-Soviet states, such as Ukraine, have the right to develop as democracies, while Moscow views them as its security buffer and sphere of influence. 'T Putin is therefore building a case for taking action against Ukraine regardless of how the responds to his demands. ""We were lied to. Blatantly,"" Putin stated in his staged press conference with the Russian and foreign media. He insisted that there were five waves of expansion despite U.S. assurances that the Alliance will not move closer to Russia even ""an inch."" He said that Russia is fully justified in whatever action it takes because it is defending itself from . He later ruled out any compromises because the U.S., with its offensive strike weapons, is on ""Russia’s doorstep."" A - Putin likely is looking for a pretext to strike. In an unprecedented move, last week, Russian Defense Minister Shoigu accused the U.S. of preparing a provocation on Russian borders involving chemical weapons. On Christmas Eve, Moscow promptly accused Kiev of an ""act of terrorism"" after someone threw a Molotov cocktail bottle at the Russian consulate in Ukraine’s city of Lviv. On Monday, Russian Deputy Defense Minister General Fomin stated that was preparing for a large scale high intensity conflict with Russia. On the same day, Foreign Minister Lavrov accused the U.S. of trying to provoke a ""tiny war"" in Ukraine, in order to later blame Russia. Putin also seeks to secure his legacy as a modern ""Czar Vladimir"" who restored the Russian Empire. He reveres his namesake, medieval Grand Prince Vladimir, who brought Christianity in the 11th century to the first Slavic state, Kievan Rus, which included the principalities of Russia, Ukraine, and some other neighboring areas. Putin stated several times last Tuesday that Ukraine was never a separate country until it became one of the republics of the , in 1922. Having always decried the ’s collapse, Putin has a visceral Russian nationalist imperial streak and would accept a high risk to achieve his personal ambitions. Putin’s recent speeches resembled his address in the run-up to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine’s Crimea in March 2014. For example, he claimed then that Crimea was always an inseparable part of Russia, in people’s hearts and minds. This past July, he asserted that ""Russians and Ukrainians were one people – a single whole."" The Russian leader is obsessed with fear that the United States seeks Russia’s collapse — similar to the demise of the and believes he has a window of opportunity to act. He is worried that the risk of Kiev joining will increase if a stronger U.S. leader, and one not preoccupied with domestic upheaval and -19, comes to power. He also knows that the Pentagon is only beginning its transition from counter-terrorism operations onto a new footing focused on major states such as China and Russia. Russian troops are primed to fight in the cold, as they always have been, and Putin likely believes the West won’t wade into the snow to help Ukraine. Emboldened by his ability to blindside the West, such as by previously invading Georgia and taking Crimea, and by extorting concessions from Joe Biden, Putin is positioning to outmaneuver Washington. Regretfully, the Biden administration’s ""experts,"" like Obama’s before them who fecklessly sought a ""reset"" with Russia, are likely to fall into Putin’s trap.",29,3.2447536898310343,2.473266552896599,0.7714871369344354,27

2021-12-23,Fox,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/biden-harris-space-failures-us-risk-robert-walker-newt-gingrich,Biden-Harris' space failures – here's how admin putting US at risk,"Vice chief of space operations for the U.S. Space Force, Gen. David Thompson, joined 'Fox News Sunday' to discuss China's role in space, urging the U.S. to 'adapt its approach.' When the news media reports that a U.S. Space Force general is saying our space-based assets are under attack daily by China and Russia, it should be a cause for alarm. Those assets are essential to the present American way of life and our ability to defend it. The White House is quite aware of this threat, having been fully briefed by the national military space leadership about the extensive space weaponry capabilities of our adversaries. Moreover, the White House also was given a clear look at what is needed to address the threat posed by China and Russia. Reportedly, the second part of the briefing was answered with a statement indicating that none of the suggested American counter-weaponry was going to be approved. ""We are not going to be the first administration to militarize space"" was the specific response. 'S Leaving aside the reality that space is already a warfare domain, doubts can be raised about the unverifiable comments in this confidential meeting. But what cannot be ignored is the now obvious fact that the Joe Biden-Kamala Harris administration is not prepared to prioritize needed military space options The first meeting of the National Space Council horrified much of the space defense community. Vice President Harris, the chair of the council, announced that the three top space priorities of this administration would be climate change, promoting rules and norms for governing space activities, and building a U.S. workforce in science, technology, engineering and mathematics . What also should be noted about the announced space priorities of the Biden-Harris administration is their focus on looking down from space rather than looking outward into space. Each of these issues is a worthwhile pursuit, but they do not come close to the existential threat posed by our enemies to our way of life. Punctuating the Space Priorities Framework focus announced at the council meeting was a speech by Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin titled ""The China Challenge."" In the speech the secretary acknowledged the Chinese advances in hypersonics, nuclear weapons and cyberwarfare, all of which are space-related dangers. But his message was that we should not over-hype those threats. Yet, at the same forum, Space Force Vice Chief of Operations Gen. David Thompson said China, within this decade, could exceed U.S. military capabilities. Both men were clear about the challenge the Chinese pose, but the difference in emphasis between the political leadership and the military leadership was notable. What also should be noted about the announced space priorities of the Biden-Harris administration is their focus on looking down from space rather than looking outward into space. Their goal of reliance on more commercial space capabilities, mitigating space debris, space situational awareness and traffic management, and working closely with our allies are all positive initiatives. But our adversaries are looking beyond Low Earth Orbit domination and preparing to occupy cislunar space, beat the U.S. to human habitation on the Moon, and build technologies that will permit them to go to Mars. The technologies needed to do those things, such as nuclear power for surface applications and space vehicle propulsion, will define space leadership of the future and, like space programs of the past, will achieve earthbound technological and economic breakthroughs. We are also working on similar technologies, but evidently not at a pace that would match the China-Russia efforts. Nothing in the Space Priorities Framework indicates a quickening of that pace. Concentrating on looking down rather than looking up will give our adversaries reason to think that we are not prepared to commit to the kind of effort that would dissuade them. Speaking at the International Churchill Society in 2009, Richard Langford quoted Winston Churchill’s biographer, Martin Gilbert, as writing that Churchill saw the policies of Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin in the 1930s, especially with regard to the Royal Air Force expansion, as having given Hitler the impression, first, that Britain would not stand up to aggression beyond its borders and second, that if war came, Britain would not be in a position to act effectively even to defend its own cities. After seeing the space priority messages of the Biden-Harris administration, many in the space community are wondering if China and Russia are not now making the same kind of calculations.

He argued that Western weapons could encourage hawkish forces in Ukraine to attempt to regain control over Russia-backed separatist regions by force and even try to reclaim Crimea, which Russia annexed from Ukraine in 2014. The Russian leader claimed that Western expressions of concern about an alleged Russian invasion could be a prelude to a possible attempt by Ukraine to launch an offensive against the rebels in the east following two botched attempts in the past.

Russian President Vladimir Putin's speech at a meeting with Russia's top military brass came just days after Moscow submitted draft security documents demanding that deny membership to Ukraine and other former Soviet countries and roll back the alliance’s military deployments in Central and Eastern Europe – bold ultimatums that are almost certain to be rejected. The demands – contained in a proposed Russia-U.S. security treaty and a security agreement between Moscow and – were drafted amid soaring tensions over a Russian troop buildup near Ukraine that has stoked fears of a possible invasion. Russia has denied it has plans to attack its neighbor but pressed for legal guarantees that would rule out expansion and weapons deployment there. Russian President Vladimir Putin addresses the Russian Defense Ministry Board at the National Defense Control Center in Moscow, Russia, Tuesday, Dec. 21, 2021. Putin charged Tuesday that if U.S. and missile systems appear in Ukraine, it will take those missiles only minutes to reach Moscow.

Putin noted that has expanded eastward since the late 1990s while giving assurances that Russia’s worries were groundless. ""What is happening now, tensions that are building up in Europe, is their fault every step of the way,"" the Russian leader said. ""Russia has been forced to respond at every step. The situation kept worsening and worsening, deteriorating and deteriorating. And here we are today, in a situation when we're forced to resolve it somehow."" Russia’s relations with the U.S. sank to post-Cold War lows after it annexed the Crimean Peninsula from Ukraine in 2014 – gaining control over long coastlines of the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov – and backed a separatist insurgency in eastern Ukraine that still controls territory there. Tensions reignited in recent weeks after Moscow massed tens of thousands of troops near Ukraine’s border. President Vladimir Putin noted that has expanded eastward since the late 1990s while giving assurances that Russia’s worries were groundless. Putin has pressed the West for guarantees that will not expand to Ukraine or deploy its forces there and raised the issue during a video call with U.S. President Biden two weeks ago. Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu charged Tuesday that more than 120 staff of U.S. private military companies are currently operating in two villages in war-torn eastern Ukraine, training Ukrainian troops and setting up firing positions in residential buildings and different facilities. Putin said the U.S. ""should understand we have nowhere to retreat.""

Mitrofanov, principal investigator of the neutron telescope, is also the lead author of the research, published online on Nov. 19 in the journal Icarus. He and his colleagues analyzed observations ranging from May 2018 to February of this year, which mapped the hydrogen content of the soil by detecting neutrons rather than light. The process brings higher spatial resolution than previous measurements. The area is about the size of the Netherlands, according to the , and overlaps with the deep valleys of a site called Candor Chaos.

The threat of an invasion will be the central subject of President Biden’s video call with Putin on Tuesday. Biden is expected to warn of dire consequences should Russia follow through with a military offensive, while Putin is expected to reiterate his ultimatum that should not allow Ukraine to join its military alliance. The outcome of the video call could have major implications as Putin weighs the potential costs of a full-fledged invasion of Ukraine.

Ukraine and the West accused Russia of sending its troops and weapons to back the rebels. Moscow denied that, charging that Russians who joined the separatists were volunteers. In Wednesday's address to parliament, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called for negotiations with Russia to end the conflict in the east. ""We must tell the truth — we wouldn't be able to stop the war without direct talks with Russia,"" Zelenskyy said. ""We aren't afraid of a direct dialogue."" The Kremlin responded by reaffirming its long-held stance that Russia isn't a party to the conflict, describing the fighting in the east as a civil war. ""The war in Donbas is Ukraine's internal business,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters. ""We know about the attempts to cast Russia as a party to the conflict, but it's not so. It's only possible to end the war in Donbas through talks between Ukrainians."" Peskov said the Ukrainian troop concentration in Donbas could herald an attempt by Kyiv to reclaim control of the rebel-held territory.",29,3.2506429011778852,3.506083303855087,-0.2554404026772019,27

Commenting on Western concerns about Russia's alleged intention to invade Ukraine, he said that Moscow is equally worried about drills near its borders. Speaking to participants of an online investment forum, the Russian president said that 's eastward expansion has threatened Moscow's core security interests. He expressed concern that could eventually use the Ukrainian territory to deploy missiles capable of reaching Russia's command centers in just five minutes. A - Russian President Vladimir Putin attends a video call of the Capital ""Russia Calling!"" Investment Forum in Moscow, Russia, Tuesday, Nov. 30, 2021. ""The emergence of such threats represents a ‘red line’ for us,"" Putin said. ""I hope that common sense and responsibility for their own countries and the global community will eventually prevail."" He added that Moscow has been forced to counter the growing threats by developing new hypersonic weapons. ""What should we do?"" Putin said. ""We would need to develop something similar to target those who threaten us. And we can do that even now."" He said a new hypersonic missile that is set to enter service with the Russian navy early next year would be capable of reaching targets in comparable time. ""It would also need just five minutes to reach those who issue orders,"" Putin said. The Zircon hypersonic cruise missile, capable of flying at nine times the speed of sound to a range of 620 miles, has undergone a series of tests, most recently Monday. Ukrainian and Western officials have expressed worries this month that a Russian military buildup near Ukraine could signal plans by Moscow to invade its ex-Soviet neighbor. foreign ministers warned Russia on Tuesday that any attempt to further destabilize Ukraine would be a costly mistake. The Kremlin has insisted it has no such intention and has accused Ukraine and its Western backers of making the claims to cover up their own allegedly aggressive designs. Russia annexed Ukraine’s Crimean Peninsula in 2014 after the country’s Kremlin-friendly president was driven from power by mass protests and also threw its weight behind a separatist insurgency that broke out in Ukraine’s east. Earlier this year, a spike in cease-fire violations in the east and a Russian troop concentration near Ukraine fueled war fears, but tensions abated when Moscow pulled back the bulk of its forces after maneuvers in April. Putin argued that to avoid tensions, Russia and the West should negotiate agreements that would take the parties’ security interests into account. The Russian leader noted that Russia has been strongly worried about 's drills near its borders, pointing at a recent exercise that involved U.S. strategic bombers. ""Strategic bombers, which carry precision weapons and are capable of carrying nuclear weapons, were flying as close as 20 kilometers to our border,"" he said. ""That represents a threat for us."" The previous buildup of Russian troops near Ukraine early this year was followed by Putin's summit with U.S. President Biden in June in Geneva, where they agreed to launch a dialogue on strategic stability and cyber security. Putin hailed the discussions on cyber security between Russian and U.S. experts, saying ""just as with the pandemic, it's necessary to pool efforts to work efficiently."" Asked about Biden's bid to seek a second term, Putin hailed it, saying it would help the U.S. political stability. Russian President Vladimir Putin attends a video call of the Capital ""Russia Calling!"" Investment Forum in Moscow, Russia, Tuesday, Nov. 30, 2021. The Russian leader also drew a parallel with his own reelection plans, saying that even though he hasn't decided yet whether to seek reelection when his current six-year term ends in 2024, the possibility of him staying on has helped stability. The 69-year-old Russian president has been in power for more than two decades — longer than any other Kremlin leader since Soviet dictator Josef Stalin. Constitutional amendments approved in 2020 reset Putin’s previous term limits, allowing him to run for president two more times and hold onto power until 2036.",29,3.422505547343869,2.4722393140489727,0.9502662332948963,27

2021-11-26,Fox,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/russia-attack-ukraine-winter-biden-putin-robert-maginnis,Why it's better than a 50-50 chance that Russia will attack Ukraine this winter,"Fox News' foreign correspondent has the latest on the tensions between Russia and Ukraine as an estimated 100,000 Russian troops gather at the border The director of Ukraine’s defense agency anticipates Russian forces now amassed with hundreds of heavy fighting vehicles parked near the Russia-Ukraine border will attack by the end of January or early February 2022, according to the Military Times. The only question is when and that decision comes down to the Russian president’s calculation of what President Joe Biden and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization might do in response. Russian President Vladimir Putin has taken a measure of Biden and found him weak. Besides, the recent trip to Ukraine by Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin restirred calls for the government in Kiev to join , something Putin swears will never happen. A 2022 To put a stop to Kiev’s rush to membership Putin is readying his forces to attack this winter. That assault is likely to involve airstrikes, artillery and armor formations assisted by a deep penetration inside Ukraine by airborne forces and amphibious assaults into the critical ports of Odessa and Mariupul. But first anticipate a feint from Belarus toward Poland to draw ’s attention away from Ukraine accompanied by some nuclear saber-rattling in the Baltic region. Earlier this fall Russia’s large-scale Zapad 21 military exercise in Belarus was a rehearsal for the possible coming Ukraine invasion. That exercise dropped 3,500 airborne troops with special operators, a necessary strategic step to soften the enemy’s rear area to ensure success of massed armor formations crossing the international border. Ukraine’s defense minister Oleksii Reznikov admitted the timing of any invasion remains unclear and that Putin has not as yet decided but it’s clear the Russians are rapidly building capacity to do so. They have significant forces, including tens of thousands of reservists called up in recent months, weapons platforms to include Iskandar short-range ballistic missile systems and other long-range weapons at the Ukraine border region. Significant publicly available satellite imaginary testifies to these massed Russian forces and their offensive equipment. Biden is weak in the eyes of Putin and we can thank the sad U.S. military withdrawal fiasco from Afghanistan for fueling the Russian’s thinking. Of course, any attack will likely follow the scenario seen with Moscow’s 2008 invasion of the Republic of Georgia and after the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi when Russian forces took Crimea and sparked the ongoing insurgency in Ukraine’s east. Each of those advances began with Russian forces launching a series of psychological operations and cyber-attacks. A similar scenario is already in motion across Ukraine. Ukraine’s head of intelligence, Brig. Gen. Kyrylo Budanov, admitted ""They [the Russians] want to foment unrest, through protests and meetings, that show the people are against the government,"" an obvious justification for ""Mother Russia"" to rush to the rescue of its former satellite as it did in the Republic of Georgia and Crimea. Budanov identified a recent example of Russian-created unrest inside Ukraine. He fingered the Russian-created anti-Ukraine sentiment attributed to the incident labeled ""Wagnergate,"" a controversy involving scores of Russian mercenaries hired by a Russian oligarch friend of Putin responsible for attacks inside Ukraine. It’s noteworthy we’ve seen the Wagner Group doing Putin’s bidding inside Syria, in several African countries and even elsewhere in Eastern Europe. Will Putin attack Ukraine this winter? I give it a better than 50-50 chance. Why? Biden is weak in the eyes of Putin and we can thank the sad U.S. military withdrawal fiasco from Afghanistan for fueling the Russian’s thinking. Further, the time is ripe for a foreign distraction because Biden is unpopular at home, he has many domestic challenges and a pesky congressional election in November 2022 that could result in his party losing both the Senate and the House of Representatives. Further, Putin sees that his ally Chinese President Xi Jinping has a similar view about weak Biden, which explains China’s military build-up across the Taiwan Strait and the possible coming take-down of democratic Taiwan. Clearly the domestic and geopolitical challenges are mounting for the Biden administration, a true test of his foreign policy mettle. I have serious doubts Biden and his administration are up to the task of discouraging the likes of Putin and Xi from taking bold action to recover lands they long-ago claimed are theirs.",14,4.56679409610509,4.290322016411346,0.2764720796937441,13

""That poses a real threat of possibly being able to win a war with a single blow by means of an attack,"" Peter Vincent Pry, the executive director of the Task Force on National and Homeland Security, said during a virtual forum hosted by the Universal Peace Federation Tuesday. ""Moreover … they don’t envision employing an by itself. It would be used in conjunction with cyberattacks and physical sabotage, and non-nuclear ."" The U.S. electric grid and other infrastructure – such as communications and transportation systems and water and sewer services – could all be devastated by such an attack, experts like Pry warn, noting that time is of the essence for the U.S. to defend itself. Chinese President Xi Jinping U.S. 'S China already possesses ""super s"" and last summer tested a new hypersonic glide vehicle that analysts warn could deploy the and cause a long-lasting blackout that would shut down key infrastructure and cripple the military's ability to communicate.

""It’s bloodless, at least initially,"" said Plamen Doynov, a professor at the University of Missouri-Kansas City and chief technology officer at the company Shield.

If China or any other adversary such as Russia were to successfully cause a large scale blackout, Pry warns that there is little the U.S. could do in response. While the U.S. possesses the technology and capability to defend the nation's infrastructure from such an attack, deploying it across a country that has several different state agencies and utility companies responsible for the grid will be a challenge.

Microsoft said it discovered the campaign ""during its early stages"" and said it is sharing developments to cloud service resellers, technology providers and customers to take ""timely steps to help ensure Nobelium is not more successful."" Microsoft said that the attacks on this sector of the global supply chain have been a part of a ""larger wave"" of Nobelium activities over the summer. Burt said that between July 1 and Oct. 19, Microsoft informed 609 customers that they had been attacked 22,868 times by Nobelium, with a success rate in the low single digits. ""By comparison, prior to July 1, 2021, we had notified customers about attacks from all nation-state actors 20,5000 over the past three years,"" Burt wrote. Microsoft warned, though, that the activity is ""another indicator that Russia is trying to gain long-term, systematic access to a variety of points in the technology supply chain and establish a mechanism for surveilling--now or in the future--targets of interest to the Russian government."" Microsoft, detailing the attacks, explained that they do not appear to be an attempt to ""exploit any flaw or vulnerability in software"" but rather the utilization of ""well-known techniques, like password spray and phishing, to steal legitimate credentials and gain privileged access."" Microsoft said that the company ""can now provide actionable information which can be used to defend against this new approach."" Microsoft said it has been coordinating with others in the security community and has been ""working closely with government agencies in the U.S. and Europe."" ""While we are clear-eyed that nation-states, including Russia, will not stop attacks like these overnight, we believe steps like the cybersecurity executive order in the U.S., and the greater coordination and information sharing we’ve seen between industry and government in the past two years, have put us all in a much better position to defend against them,"" Burt wrote. ‘ ’ ‘’ Meanwhile, a senior administration official explained that the activities Microsoft described taking place were ""unsophisticated password spray and phishing attempts for the purpose of surveillance that cybersecurity experts say are attempted every day by Russia and other foreign governments and have been for years."" The official said these types of attempts can be prevented if cloud service providers implement ""baseline"" cybersecurity practices, including multi-factor authentication —a measure to require users to authenticate their accounts with more than a password. ""Broadly speaking, the federal government is aggressively using our authorities to protect the Nation from cyber threats, including helping the private sector defend itself through increased intelligence sharing, innovative partnerships to deploy cybersecurity technologies, bilateral and multilateral diplomacy, and measures we do not speak about publicly for national security reasons,"" the official told Fox News. Earlier this year, the Biden administration imposed sanctions on Russia for the SolarWinds computer hack, which began in 2020 when malicious code was snuck into updates to popular software that monitors computer networks of businesses and governments. The malware, affecting a product made by the American SolarWinds, gave elite hackers remote access into an organization's networks so they could steal information. - ; Earlier this month, Biden hosted virtual meetings with more than 30 countries to ""accelerate cooperation to counter ransomware,"" but the White House did not extend the invitation to Russia, senior administration officials said. The officials noted that the United States and the Kremlin have a ""separate channel"" where they ""actively"" discuss the matter. Officials said the president established a U.S.-Russia experts group for the U.S. to engage ""directly"" on the issue of ransomware. ""We do look to the Russian government to address ransomware criminal activity coming from actors within Russia,"" an official said, adding that the Biden administration has ""also shared information with Russia regarding criminal ransomware activity being conducted from its territory."" ""We’ve seen some steps by the Russian government, and are looking to see follow up actions and broader international cooperation is an important line of effort, because these are transnational criminal organizations,"" an official said, adding that they ""leverage global infrastructure and money laundering networks to carry out their attacks."" Biden, during his summit in Geneva with Russian President Vladimir Putin in June, raised the issue of ransomware. At the time, Biden said he told Putin that ""certain critical infrastructure should be off limits to attack."" Biden said he gave a list of ""16 specific entities defined as critical infrastructure,"" saying it ranged from energy to water systems. Putin, though, during his press conference after the meeting, denied that Russia was responsible for cyberattacks and instead claimed that the most cyberattacks in the world were carried out from the U.S. Also over the summer, the president signed a national security memo directing his administration to develop cybersecurity performance goals for critical infrastructure in the United States — entities like electricity utility companies, chemical plants and nuclear reactors. Meanwhile, the National Counterintelligence and Security Center last week announced it is prioritizing industry outreach efforts in U.S. technology sectors where the stakes are ""potentially greatest"" for U.S. economic and national security, warning of ""nation-state threats"" posed by China and Russia. 'S , ' ' , The warned that the Kremlin ""is targeting U.S. advances through the employment of a variety of licit and illicit technology transfer mechanisms to support national-level efforts, including its military and intelligence programs."" officials warned that Russia is also ""increasingly looking to talent recruitment"" and international scientific collaborations to ""advance"" their domestic research and development efforts. said, though, that its ""resource constraints"" have forced the Kremlin to focus on ""indigenous"" research and development efforts, such as Russian military applications of artificial intelligence. warned that Russia uses intelligence services, academics, joint ventures and business partnerships, talent recruitment, foreign investments, government-to- government agreements and more to acquire U.S. technologies.

""The Russians under Putin like to be unpredictable. They don't seem to care one bit about stability if it gets in the way of trying to dominate their neighbors,"" says Vershbow, adding that Moscow’s decision to suspend its mission could have been influenced by Austin’s visit.

The former top U.S. Army commander in Europe, retired Lieutenant General Ben Hodges, blames years of naivete: ""My biggest concern is that we, the West, still find it hard to believe that Russia has bad intentions.

For Hodges, Russia's actions are not isolated events in a vacuum, but part of bigger plans. He says Russia invaded Crimea because, ""Crimea is the platform for all of the malign influence they export around the Black Sea region, but especially down into Syria."" Hodges hopes the 2030 strategic concept that is working toward will be different from the one ""where we thought Russia was going to be a partner.""

Speaking at a pre-flight news conference Monday, 37-year-old Peresild acknowledged that it was challenging for her to adapt to the strict discipline and rigorous demands during the training. ""It was psychologically, physically and morally hard,"" she said. ""But I think that once we achieve the goal, all that will seem not so difficult and we will remember it with a smile."" Shipenko, 38, who has made several commercially successful movies, also described their fast-track, four-month preparation for the flight as tough.

Prosecutors believe there is sufficient evidence to charge Denis Sergeev, who went by the alias ""Sergey Fedotov,"" with conspiracy to murder, attempted murder, possessing and using a chemical weapon, and causing grievous bodily harm, according to London's Metropolitan Police force. Former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter, Yulia, were targeted in a nerve agent attack in March 2018 in the English city of Salisbury. British authorities say the poisoning had almost certainly been approved ""at a senior level of the Russian state."" Moscow has vehemently denied the allegations. This is a photo provided by the Metropolitan Police on Tuesday, Sept. 21, 2021 of Sergey Fedotov. , : The Skripals survived, but the attack later claimed the life of a British woman and left a man and a police officer seriously ill. Police previously charged two other Russian military intelligence agents, known by the aliases Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov, saying they traveled to the U.K. for the poisoning operation and then flew back to Moscow. Russian President Vladimir Putin has claimed the suspects were civilians, and the two men appeared on Russian television claiming they had visited Salisbury as tourists. Police said Tuesday they have evidence that the third suspect, Sergeev, was also a member of the Russian military intelligence service known as the . Arrest warrants have been issued for all three men. Police said they will apply for Interpol notices for Sergeev on Tuesday, but British prosecutors said they will not apply to Russia for his extradition because the Russian constitution does not permit extradition of its own nationals. A spokesman for Prime Minister Boris Johnson acknowledged that ""any formal extradition request is futile"" while the suspects remain in Russia. ""Should any of these individuals ever travel outside Russia, we will work with our international partners and take every possible step to detain and extradite them to face justice,"" Home Secretary Priti Patel told Parliament members Tuesday. Skripal, a Russian military intelligence officer turned double agent for Britain, and his daughter, who was visiting him in England, spent weeks in critical condition after the attack. - In this Wednesday, March 7, 2018 file photo, police officers guard a cordon around a police tent covering the the spot where former Russian double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter were found critically ill. Three months after the pair fell sick, two local residents who apparently picked up a discarded perfume vial that contained the nerve agent fell ill. One recovered, but the other died. A police officer who was investigating the case also fell ill; he recovered but later quit the force. The case ignited a diplomatic confrontation in which hundreds of envoys were expelled by both Russia and Western nations. Russia's Foreign Ministry said Tuesday that Britain continued to use the Skripal case to ""fuel anti-Russian sentiment in British society."" ""We strongly condemn all attempts by London to hold Moscow responsible for what happened in Salisbury and insist on a professional, objective and impartial investigation of the incident,"" Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova told reporters. 250 ’ : Zakharova said Russia was prepared to cooperate with British law enforcement but London rejected the idea of a joint investigation. A senior British counterterrorism officer who has been leading the investigation, Deputy Assistant Commissioner Dean Haydon, said investigators have pieced together evidence suggesting that all three suspects ""previously worked with each other and on behalf of the Russian state as part of operations carried out outside of Russia."" ""All three of them are dangerous individuals,"" he said. ""They have tried to murder people here in the U.K, and they have also brought an extremely dangerous chemical weapon into the U.K. by means unknown."" Haydon appealed for anyone who saw the three Russians in the U.K. in March 2018 to come forward. Online investigative website Bellingcat previously reported that Sergeev was a high-ranking officer and a graduate of Russia's Military Diplomatic Academy. The website said he was suspected of involvement in the poisoning of an arms manufacturer, his son and a factory manager in Bulgaria in 2015. Christo Grozev, an investigative journalist with Bellingcat, told the Associated Press on Tuesday that Sergeev appeared to have played a ""coordinating, supervising"" role in the Salisbury poisoning.",3,3.635746425136965,5.410122895848705,-1.77437647071174,5
2021-09-11,Fox,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/remembering-and-fearing-9-11-here-in-kiev-ukraine,"Remembering and fearing 9/11 here in Kiev, Ukraine","There is a slow moving 9/11 developing here in Ukraine, a threat that if mishandled could produce death and destruction equal to or greater than what the United States endured, and the world witnessed in horrified shock and disbelief twenty years ago. So concluded many participants at a gathering of former heads of state, current political leaders, historians, and journalists at a conference here in Kiev organized by Victor Pinchuk and the Yalta European Strategy group he founded 17 years ago. References to 9/11 were often heard at this two-day gathering – one of the first such summits since Europe has slowly emerged from the protracted pandemic-induced lockdown that has put foreign travel off-limits to all but the vaccinated and concern about emerging new virus variants palpable. In this file photo dated Monday, Dec. 9 2019, a Ukrainian soldier takes position on the front line at the town of Novoluhanske in the Donetsk region, Ukraine. . $1M , The tone of apprehension about this country’s future was set at the start of the two-day meeting by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who warned that he could not exclude the possibility of a full-scale war with Russia, even as he tries to negotiate a peace agreement with the Kremlin to end fighting in two eastern regions and the occupation of part of his country. When asked about the likelihood of a full-scale war with Russia, Zelensky said that although it would be ""the worst thing"" that could happen to a nation that has endured more than its share of catastrophes, he could not rule it out. ""There is such a possibility,"" he said, adding that such a move by Russia would be Moscow’s ""biggest mistake."" Ukrainians have been on edge for months since the Kremlin amassed more than 100,000 troops on its border in the occupied territory of Crimea, which Russian-backed forces invaded in 2014. So far, over 13,200 Ukrainians have died and some two million people have been displaced in the low-intensity war. Growing concern about its ally America’s lack of ""strategic patience"" and growing isolationism were also among the gatherings’ main themes. America’s shambolic departure from Afghanistan – its betrayal of the Afghan government in negotiations with the extremist Taliban, its failure to consult with its allies about the decision to leave by September 11, its unwillingness to take sufficient time and effort to extract not only Americans but the thousands of Afghans who had worked with U.S. troops and officials, and the military’s abandonment of weapons that have now made the Taliban the world’s best armed insurgents – were the formal and informal corridor talk of the informal summit. Ukrainian spirits were somewhat lifted by President Zelensky’s first meeting with President Joe Biden in Washington on September 1st, an official visit with an American president that he had been seeking since his election in 2019. Washington agreed to give Ukraine a $60 million increase in military aid, which brings total American aid for this year to over $400 million. , - 9/11 While Alexander Vershbow, a former U.S. ambassador to Russia who is attending the meeting, called the military aid a ""good package,"" he said he thought that the crisis between Russia and Ukraine, and the danger of a full-scale invasion merited a ""larger U.S. commitment."" Although Washington has been Kiev’s largest single foreign supplier of military aid, the Ukrainian government has been seeking to deter Russia and integrate more firmly with the West by joining the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the European Union. While both Washington and members have expressed support for Ukrainian membership, they have set conditions that make such membership extremely unlikely anytime soon. Several Ukrainian officials and conference participants expressed concern that America’s chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan might embolden Russian President Vladimir Putin, a former official who is exquisitely sensitive to what he perceives as weakness in rivals and foes. ""Putin will see American withdrawal as a success,"" Dmytro Kuleba, Ukraine’s Minister of Foreign Affairs, told me. ""Afghanistan is not Ukraine,"" he added. ""But think of what we would have done with the military aid and support that Washington gave Kabul."" Some of President Zelensky’s remarks, too, also echoed a sense of abandonment and a widespread conclusion that Ukraine was being insufficiently supported by America and the West. The world’s and the West’s failure to unite in the face of the deadliest pandemic in modern times, he said, led him to conclude that in a battle with a virus or Russian -backed separatists, his country would be on its own. In such crises, he said, ""it’s every man for himself.""",29,4.697540046158069,5.593313053288796,-0.8957730071307264,27

The ""unplanned restart"" of the module’s engines inadvertently moved the entire out of position for 47 minutes, according to . During a livestream of the event, Mission Control in Houston said that had ""temporarily lost orientation control as the result of inadvertent thrust firings"" and that the error had knocked the station of alignment by ""about 45 degrees."" later tweeted that Mission Control and the crew aboard the station had corrected the orientation and all systems were operating normally. The has to be oriented precisely in order for its solar panels and radio equipment to work properly – and the station lost contact with ground control twice during the incident. 'S – ""The crew was never in any danger,"" the space agency later tweeted. However, Dr. Jonathan McDowell, a leading space expert at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics expressed some concern about the safety of the astronauts in orbit. ""’The crew were never in any danger’ ... I'm not convinced they understand the issue well enough to be able to say that right now,"" he wrote. ""This is the sort of thing that in my opinion could - if handled wrongly - lead to loss of the station."" Authorities did not immediately have an explanation as for why the engines turned on but said flight controllers overcame the situation by using thrusters on other Russian station components to counteract the rogue engines.

2021-07-26,Fox,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/russian-cyber-weapons-waging-war-american-minds,Book Excerpt: Russian cyber weapons are waging war on US networks and American minds,"Former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo joins 'Unfiltered with Dan Bongino' to discuss Biden's weak response to Russian cyberattacks The following is an excerpt from ""Putin's Playbook: Russia's Secret Plan to Defeat America"" a book by Rebekah Koffler, a Russian-born U.S. intelligence expert. Working with the Defense Intelligence Agency, as well as the Central Intelligence Agency’s National Clandestine Service, she has led ""red"" teams during wargames and briefed the Pentagon, the White House, and on Russian affairs. Russia has the most sophisticated and destructive arsenal of cyber weapons of any foreign nation. In the hands of President Vladimir Putin, who ultimately controls this cyber arsenal as part of what is called the State System of Information Confrontation, these cyber weapons present a grave threat to America. Having been in the offensive cyber business for the past three decades, Russia has developed a set of potent tools that are superior in stealth, programming power, speed of attack and penetration of the adversary’s network, and creativity. The Russian president’s toolbox rivals that of American cyber warriors, and Russia’s highly innovative cyber doctrine has given Putin the ability to outplay the U.S. government and manipulate American citizens’ attitudes and perceptions of reality. Comparing Russia’s cyber hacking tradecraft with China’s, another very capable cyber adversary of the United States, former and director General Michael Hayden said, ""The Chinese have scale and the Russians have skill."" Former director of national intelligence James Clapper, referring to these countries’ cyber tactics, called the Chinese ""loud"" and the Russians ""stealthy."" : , , – 'S . 'S Russia has a hugely different conception of cyberwarfare than the United States, rooted in its culture of secrecy, its conspiratorial mindset, and the state’s drive to control its citizens’ behavior and thinking. Conversely, U.S. cyber doctrine reflects American culture and values, such as freedom of speech, privacy, and the government’s non-interference in individuals’ lives. Regrettably, I must say, in recent years I have observed considerable erosion of these foundational American principles and their replacement with politically correct speech, ""acceptable"" opinions, feelings-based conclusions, and behavior imposed by government on private businesses and religious organizations. It brings unwanted memories of my youth behind the Iron Curtain, where decades and even centuries of government censorship eventually led to individual citizens’ self-censorship of free expression, the most sophisticated form of state oppression. Based on their distinct cultures and values, Russia and the United States have approached the cyber issue from two different angles. The Americans, direct and straightforward in their thinking, have focused on the technical, ""cyber"" aspect—systems, networks, and data encoded in ones and zeros. The Russians, cunning in their thinking from having had to survive centuries of foreign invasions and domestic oppression, have focused on the ""informational-psychological"" aspect—actual information content, how information is perceived by human minds, and how it can influence and manipulate an adversary’s thinking. In May 2017, Clapper, commenting on Russia’s techniques employed during their 2016 covert influence campaign, told ’s Chuck Todd that the Russians are ""almost genetically driven to co-opt, penetrate, gain favor."" Although I am ethnically Russian, as a strong opponent of political correctness and self-censorship, I wasn’t offended by Clapper’s comments, because I didn’t interpret them literally as an intentional xenophobic attack on Russian ethnicity. I understood that his choice of words was intended simply as a colorful, albeit exaggerated, description of a cultural trait that is present in some Russians, just like their infamous propensity to consume large amounts of vodka. While U.S. cyber doctrine centers on cyber per se and Russia’s centers on information, both doctrines emphasize having an information advantage over the adversary. But when American war planners speak about this advantage, calling it ""information dominance,"" they mean having more information of intelligence value available to the warfighter, better access to information, better quality data, faster speed of delivery, preferably in real-time, and the like. Such ""information dominance"" would enable the warfighter to have better battlespace awareness and to achieve more precise targeting of the adversary, which would help win a conflict.",3,5.060834766929051,2.955821401568684,2.105013365360367,26
2021-07-25,Fox,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/china-russia-cyberattacks-biden-weak-response-newt-gingrich,"Newt Gingrich: China, Russia cyberattacks – Biden's weak response endangers US. Here's how","K.T. McFarland, former deputy national security advisor for President Trump, on China's government accommodating hackers. On Monday, the Biden administration formally blamed China for a massive cyberattack against Microsoft’s email software that impacted tens of thousands of U.S. businesses, government offices and schools. In response to this attack, the Biden administration opted for the ""name and shame"" approach by calling out China and publicizing an advisory list of more than 50 different tactics used by China’s hackers to target the United States. You can imagine how shaken Xi Jinping and the dictatorship were by being ""named and shamed."" They will accept that swap of action for words every day. During Monday’s press conference, President Biden revealed how weakly he is responding to the real threat of cyberwarfare – and how he fundamentally misunderstands what we are up against. : , – , Speaking at the press conference, Biden said, ""The Chinese government, not unlike the Russian government, is not doing this themselves, but are protecting those who are doing it and maybe even accommodating them being able to do it."" First, let’s be clear: citing senior officials, the Wall Street Journal reported on Monday that ""The U.S. government has high confidence that hackers tied to the Ministry of State Security, or , carried out the unusually indiscriminate hack of Microsoft Exchange Server software that emerged in March."" China’s Ministry of State Security is the equivalent of a combined and that is under the control of the Chinese Communist Party . There is no systematic activity happening in China that is against the wishes of Xi and the Chinese Communist Party. The Western idea of separation between public and private spheres simply does not exist. Second, Biden’s overt response to this attack is not proportionate to the severity of the breach. After the SolarWinds attack gave Russia’s Foreign Intelligence Service hackers access to as many as 18,000 Solarwind customers, including nearly a dozen U.S. government agencies, Biden responded with sanctions and the expulsion of Russian diplomats. But this more recent Microsoft hack was significantly more serious than the Solarwinds infiltration. Speaking to the Wall Street Journal, Dmitri Alperovitch, chairman of Silverado Policy Accelerator, said, ""The Microsoft Exchange hacks by contractors is the most reckless cyber operation we have yet seen from the Chinese actors – much more dangerous than the Russian SolarWindshacks."" Certainly, there could be covert operations underway that may never be made public, but the public response has ultimately created a double standard. Couple this double standard with Biden’s list of 16 sectors that are off limits to hacking and the result is a weak, confusing, public-facing cyber security policy. According to a February Gallup poll 82% of Americans see cyberterrorism as a critical threat. Cyberterrorism is seen as a critical threat by more Americans than any other issue surveyed, including the development of nuclear weapons in North Korea and Iran. As I write in my upcoming book, ""Beyond Biden"" , Americans’ concerns are well warranted considering the scope, scale and severity of cyberattacks against the United States in recent months – and the direct impact these attacks have had on Americans. U.S. must recognize that China’s and Russia’s approaches to warfare are fundamentally different than our own. In May, the Russian DarkSide ransomware attack took the Colonial Pipeline offline, which accounts for about 45% of the fuel supply on the East Coast. Also in May, the same Russian group that was responsible for the Solarwinds hack targeted 3,000 email accounts in 150 organizations as part of a ""continuation of multiple efforts … to target government agencies involved in foreign policy as part of intelligence gathering efforts,"" according to Microsoft. In June, Russian hackers also forced the shutdown of nine beef plants in the U.S. and the same group then launched another attack against Kaseya in July, infecting nearly 1,500 organizations around the world. Importantly, experts noted that in the Kaseya attack, ""The gang used a level of planning and sophistication closer to high-level, government-backed hackers, rather than a mere criminal operation."" President Biden can stand at the podium and attempt to make subtle distinctions between rogue cyber gangs and government-sponsored cyberattacks. But we must ask ourselves the question: In two countries that are ruled by dictators – whose power is ultimately secured through surveillance, control and suppression of dissent – how likely is it that such sophisticated cyber criminals act independent of the regimes? Also, in order to effectively address the ongoing cyber threat, the U.S. must recognize that China’s and Russia’s approaches to warfare are fundamentally different than our own. For example, the 1999 ""Unrestricted Warfare"" publication by two Chinese military colonels concludes that there are ""virtually infinite"" new battlefields in modern warfare that erase the lines between soldiers and civilians. Similarly, according to a U.S. Army assessment, we have not identified an effective counter-strategy to Russia’s gray zone warfighting doctrine , which operates between the zones of war and peace. As the world becomes more digitally interconnected, and as high-value infrastructure targets reside within the private sector, the cyberwarfare threat to America is dangerous, especially within the context of the changing geopolitical landscape. This summer, Beijing and Moscow reaffirmed their commitment to strengthening their strategic partnership by extending their 20-year-old friendship treaty. Russia also agreed to sign on to China’s data security initiative, an effort that was launched in response to the Trump administration’s moves to restrict Chinese technologies that pose national security risks. Further, Russia and China agreed to cooperate on information security and to ""continue to promote the construction of a global system."" The goals of General Secretary Xi and President Vladimir Putin to weaken and supersede the United States are clearly aligned. Biden’s inability to respond firmly to these cyber acts of war only empower the Chinese and Russian dictatorships. It’s time we get serious about fighting this invisible war.

Former Station Chief Dan Hoffman with insight on 'Fox & Friends First.' A senior official who spearheaded the agency’s search for Usama bin Laden has been tapped to lead a task force investigating the cause of the mysterious ""Havana Syndrome,"" which has inflicted cognitive difficulties and even brain damage on scores of U.S. spies and diplomats abroad. Director William J. Burns selected the undercover official whose experience includes spending over a decade at the agency’s Counterterrorism Center working intelligence analysis and targeting focused on bin Laden and his Al Qaeda network, the Wall Street Journal first reported. The individual will now lead a task force first formed in December after a panel of scientists from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine identified ""directed, pulsed radio frequency energy"" as the most likely cause of the ""Havana Syndrome"" – which received that name because symptoms were first reported by diplomats at the U.S. embassy in Cuba’s capital city in 2016. By May, at least 130 unexplained cases of dizziness, headache, fatigue, nausea, anxiety, cognitive difficulties, memory loss and even brain damage were under investigation, up from several dozen last year. Still, no definitive cause has been determined. Just last week, the State Department announced additional cases being investigated at the U.S. embassy in Vienna, Austria. ‘’ : ‘ ’T , ' Vienna has for centuries been a center for espionage and diplomacy and was a hub for clandestine spy-versus-spy activity during the Cold War. It's currently the site of indirect talks between Iran and the U.S. over salvaging the nuclear deal negotiated there in 2015, the Associated Press reported. The task force, comprised of intelligence analysts, clandestine officers who collect human intelligence, clinicians and human resource specialists, will also seek to determine whether any specific individual or group is behind the attacks, The Washington Post also reported. Several former and current officials told the publication they suspect the Russian government, though Moscow has denied any involvement and intelligence hasn’t been able to definitively confirm their responsibility. Burns, who became director in March, has made getting officers afflicted by the Havana Syndrome a top priority and has visited several suffering from more severe cases being treated at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Maryland. News about the task force’s new leadership comes amid historic protests seen in Havana and other Cuban cities, as the subsequent crackdown by the country’s dictatorship has prompted several U.S. politicians of Cuban descent to call on the Biden administration to intervene to protect human rights.

U.S. President Joe Biden and his coterie of ""experts""––who just finished a summit in Geneva where they sought to ""stabilize"" relations with Russia and asked Putin to limit his cyberattacking habit––are merely projecting weakness to a Russian president who is not seeking stability and views cyberattacks as an invaluable tool. '' Late Friday evening, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency sent out an advisory that it was ""taking action to understand and address"" another on-going ransomware cyberattack. Cybersecurity experts involved in the investigation characterized the attack as ""colossal."" The hack since has been attributed to the same ""Russia-linked"" criminals who struck our meat supply a month earlier, extorting 11 million dollars from the supplier. This time the target list is thousands of companies. The Russians achieved a ""force multiplier effect"" by striking what’s called a supply chain vendor, Kaseya , and multiple managed services that employ software. Thousands of targets were affected, many of which were small and medium-size businesses. Biden’s silly gesture to hand to Putin a list of 16 ""do not attack"" critical infrastructure targets during the summit in June failed to discourage Russia from continuing its cyber offensive. What’s more, it validated what the Russian planners knew all along by studying our responses for two decades. Putin is convinced that Russia’s ""low-grade"" cyber warfare aimed at destabilizing America will not provoke Washington to respond militarily. Russia’s asymmetric doctrine envisions fighting the fight below the threshold of a kinetic confrontation. By allowing another devastating cyberattack on the U.S., just some weeks after President Biden begged Putin to halt cyber strikes on America, Putin demonstrated his lack of respect for Biden. The Kremlin viewed the summit as theater, a propaganda opportunity for Russia that permitted Putin a chance to humiliate Washington while portraying Russia as a superpower ""equal"" to America. ’T ’S ’T A : ‘I ' After the summit, Putin’s ""analysts"" mocked Biden’s team in the Russian press by writing that the ""Americans are more afraid of a cyber war than a nuclear war."" They characterized U.S.-Russia relations as those of ""strategic instability,"" rebuffing the Biden Administration’s ""strategic stability"" agenda for the summit. Russian specialists in U.S.-Russian relations forecast ""no change"" between Washington and Moscow’s posture. Along with sheer disrespect, there’s something even more disturbing that probably drives Putin’s decision calculus to ratchet up his cyber offensive: Moscow views Biden as weak and unlikely to fight back. For months before the summit, the Russian media, most of which is state-controlled, was speculating about the deterioration of Biden’s mental health. They cited the perceived troubles by the U.S. president to ""annunciate words,"" the ""struggles to deliver even short speeches,"" once confusing former president Trump with Putin, and mispronouncing the Russian president’s name as ""Klutin."" There is nothing on a Russian ""news"" site that the Kremlin would not want there. The Russians place a premium on mental acuity for presidents. This is because Moscow, which possesses the world’s largest nuclear arsenal and a complex nuclear employment, is prepared to fight a limited nuclear war if faced in an armed conflict with a conventionally superior power, such as the United States. Unlike his bushy eye-browed Soviet counterpart Leonid Brezhnev, who trembled when faced with a task of pressing the ""button"" in a nuclear training exercise, Putin routinely presides over nuclear drills conducted by the Russian armed forces. Putin, who thoroughly cultivates his image of mental and physical toughness, probably sees the U.S. president as inferior. Biden’s soft and incoherent policy towards Russia likely validates Putin’s conclusion. Despite its harsh rhetoric towards Putin and Russia, the Biden administration canceled economic sanctions on Nordstream 2 and continues to attribute the devastating cyberattacks on American businesses, including our food and gas supplies, to Russia–based hackers, rather than calling out Putin as ultimately responsible. Use of criminal groups to achieve the state’s objectives is a standard operating procedure when it comes to Russia’s approach to cyber warfare. Biden is not getting any younger, but he can wage a tougher policy against Putin. He has said that if he can attribute the latest cyberattack to Russia, he will respond forcefully. He should. But sadly, we may never see it.",3,3.2524868934061892,2.413095183783053,0.8393917096231363,7

An advisory released by the U.S. National Security Agency describes attacks by operatives linked to the , the Russian military intelligence agency, which has been previously tied to major cyberattacks abroad and efforts to disrupt the 2016 and 2020 American elections. In a statement, Cybersecurity Director Rob Joyce said the campaign was ""likely ongoing, on a global scale."" : ‘’ Brute force attacks involve the automated spraying of sites with potential passwords until hackers gain access. The advisory urges companies to adopt methods long urged by experts as common-sense cyber hygiene, including the use of multi-factor authentication and mandating strong passwords. Issued during a devastating wave of ransomware attacks on governments and key infrastructure, the advisory does not disclose specific targets of the campaign or its presumed purpose, saying only that hackers have targeted hundreds of organizations worldwide. The says -linked operatives have tried to break into networks using Kubernetes, an open-source tool originally developed by Google to manage cloud services, since at least mid-2019 through early this year. While a ""significant amount"" of the attempted break-ins targeted organizations using Microsoft's Office 365 cloud services, the hackers went after other cloud providers and email servers as well, the said. The U.S. has long accused Russia of using and tolerating cyberattacks for espionage, spreading disinformation, and the disruption of governments and key infrastructure. The Russian Embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday. Joe Slowik, a threat analyst at the network-monitoring firm Gigamon, said the activity described by on Thursday shows the has further streamlined an already popular technique for breaking into networks. He said it appears to overlap with Department of Energy reporting on brute force intrusion attempts in late 2019 and early 2020 targeting the U.S. energy and government sectors and is something the U.S. government has apparently been aware of for some time. , , , Slowik said the use of Kubernetes ""is certainly a bit unique, although on its own it doesn’t appear worrying."" He said the brute force method and lateral movement inside networks described by are common among state-backed hackers and criminal ransomware gangs, allowing the to blend in with other actors. John Hultquist, vice president of analysis at the cybersecurity firm Mandiant, characterized the activity described in the advisory as ""routine collection against policy makers, diplomats, the military, and the defense industry.""

But that doesn't mean they wouldn't intervene in the next election. We can expect they’ll use certain tactics, like social media, to help favored candidates. But I do think they’ll be a little more risk-averse when it comes to overt things, like hacking institutions,"" Schiff said. ""They have to know that would prompt a very serious response from this president, unlike what we have had over the last four years."" ""This is happening, and it has been happening for years and years,"" he said. ""And what we've been doing thus far hasn't worked. One of the hospitals in my district was ransomware attacked years and years ago, and it was a paltry amount in Bitcoin they were required to pay, but since then the amounts have gone up, the sophistication of these groups have increased, and unless we get more serious both about our defense, which has to be number one, but also our offense, we're going to see more of this."" President Biden met with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday. Biden told reporters he gave Putin a list of 16 critical infrastructure entities that are ""off limits"" to a Russian cyberattack. Biden's list effectively gave the Russians a green light to target everything not on that list without facing serious repercussions, national security experts and senior Republicans told Fox News. President Joe Biden meets with Russian President Vladimir Putin, Wednesday, June 16, 2021, at the 'Villa la Grange', in Geneva, Switzerland. ""I talked about the proposition that certain critical infrastructure should be off limits to attack — period — by cyber or any other means. I gave them a list, if I’m not mistaken — I don't have it in front of me — 16 specific entities; 16 defined as critical infrastructure under U.S. policy, from the energy sector to our water systems,"" Biden said. Schiff said Sunday that Putin has no plausible deniability regarding cybercriminals harbored in Russia. ""It is not credible for him to suggest even if he knew they were operating on his soil that he was powerless to do something about it. These criminal actors don't go after the Russian oligarchs, they don’t go after the Russian state or Russian industry because they know they would end up in a gulag somewhere,"" Schiff said. Russian cybercriminals are believed to be behind a pair of recent cyberattacks targeting the Colonial Pipeline and meat-processing company Holdings. Both companies paid multi-million dollar ransoms to regain access to their systems.",3,2.665011263532656,2.4921131233975142,0.1728981401351417,7

2021-06-15,Fox,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/putin-russia-cyberattacks-defense-intelligence-agency-officer,"Ex-Defense Intelligence Agency Officer: Putin, Russia cyberattacks – get ready, there are many more on the way","Fox News senior foreign affairs correspondent Greg Palkot reports from Windsor. Americans are already contending with the consequences of two major Russian cyberattacks, including gas shortages and price hikes due the Colonial Pipeline hack and potentially rising prices on steak and burgers after the meat processing company was hit. But get ready, because more is on the way. Moscow will likely further escalate its aggression against U.S. interests. U.S. officials, in charge of keeping America safe have not taken the Russian threat seriously enough. Because Russian President Putin’s goal is much bigger than the infliction of a few inconveniences. It is, rather, the unraveling of our society and the weakening of our nation, which Russia views as the primary threat against it. The Kremlin recently declared — with typical intentional ambiguity — its intent to use ""forceful measures,"" including ""coercive use of force,"" ""when necessary,"" against ""unfriendly"" countries. But this almost certainly refers to the United States. The warning came on May 31st from the Head of Russia’s Security Council, Nikolai Patrushev, who in his interview with Russia’s Gazette announced the decision to update Russia’s National Security Strategy. This doctrinal text codifies threats to Russia’s security, as the Kremlin sees them, and provides guidance to the defense establishment on how to counter these threats. Putin will probably approve the new strategy before his June 16 meeting with President Biden, though he may wait to see the outcome of the meeting. '' Patrushev warned that, based on the new strategy, Moscow is justified in using ""symmetric and asymmetric"" measures against ""unfriendly"" countries, in order to deter security threats. Russia has declared its view of the U.S. and as a primary danger to its security in several strategic planning documents, including its military doctrine. President Putin frequently alludes to Russia’s intent to employ an ""asymmetric strategy"" against its adversaries, which would include cyberattacks against the U.S. Putin’s Press Secretary Dmitry Peskov echoed his boss’s sentiment, warning Washington to ""expect uncomfortable signals."" Alarmingly, the Russians have made good on those warnings. Russia believes it is justified in harming the U.S. economy through cyberattacks. The Kremlin thinks the United States, through economic sanctions, set out to undermine the Russian economy and its defense, as well as to turn Russians against Putin’s regime. Moscow’s fears of regime collapse stem from the demise of Russia’s predecessor the and the economic shocks that followed it in the 1990s. ’T ’S ’T A : ‘I ' The United States, although boasting the strongest military in the world, has few responses to the powerful and sophisticated suite of offensive tools Russia terms ""asymmetric."" This arsenal includes disinformation, interference in elections, and of course, cyber strikes, to name a few. Moscow has used cyber to spy and wreak havoc on America’s government, corporate, and military networks. Putin’s strategists view cyber as a powerful weapon, on par with a nuclear strike. A cyber strike, in their view, can produce a similar devastating effect on the adversary’s economy and people’s psychology, causing chaos but without a ""mushroom cloud."" U.S. cyber warriors, on the other hand, have been appropriately hesitant about unleashing America’s mighty cyber fury on Russia, reserving our special toolkit for wartime. Russia has been honing its cyber tools, while gauging America’s responses since the late 1990s. It first launched a multiyear cyber espionage operation, dubbed by investigators Moonlight Maze, against systems in the Pentagon, , weapons labs, and other organizations throughout the United States. Since then, Moscow has penetrated many federal agencies, including the Defense Department, the State Department and the White House. Recent cyberattacks indicate that critical infrastructure, including our gasoline and food supply, remains vulnerable to cyber intrusions more than two decades later. Even our weapon systems have mission-critical cyber vulnerabilities, according to the 2018 Report by the Government Accountability Office. Russia believes Americans are overdependent on digital technology for their daily lives and have low tolerance for the discomfort that cyber disruptions can bring. By attacking critical facilities, like a pipeline or meat processing facility, Moscow believes it can undermine Americans’ support for and confidence in their president. By interfering in our elections, Moscow seeks to foment discord and amplify existing societal tensions. And it doesn’t particularly care which party is in charge, seeking to discredit any U.S. president, whether Republican or Democrat. Moscow wants to keep the confrontation below the threshold of outright war and views cyber as a unique weapon that could help it achieve this goal. Russian intelligence tradecraft includes the use of cyber-criminals and so-called hacktivists to achieve the regime’s goals, in order to maintain plausible deniability. These criminals sometimes work under their handlers’ supervision. This makes attribution of cyberattacks complicated, but the line of responsibility ultimately runs to the Kremlin. Russian planners also developed a nuanced cyber doctrine benignly called ""information confrontation."" It envisions an indefinite non-kinetic conflict — neither peace, nor war — a type of low-intensity warfare that U.S. strategists have termed a ""gray zone conflict."" Many experts worry however, that Russia’s reckless behavior in the cyber domain could escalate into war, even if unintentionally. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark Milley recently warned that competition with Russia could lead to great power conflict. Moscow’s view of cyber as a tool that can destabilize societies is clearly articulated in Russian language military journals, doctrinal writings, leaders’ speeches, and policy documents. The recent cyber sabotage, waged by what President Joe Biden meekly called Russia-based hackers, speaks loudly and clearly. Our national security officials have not been listening. If they want to prevent Russia from achieving its goal of upending civil order in the United States, they’d better start tuning in.",3,2.582902236173736,3.1133578742635946,-0.5304556380898586,7

In his first month in the role, he is pushing what he says is one of the most ambitious and aggressive science budgets in agency history, making strides in exploration with missions both in space and on Earth. The White House's spending proposal to Congress included a request of more than $24.8 billion for in the 2022 fiscal year, with a 9% funding increase to its science division. In an interview with Fox News on Thursday, Nelson said that the introduction of ""highly sophisticated instruments"" like the three-dimensional climate modeling Earth Observatory System would ""go beyond just weather"" for the betterment of the planet. , , 'S In addition, the former Democratic U.S. senator from Florida touted advancements in commercial spaceflight, noting that the way operates has ""already changed"" because of companies like Elon Musk's SpaceX and Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin. ""What we found is the commercial activity and low Earth orbit has been substantial and it has been very successful,"" he said. ""The delivery of cargo and crew where gives a fixed price contract – no cost overruns – to a commercial company to deliver, in this case, cargo and/or crew to the International Space Station, has been extremely successful and safe, I might add."" Now, the 78-year-old says, the question is regarding what the role is for commercial companies other than the relationship the organizations have ""always had"" with : development, tech and research under a spearheaded program. Nelson pointed out that the highly-anticipated Artemis Program's human lunar lander demonstration marked an important step in the evolution of the relationship between and commercial companies like SpaceX. In this photo provided by , Administrator Bill Nelson speaks during his first major address to employees, at the agency's headquarters in the Mary W. Jackson Building in Washington on Wednesday, June 2, 2021. He spoke about the plans for future Earth-focused missions to address climate change and a robotic and human return to the Moon through the Artemis program, as well as announcing two new planetary science missions to Venus – and +. In April, SpaceX was awarded the coveted $2.89 billion contract for the development of the first commercial human lander that will land the first woman and first person of color on the moon in 2024. However, later suspended the contract after commercial rivals Blue Origin and Dynetics – which were also in the running – filed protests over the award. The Government Accountability Office has opened an investigation into the issue that is slated to conclude by Aug. 4. That said, the administrator noted that people have ""been energized by what they see,"" spotlighting SpaceX launches to low Earth orbit. ""People have really been amazed at what the commercial sector has done and make it cheaper for . Because, these are contracts that are negotiated and they are a fixed price,"" he said. While progress has been made in the commercial sector by partnering with , billionaire leaders like Musk and Bezos have their own ideas as well. Recently, Musk has told reporters about his goal to make the human race a ""multi-planetary species."" 'S , When asked if there was weight to Musk's idea, Nelson did not mention the Tesla co-founder by name. Instead, he made reference to the agency's upcoming telescope project: thought to be a successor to the beloved Hubble Space Telescope. ""At the end of October, we're going to put up the next space telescope called James Webb. And, it is going to peer back in time – now, you won't believe the number, but this is true – 13.35 billion years. And, it's going to capture the light shortly after the Big Bang. And, in cosmic terms, that's about 150 million years after the Big Bang,"" he said. ""In other words, it's hard for me to think that this cosmos is that big. There are so many worlds and suns and solar systems and galaxies that we have never discovered. Is there a circumstance elsewhere in a cosmos that big that there's another sun and another Earth revolving around that sun?"" asked the administrator. ""The possibilities are limitless."" ""And so, as we continue to expand out, not only with our telescopes, not only listening for any sign of intelligent message, not only with human exploration further out added to our robotic exploration, this is fulfilling our destiny as an American people. Our character, in our , is that we are always pressing a frontier,"" said Nelson. ""And, that's what makes it so exciting to be at this agency and I suspect that's why this agency is considered the most popular federal government agency or department that there is."" With the promise of fantastic and wonderful mysteries on the metaphorical horizon, the future of exploration lies at and in Nelson's hands. But, it's also very much a team effort. In many ways, the International Space Station has served as a reminder of that endeavor. However, Earthbound political posturing has recently impacted the zero-gravity ""Switzerland.""

""We have over 18 countries that are participating with us on the International Space Station. Russia built the station with us. I want Russia to continue what has been an incredible cooperation in space between two countries that, on the ground, are often butting heads,"" he said, adding that he hopes space will ""continue to be the venue"" for international cooperation with ""someone who otherwise is one of our competitors and whose government does not necessarily get along with our government.""

Bob Casey, D-Pa., on keeping U.S. infrastructure safe. Senate Sergeant at Arms Karen Gibson said Saturday that she finds the threat of a cyberattack on the U.S. Capitol more worrisome than another repeat of the Jan. 6 assault. ""I worry a lot more about cybersecurity than I do about another mob attacking the Capitol,"" the Senate's chief law enforcement officer for the Senate told . - 16 : Gibson said attempted intrusions on the Capitol networks occur on a daily basis, and with the recent rise in ransomware attacks, cybersecurity has become a greater risk.

""Members have sensitive information that they would not necessarily want to have disclosed that may be in documents. Much of what we do is public.

It remains unclear if paid a ransom, but the attack on the largest U.S. fuel pipeline cost Colonial nearly $4.5 million dollars so the company could regain access to its system. President Biden called for a federal overhaul of the government’s approach to cybersecurity in a May executive order, following the Russia-led Solar Winds attack. The Justice Department also announced earlier this week it is elevating the priority it places on ransomware attacks. The Biden administration has urged the private sector to more heavily invest in countering cybersecurity. ""I've often thought of that as sort of the soft underbelly of America -- the critical infrastructure that's in private sector hands, and may or may not be secured to the extent that we need it to be, as we saw, perhaps, with the Colonial Pipeline ransomware incident. There are many opportunities for those who wish us harm to do so, in a cyber domain,"" Gibson said. ""It's certainly going to keep the cybersecurity staff very busy for the foreseeable future.""

Richard Hudson, R-N.C., argues that President Biden 'needs to' tell Russian President Vladimir Putin to 'stop the hacking, then we will sit down and talk.' The Department of Justice is looking to elevate investigations surrounding ransomware attacks to be on par with how terrorism is prioritized, reports noted Thursday. The recent increase in cyberattacks targeting U.S. interests, including the fallout from the East Coast’s Colonial pipeline hack, have prompted officials to take decisive action, Reuters first reported. A spokesperson told Fox News the department has made it a ""key priority"" to target the ""expediential growth of ransomware."" ""A central goal of the recently launched Ransomware and Digital Extortion Task Force is to ensure we bring to bear the full authorities and resources of the Department in confronting the many dimensions and root causes of this threat,"" Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco wrote in a memo obtained by Fox News Thursday. The cyberattack last month against the largest U.S. fuel pipeline lasted for seven days, causing a spike in gas prices and temporary fuel shortages. Ultimately, Colonial chose to payout $5 million in ransom funds a criminal group based in Russia in order to regain access to their system. Internal guidance sent to U.S. attorney's offices nationwide pointed to the Colonial attack as an example of the ""growing threat that ransomware and digital extortion pose to the nation.""

The latest ransomware assault this week shut down the U.S.-based meat plants of the world’s largest meatpacker, Brazil-based , and the White House said a criminal group likely based in Russia is thought to be responsible for the ransomware attack. ""All of this is Vladimir Putin’s resurgence strategy,"" said former Moscow station chief Daniel Hoffman, a Fox News contributor. ' ' 'T ' ' Hoffman, who served in Moscow for five years, said these attacks are occurring as a show of force in the lead-up to the June 16 summit. ""He has to tear down our democracy because it’s a threat to them,"" he added. The attack on – a major meat supplier to the U.S. – comes just weeks after the largest U.S. fuel pipeline, the East Coast's Colonial pipeline, was targeted by a criminal group originating in Russia. In April, Putin massed tens of thousands of troops on the Ukraine border. The Biden administration declined to condemn Putin, Russia's president, after the Colonial pipeline attack and stressed that the U.S. does not believe Russia's government was involved. ""We do not believe — I emphasize, we do not believe the Russian government was involved in this attack. But we do have strong reason to believe that criminals who did the attack are living in Russia,"" President Biden said on May 13. Rebekah Koffler, a former Defense Intelligence Agency intelligence officer for Russia and author of the upcoming ""Putin's Playbook: Russia's Secret Plan to Defeat America,"" told Fox News the use of criminal gangs is a common tactic by the Kremlin. ""They do that to maintain plausible deniability,"" Koffler said, pointing to Russia’s use of mercenaries in Ukraine and Syria. ""What Putin wants is to establish what we call the 'balance of power,'"" she said. The U.S. and Russia have long competed on a global scale, and where the U.S. exceeds Russian capabilities, as in the case with the U.S. military, Putin has relied on other factors to bolster Russian dominance – including cyber-strikes. ’T ""Putin is trying to signal to President Biden that he is in a much stronger position ahead of the summit,"" Koffler said. The former intelligence officer argued that while Biden’s rhetoric condemning Putin has been strong, his actions have been weak. Late last month, the president lifted Trump-era sanctions targeting the controversial Nord Stream 2 pipeline that will run natural gas from Russia to Europe – a move some believe sends the wrong message to European allies. Apart from geopolitical jockeying, experts believe one of the biggest hurdles facing the U.S in the upcoming summit is Putin’s disinterest in improving relations. ""That’s not what Vladimir Putin seems to want,"" Hoffman said. Putin’s determination to overcome the U.S. in the global superpower arena means they will never be interested in pursuing a ""friendship,"" argued Koffler. ""The U.S. security apparatus has falsely been imagining that certain things are achievable with Russia, and every single president has tried the so-called ‘reset’ and failed,"" she said. ""Because Russia does not view itself as a friend."" The Kremlin issued a warning earlier this week that ""uncomfortable"" signals would be sent to the U.S. ahead of the summit later this month. ""The Americans must assume that a number of signals from Moscow ... will be uncomfortable for them, including in the coming days,"" Sergei Ryabkov, Russia's deputy foreign minister, told news agency, reported Reuters Monday. The comments were made after Biden said he would press Putin on issues surrounding human rights. Ties between Biden and Putin have been strained following a March interview with ’s George Stephanopoulos when the U.S. president was asked if he thought Putin was a ""killer,"" to which he answered, ""I do."" Putin later replied, ""Takes one to know one."" Koffler argued Biden’s comments during the interview may have emboldened the Russian adversary, though whether Biden’s words will have an effect on the summit remains to be seen. Hoffman, on the other hand, does not believe the dialogue of a domestic interview will hinder U.S.-Russia relations. ""It doesn’t matter,"" the former Moscow-based station chief told Fox News. ""The Russians have been very active against us forever."" ""Calling Putin a killer is just theatrics,"" Hoffman added.

""We have always encouraged companies not to pay ransom, because it encourages future attacks."" Kitchen pointed to the monumental consequences private companies face when targeted by ransomware, including significant financial loss and potentially devastating shortages for consumers. - But according to Kitchen, there are two major problems that arise once a ransom is paid. There is no guarantee a ransomer will unlock what they are holding hostage once payment is submitted, and the payment sets a precedent that could encourage other groups to engage in ransomware. ""U.S. policy needs to more directly engage with ransomware,"" the technology and national security-focused fellow urged. ""We need to change the political calculus of foreign governments who allow ransomware attackers to operate with impunity within their borders."" The White House has attributed the attacks on and the East Coast’s Colonial pipeline – which struck the largest U.S. fuel pipeline last month – to criminal organizations within Russia. Biden is expected to address the attacks with Russian President Vladimir Putin in the June 16 summit in Geneva, White House officials announced Wednesday. But the president has so far not said the Kremlin has had any affiliation with the ransomware attacks. ""It’s time for the United States to start putting heads on spikes when it comes to confronting and dismantling ransomware groups,"" Kitchen said. ""If President Biden does not confront Vladimir Putin about the ransomware groups perpetrating from within Russia, he will be failing in his duty to protect the United States from these types of attacks,"" he added.

Malliotakis: Biden's human rights choice – turn blind eye to UN corruption or demand reform?,"Former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley has this advice for President Biden regarding potentially rejoining the U.N. Human Rights Council: 'Don't do it.' President Joe Biden has made his intentions to return to the failed foreign policies of the past very clear. This includes the Biden administration’s intent for the United States to ""re-engage immediately and robustly"" with the United Nations Human Rights Council without receiving any commitments for much needed institutional reforms. The U.N. General Assembly created the in 2006 to strengthen the promotion and protection of human rights globally and address the most pressing human rights crises. Since then, the very essence of the has been corrupt, with some of the world’s worst human rights violators as sitting members, including China, Russia, Venezuela and Cuba. Both of our families know firsthand the human cost associated with repressive regimes. Our families had their beloved homeland taken over by brutal communists, and their experiences shaped our lives and gave us a special appreciation for the freedoms and values we have as Americans. It also gave us the understanding that America has to stand in support of human rights across the globe. : – 'S - More than 60 years later, the basic rights of the Cuban people remain nonexistent. Shamefully, Cuba is a current member of the , where they are given a platform to speak on human rights. This is an absolute slap in the face to the Cuban people. Similarly disturbing is Venezuela’s current membership on the council. Venezuelan dictator Nicolás Maduro made an address at the opening of the council’s 46th regular session this year. This is an insult to the millions of Venezuelans who are suffering, including the approximately five million refugees and migrants who have been forced to flee due to the humanitarian catastrophe brought on by Maduro’s corrupt narco-regime. In a matter of years, Maduro transformed Venezuela from one of the wealthiest countries in South America into an economic catastrophe, where Venezuelans cannot access basic essentials. The illegitimate regime has killed and tortured dissidents, independent reporters, university students and civilians. This is the same regime that was found to have committed crimes against humanity by the U.N. Independent Fact-Finding Mission on Venezuela. Current members on the council also include Russia, where Vladimir Putin and his cronies target dissidents, invade neighboring countries, and are working to stamp out independent media from the country. And the most egregious of all might be a sitting member that is actively committing genocide. One of ’s longest-serving members, China, under the control of the Chinese Communist Party , is currently waging a brutal campaign of crimes against humanity and genocide against Uyghur Muslims. Their crimes include forced abortions and sterilization, forced labor, and detaining over one million Uyghurs and other Muslims in camps. The Council has also made no effort to mask its contempt for the Jewish state of Israel. The obsession and hostility toward Israel has led to a permanent agenda item – number 7 – focused on condemning Israel. No other country is subject to such perpetual harassment. Israel is the sole democracy in the Middle East that respects human rights and the rule of law. Yet, over half of resolutions target Israel. Oppressed peoples around the world are watching in the hopes that America will stand with them and against their oppressors. The Human Rights Council is a broken institution. Any country that egregiously violates the basic rights of its citizens should not have a role on an international body tasked with ending human rights abuses. It is a mockery to human rights everywhere and the United States should not participate unless real reforms are met. America’s presence on the council, alongside these nations, only legitimizes the hypocritical abuses that have plagued this body for years. For the sake of those suffering under repressive regimes, President Biden must make the right choice and stand for human rights. The Biden administration should not follow in the footsteps of the Obama administration and so-called experts who prioritized meaningless ""engagement"" over impact. Biden proudly proclaimed ""America is back,"" but America should not go ""back"" to international organizations that undermine our interests and human rights globally. The bottom line is this: returning to the would require a dramatic overhaul of this corrupt body to implement its founding mission. Oppressed peoples around the world are watching in the hopes that America will stand with them and against their oppressors. Do what is right, Mr. President. . .",13,3.193121547973444,3.712258404228913,-0.5191368562554688,1

It’s already a complicated issue and about to get more so as the wealthy snap up spacecraft seats and even entire flights for themselves and their entourages. Astronauts? Amateur astronauts? Space tourists? Space sightseers? Rocket riders? Or as the Russians have said for decades, spaceflight participants? , ’s new boss Bill Nelson doesn’t consider himself an astronaut even though he spent six days orbiting Earth in 1986 aboard space shuttle Columbia — as a congressman. ""I reserve that term for my professional colleagues,"" Nelson recently told The Associated Press. Computer game developer Richard Garriott — who paid his way to the International Space Station in 2008 with the Russians — hates the space tourist label. ""I am an astronaut,"" he declared in an email, explaining that he trained for two years for the mission. - In this Monday, March 29, 2021 photo provided by SpaceX, from left, Jared Isaacman, Hayley Arceneaux, Sian Proctor and Chris Sembroski pose for a photo on the SpaceX launch tower at 's Kennedy Space Center at Cape Canaveral, Fla. SpaceX’s high tech capsules are completely automated, as are Blue Origin’s. So should wealthy riders and their guests be called astronauts even if they learn the ropes in case they need to intervene in an emergency? ""If you go to space, you’re an astronaut,"" said Axiom Space’s Michael Lopez-Alegria, a former astronaut who will accompany three businessmen to the space station in January, flying SpaceX. His $55 million-a-seat clients plan to conduct research up there, he stressed, and do not consider themselves space tourists. There’s something enchanting about the word: Astronaut comes from the Greek words for star and sailor. And swashbuckling images of ""The Right Stuff"" and 's original Mercury 7 astronauts make for great marketing. Jeff Bezos’ rocket company, Blue Origin, is already calling its future clients ""astronauts."" It’s auctioning off one seat on its first spaceflight with people on board, targeted for July. even has a new acronym: for Private Astronaut Mission. - Retired astronaut Mike Mullane didn’t consider himself an astronaut until his first space shuttle flight in 1984, six years after his selection by . ""It doesn’t matter if you buy a ride or you’re assigned to a ride,"" said Mullane, whose 2006 autobiography is titled ""Riding Rockets."" Until you strap into a rocket and reach a certain altitude, ""you’re not an astronaut."" It remains a coveted assignment. More than 12,000 applied for ’s upcoming class of astronauts; a lucky dozen or so will be selected in December. But what about passengers who are along for the ride, like the Russian actress and movie director who will fly to the space station in October? Or Japan’s moonstruck billionaire who will follow them from Kazakhstan in December with his production assistant tagging along to document everything? In each case, a professional cosmonaut will be in charge of the Soyuz capsule. - This undated illustration provided by Blue Origin shows the capsule that the company aims to take tourists into space. Jeff Bezos' rocket company is already calling its future clients ""astronauts."" One seat is up for grabs on the New Shepard rocket's debut passenger flight scheduled for July 2021; an online auction is underway. SpaceX’s high tech capsules are completely automated, as are Blue Origin’s. So should rich riders and their guests be called astronauts even if they learn the ropes in case they need to intervene in an emergency? Perhaps even more important, where does space begin? The Federal Aviation Administration limits its commercial astronaut wings to flight crews. The minimum altitude is 50 miles . It’s awarded seven so far; recipients include the two pilots for Richard Branson's Virgin Galactic who made another test flight of the company's rocket ship Saturday. 2--1: Others define space as beginning at an even 100 kilometers, or 62 miles above sea level. Blue Origin’s capsules are designed to reach that threshold and provide a few minutes of weightlessness before returning to Earth, By contrast, it takes 1 1/2 hours to circle the world. The Association of Space Explorers requires at least one orbit of Earth — in a spacecraft — for membership. The Astronauts Memorial Foundation honors all those who sacrificed their lives for the U.S. space program even if they never reached space, like Challenger schoolteacher Christa McAuliffe and the test pilot killed in a 2014 Virgin Galactic crash. Also on the Space Mirror Memorial at ’s Kennedy Space Center: X-15 and F-104 Air Force pilots who were part of a military space program that never got off the ground. The astronaut debate has been around since the 1960s, according to Garriott. His late father, Owen Garriott, was among the first so-called scientist-astronauts hired by ; the test pilots in the office resented sharing the job title. It might be necessary to retire the term altogether once hundreds if not thousands reach space, noted Fordham University history professor Asif Siddiqi, the author of several space books. ""Are we going to call each and every one of them astronauts?"" Mullane, the three-time space shuttle flier, suggests using astronaut first class, second class, third class, ""depending on what your involvement is, whether you pull out a wallet and write a check."" While a military-style pecking order might work, former historian Roger Launius warned: ""This gets really complicated really quickly.""",3,4.475567420880777,4.03500962360771,0.4405577972730672,6

Administrator Bill Nelson addressed concerns regarding recent competition from China's space program. Speaking virtually on Wednesday with lawmakers at his first congressional hearing as the agency's 14th administrator, he discussed future China National Space Administration endeavors. Space.com reported that Nelson spotlighted the agency's plans to send three ""big"" landers to the moon – whereas, comparatively, is slated to launch just one ice-hunting rover there in 2023. The former Democratic Florida senator who flew on a space shuttle in 1986 reportedly also highlighted reports that would send astronauts on a trip near the moon and land there within the decade. ""In other words, they're going to be landing humans on the moon. That should tell us something about our need to get off our duff and get our human landing system going vigorously,"" he said. In addition, the newly appointed head showed attendees a photo of the East Asian power player's Zhurong Mars rover, which successfully landed on the red planet last week as part of the country's Tianwen-1 mission. In this photo taken by China's Zhurong Mars rover and made available by the China National Space Administration on Wednesday, May 19, 2021, the rover's solar panels and antenna are deployed as the rover sits on its lander on the surface of Mars. In a statement released hours after released the first images taken by the rover, Nelson congratulated the country – now the second nation to land on Mars. ""Congratulations to the China National Space Administration on receiving the first images from the Zhurong Mars rover!"" he said. ""As the international scientific community of robotic explorers on Mars grows, the United States and the world look forward to the discoveries Zhurong will make to advance humanity’s knowledge of the Red Planet. I look forward to future international discoveries, which will help inform and develop the capabilities needed to land human boots on Mars."" Space News reported Wednesday that Nelson later charged the 's initiatives like the Zhurong rover add ""a new element as to whether or not we want to get serious and get a lot of activity going in landing humans back on the surface of the moon."" 'S ""It is a very aggressive competitor,"" Nelson later noted. ""They’re going to be landing humans on the moon. That should tell us something about our need to get off our duff and get our Human Landing System program going vigorously."" Notably, China and Russian space agency Roscosmos announced in March that they would partner to build a lunar research station, possibly on the moon’s surface. The two countries did not set a timeline for the proposal. In addition, Russia -- a decades-long partner of -- said last month that the nation might withdraw from the International Space Station as soon as 2025. Former Sen. Bill Nelson, newly-appointed administrator, speaks during a Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation confirmation hearing, Wednesday, April 21, 2021 on Capitol Hill in Washington. China launched the core element of its own Tianhe space station into orbit in April – a project the country aims to complete by the end of 2022. In an impassioned plea, Nelson urged for help funding 's own Artemis Human Landing System through the White House's American Jobs Plan legislation. In total, Nelson requested more than $11 billion for both the ambitious program and facilities upgrades. The 2022 budget request is a $1.5 billion increase from 2021. The New York Times reported on Tuesday that a new bill known as the Endless Frontier Act that would allocate $120 billion into scientific innovation had advanced past a procedural hurdle in the Senate – spurred by what the paper deemed to be a ""sense of urgency in Congress to bolster the United States’ ability to compete with China.""

After a 24-hour delay due to a faulty temperature sensor in ground equipment, the United Launch Alliance Atlas 5 rocket – with two small rideshare payloads – lifted off from Florida's Cape Canaveral Space Force Station at 1:37 p.m. . The rocket used a Russian-built -180 main engine and strap-on solid-fuel boosters. ""Separation confirmed! The United Launch Alliance #AtlasV rocket has deployed the fifth Space Based Infrared System Geosynchronous Earth Orbit satellite to save lives through early warning missile detection,"" announced in a tweet. ""144,"" tweeted President Tory Bruno, in reference to 's 144th successful mission. ""Thank you to our mission partners for the tremendous teamwork as we processed and launched this asset that provides powerful surveillance and critical capabilities to protect our warfighters,"" Vice President of Government and Commercial Programs Gary Wentz said in a statement. ""We are proud to work with the U.S. Space Force to continue to meet the national security needs of our country."" The approximately 10-and-a-half-minute launch was the fifth in the series of space-based infrared system satellites, which are meant to replace the Defense Support Program constellation of surveillance satellites. It was also the 87th launch of the 194-foot-tall Atlas V rocket and the 72nd Atlas V to launch from Space Launch Complex-41. Space News reported Tuesday that the spacecraft's ""Technology Demonstration Orbiter"" payloads – -3 and -4 – were successfully deployed and released from the 950,000-pound rocket's Centaur upper stage around 16 and a half minutes after liftoff.

Nearly 43 minutes after liftoff, the satellite separated and deployed as well to a geosynchronous transfer orbit. A geosynchronous orbit is a high Earth orbit that allows satellites to match the rotation of the Earth, according to Space.com.

2021-05-13,Fox,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/cyberattacks-america-biden-watch,America under siege on Biden's watch as cyberattackers cripple the country,"'The Five' discuss Biden's economic policy 'disaster' They cut off a pipeline to the Eastern Seaboard for days, tried to poison a Florida water-treatment plant, held hospital systems hostage and stole an undetermined trove of information in the SolarWinds hack – all as the Biden administration searches for a way to respond. Cyberattacks are on the rise, and they’re increasingly targeting major infrastructure installations, like transportation hubs, energy facilities and utility companies. The technology to prevent many of these attacks already exists, experts say, and hacks targeting critical infrastructure, which can threaten American lives, are akin to acts of war. So President Biden signed an executive order Wednesday to strengthen U.S. cyberdefenses and bolster the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, known as . ‘ 21ST ’ ""U.S. public and private sector entities increasingly face sophisticated malicious cyber activity from both nation-state actors and cyber criminals,"" the White House said in a statement. ""These incidents share commonalities, including insufficient cybersecurity defenses that leave public and private sector entities more vulnerable to incidents."" The administration also called on private companies to increase spending on their own cybersecurity, but it stopped short of bolstering offensive capabilities. Biden’s executive actions would likely require federal agencies and contractors to meet minimum cybersecurity protocols – but that doesn’t go nearly far enough, according to former Rep. Denver Riggleman, R-Va., who spent 20 years in intelligence for the military, the National Security Agency and in private industry. ""We need to pick the first country that f---- with us in a cyber way and bring them to their knees,"" he told Fox News Wednesday. His solution is dramatically ramping up spending for offensive cyber capabilities, and then using them disproportionately in response to any future attacks, especially when they are linked to the governments of Russia, China, Iran or North Korea. ""We choose a target that we have access to, and once we identify that target, we take out that target – and we then we [should] take it another step,"" he said. ""If you want to come in and hit the Colonial Pipeline, which only serves several states, we're going to hit your major hub and want to take down half your country for a week."" Nongovernment hackers should be treated like terrorists and squashed as well, he said, because cyberattacks targeting major points of infrastructure have similar effects as terrorism, even if they’re motivated by profit. ""If we had 96 hours with 10 states without gas and power, people would be raiding houses in 72 of those hours,"" Riggleman said. ""The worst cascading effect is the way people react, right? When they don't have power, they don't have water, they don't have energy. It's scary stuff."" Creating that kind of asymmetrical deterrent should pair the increase in cyber offensive spending with funding to modernize the cyberdefenses of U.S. infrastructure, which appears to be glaringly exposed in the wake of numerous recent cyberattacks. ""It's gonna take a flip in resolve, and I would hope that the Biden administration has that resolve,"" he said. For comparison, the Biden administration rolled out new sanctions against Russia after it was implicated in the 2020 SolarWinds hack, which victimized a dozen government agencies, including itself, and about 100 private companies, Microsoft among them. , which is part of the Department of Homeland Security, is slated to receive $2 billion of the department’s $60 billion budget, Riggleman said. And only about $6 million of that goes to incident response. Even without increasing ’s budget, Riggleman said lawmakers on both sides of the aisle need to unite to protect America from its enemies. One way to infuse tens of millions of dollars into the agency immediately, he proposed, would be to redirect funding from nonessential programs, such as if there was $25 million slated for teaching elementary schools how to use computers. ""I think what you need to do is an audit – and if you see things that look ridiculous, we have to come to a point where mission-specific objectives override political objectives as some might define as woke or whatever,"" he said. And there’s no excuse for critical infrastructure facilities that feel the need to have armed guards, locked gates and secured perimeters to overlook their cybersecurity, according to Lior Frenkel, and co-founder of Waterfall Security Solutions. Speaking over the phone from Israel, he told Fox News Wednesday that his company and its competitors already have thousands of facilities in the U.S. and abroad protected by its technology, which thwarts Trojan horse-style ransomware attacks. The solution, he told Fox News Wednesday, is to lock down the direction in which information flows. ""Water can't go up the waterfall – given there's a physical barrier, which is exactly what we do,"" he said. But water, like encrypted data, can still go down, allowing infrastructure facilities to send out information freely to the cloud without being at risk of a cyberattack in the opposite direction. Frenkel said his company serves thousands of infrastructure clients already, about half of them in the energy sector and more in water, chemicals and transportation. : ‘ ’ ""I founded this company because it drives me crazy that it’s so easy to penetrate, remotely, such critical systems that have such a big impact on society – and yet it’s so hard physically,"" he said. ""You have armed guards and security all around it. … But you can hack through the firewall and you're in and can do practically whatever you want."" Biden's Wednesday executive order made no mention of bolstering the United States' offensive cyber capabilities, but it did establish a national Cybersecurity Safety Review Board to investigate future major incidents. The White House did not immediately respond to a Fox News request for comment. As Republicans and Democrats try to negotiate what could be a multitrillion-dollar infrastructure deal in Washington, D.C., experts say whatever they agree upon should acknowledge cybersecurity in all critical new infrastructure projects.",3,4.701637499133316,5.296747057214263,-0.5951095580809476,7

Core, or first-stage, rockets normally don't go into orbit like the Long March 5B, instead making a controlled re-entry shortly after launch. However, this rocket -- launched to carry a module for China's first permanent space station on April 28 -- was not designed with safeguards that would help steer the spacecraft away from land or villages off of Africa's Ivory Coast, where more ""shrapnel"" from a Long March 5B rocket crashed last May. Photos posted to social media showed the long, javelin-like metal poles that damaged buildings, miraculously missing residents. 'S - Dr. Jonathan McDowell, an astronomer at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, explained to Fox News on Friday that while the core's orbit is known ""really well,"" what's uncertain is the density of the atmosphere. The tumbling ""dead hunk of metal"" is traveling at a speed of 18,000 mph ""relatively horizontally"" around the Earth -- a circle that shrinks due to friction with the atmosphere, heating the rocket stage. ""And, eventually, it gets low enough that the drag on it just gets way, way bigger very quickly. And, instead of continuing to orbit it just sort of plummets down and as it plummets down it gets even hotter...the lower of temperature of metals aluminum melt and the thing breaks apart into a bunch of shrapnel,"" he said. The density of the atmosphere also depends on the weather in space. According to , space weather is created by activity on the sun's surface, ""spewing"" gas and particles known as solar wind into space that are charged with electricity. The Earth is largely protected from solar winds due to both the planet's magnetic field and its protective atmosphere, the agency said. Solar activity affects the density of the upper atmosphere, a factor that can impact the time at which the core has slowed down enough to re-enter the atmosphere. ""And, space weather is as hard to predict as Earth weather. So, you know, we can do an okay but...but the further out you're trying to predict the weather, the harder it is to get right,"" McDowell noted. Headwind and the shape of the object also affect how much drag it experiences and its slowing rate, leading to a kind of prediction roulette. ""What they do is they Monte Carlo it. They make a million guesses about what the atmosphere is going to do and how the rocket's going to tumble and throw those darts at a board and see what the distribution of answers is,"" the astrophysicist added. The narrower the distribution of answers -- the smaller the window of time -- the easier it is to predict the weather or rocket re-entry. In this photo released by China's Xinhua News Agency, a Long March 5B rocket carrying a module for a Chinese space station lifts off from the Wenchang Spacecraft Launch Site in Wenchang in southern China's Hainan Province, Thursday, April 29, 2021. China has launched the core module on Thursday for its first permanent space station that will host astronauts long-term. However, the core's speed means that there's still ""no way that you can predict the re-entry time accurately enough to predict the re-entry location in a useful way,"" McDowell said. On social media, comments and questions from concerned Earthlings were flung almost as fast. Were they in the path of the core? McDowell said that while the probability of property damage could not be really small because it has already happened before, there's about a one in 80 billion chance that it would hit those worried about being so unlucky. ? ""Should we be worried about flying? Um, you know, should you be worried about standing in a particular spot on the Earth?"" he asked. ""Here's the thing, you've got to stand somewhere."" Nevertheless, the Federal Aviation Administration told Fox Business on Friday that it was working with the North American Aerospace Defense Command to track any impact the rocket might have on commercial air travel. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said Thursday that the U.S. has no plans to shoot down the 100-foot-long debris. In this Saturday, April 24, 2021 photo made available by , the SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule approaches the International Space Station for docking. SpaceX's four astronauts had barely settled into orbit on Friday, April 23, when they were ordered back into their spacesuits because of a potential collision with orbiting junk. It turns out there was no threat, the U.S. Space Command acknowledged Monday, April 26. The error is under review. Wang Wenbing, a spokesperson for China's Foreign Ministry, told reporters on Friday that Chinese authorities would release information about the re-entry of the rocket in a ""timely manner"" and that ""the vast majority of the devices will be burnt up and destructed during the reentry process, which has a very low probability of causing harm to aviation activities and the ground."" McDowell told Fox News that the Chinese are ""lying through their teeth"" and ""just playing the odds,"" highlighting that after 's almost 100-ton Skylab fell on a small Australian town in 1979 manufacturers made sure that big rocket stages did not end up abandoned in orbit and included steering and stabilization mechanisms and a restartable engine. ""So, I think there's absolutely no excuse for this kind of big re-entry to be happening,"" he said. : The core's uncontrolled re-entry is also symbolic of a larger issue in space exploration: a ""very serious space traffic problem"" that McDowell is urging nations to address. As space leaders like Russia, China and the U.S. continue to send satellites into orbit and conduct other missions, the probability of collision also increases. When 's SpaceX Crew-2 mission launched to the International Space Station at the end of last month, the astronauts were ordered back in their spacesuits and told to brace for collision with an unknown object. It turned out to be a false alarm, but what if it wasn't? ""I would say if we're carrying on doing what we're doing, we should expect to see in the next few years at least one major accidental satellite collision,"" McDowell said, calling for a ""stronger regime of control."" He said that it was an ""intrinsically global problem"" that cannot be solved by U.S. Space Force alone and needs to be done with diplomacy, international agreements and eventually an ""international space traffic control."" White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki told reporters on Wednesday that the U.S. is committed to ""addressing the risks of growing congestion due to space debris and growing activity in space"" and wants to work together with the international community to ""promote leadership and responsible space behaviors."" ""It's in the shared interests of all nations to act responsibly in space to ensure the safety, stability, security and long-term sustainability of outer space activities,"" she said. According to McDowell, the regulations now in place -- like the 1972 Space Liability Convention -- are a kind of ""hangover"" from the Cold War and do not address new actors and the commercialization of space. He said that while commercial use of space should be encouraged, it should be balanced with responsible management of the outer space environment. ""The overall message from both the junk issue and the re-entry issue is, we need reasonable international governance of humanity's use of outer space,"" he said.

The 100-foot-long object is orbiting the blue marble every 90 minutes, passing north of New York and Beijing and as far south as Chile and New Zealand. ; : While the main stage released the Tianhe, or ""Heavenly Harmony,"" module – the makings of the country's first permanent space station – shortly after the eight-minute mark of the mission, Gizmodo reported that the core stage stayed in space and did not perform a controlled deorbit. Although rocket manufacturers typically take precautionary measures to avoid falling rocket debris, Inverse says the Long March 5B rocket stage is built without a steering booster, stabilization system and restartable engine. Space debris hurtling back toward Earth is a fairly common occurrence. In this Saturday, April 24, 2021, photo made available by , the SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule approaches the International Space Station for docking. SpaceX's four astronauts had barely settled into orbit on Friday, April 23, when they were ordered back into their spacesuits because of a potential collision with orbiting junk. It turns out there was no threat, the U.S. Space Command acknowledged Monday, April 26. The error is under review. The SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule had a close encounter with some orbiting junk last month, though it turned out there was no real threat. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Environmental Satellite, Data and Information Service says that, on average, between 200 and 400 tracked objects enter Earth's atmosphere annually. Most pieces of space debris – continuously amassing since the satellite Sputnik 1 escaped Earth's gravitational pull on Oct. 4, 1957 – burn up in the Earth's atmosphere on their descent. : Of the millions of pieces of space debris estimated to be orbiting the planet, roughly 30,000 are larger than a softball and only around 1,000 are actual spacecraft, reports. The objects are monitored by the U.S. military's Space Surveillance Network and 's Orbital Debris Program Office using radar, telescopes and other space-based systems. Even the smallest debris orbits at a high velocity, which can also be harmful to satellites. National Geographic reports that most space junk is in lower Earth orbit, around 1,250 miles above the planet's surface. Space.com says that how long a piece of space debris takes to fall back to Earth depends on its altitude and that debris left in orbits below 370 miles normally fall back to Earth within a period of several years. Components that survive the fall are likely to hit bodies of water, as Earth's oceans cover 70% of the planet's surface. Data recorded over a period of more than 50 years shows an average of one piece of debris fell back to Earth each day, though there have been no confirmed deaths or serious injuries from people being hit by space debris. However, space debris can, of course, cause some damage depending on where it lands. In 1979, 's almost 100-ton Skylab fell on a small Australian town, the Soviet Union's 43-ton Salyut-7 space station landed in Argentina in 1991 and in May of last year another China Long March 5B rocket released debris over Africa's Ivory Coast after spending a week in low Earth orbit.",3,5.8619022506378125,4.233240631224974,1.6286616194128385,6

""In December of 2017, I made which now is kind of the fateful trip to Moscow,"" explained Marc Polymeropolous, a 26 year veteran of the , who was forced to retire as the ’s official for clandestine operations in Europe after suffering a mysterious traumatic brain injury and debilitating side effects following a trip to Moscow in 2017. ""I woke up in the middle of the night with an incredible case of vertigo, of tinnitus, which is ringing in the ears. I was falling over. I was nauseated,"" Polymeropolous said in an interview with Fox News. ""There was no mistake that something really, really terrifying happened that night in Moscow. I had been in Afghanistan. I spent time in Iraq. This was the most terrifying experience of my life."" The veteran officer was staying at the Marriott Hotel near the Embassy when he was attacked. His case resembles symptoms described by 40 diplomats in Havana serving at the Embassy and a dozen diplomats serving in China who in 2016 began experiencing extreme vertigo and nausea, sometimes following a loud, piercing sound that experts now believe was the result of directed radiofrequency energy in the form of a microwave. '' Senators Mark Warner and Marco Rubio, the top Republican and Democrats heading the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, issued a stern statement acknowledging for the first time officials had been ""attacked,"" suggesting the attacks are ongoing and ""increasing."" Now two cases are being investigated on U.S. soil, including one that allegedly took place last year near the ellipse outside the White House and another that targeted a National Security Council official. Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire has pressed the State Department and intelligence community for years about the alleged attacks on diplomats. In a heated exchange with Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines, she referenced open source reporting of the incident outside the White House. ""One of the incidents described here happened on the ellipse in late 2020. And that's very close to the White House,"" Senator Shaheen said to Haines. : – 'S David Relman of Stanford led the National Academy of Sciences study requested by the State Department which until recently remained classified. The report concluded these diplomats had been targeted by a pulsed radiofrequency. ""A form of microwave energy that we don't typically see in the world around us. It's not the continuous wave energy that comes out of our cell phones or out of our microwaves. It's not that,"" Relman explained. ""It is a high energy, very short delivery of this microwave energy. It's a form that isn't common in the world around us, but is used, for example, by militaries for radar."" The ’s Polymeropolous described the brain fog and loss of long-distance vision. ""It became pretty clear that something pretty terrible happened."" : 'S At first, he says, when he raised the issue with doctors at the , few believed him. He says he is now getting more support from the new director of , William Burns, who promised to help at the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence during the Annual Threat Assessment hearing: ""I said in my confirmation hearing before the Senate that I would make this a very high priority to ensure that my colleagues get the care that they deserve and that we get to the bottom of what caused these incidents and who was responsible. And, I've tried very hard in the three weeks now that I've been at to demonstrate that commitment. I've visited Walter Reed and to thank the wonderful professionals there for the support they've provided."" After facing frustrating bureaucracy for 3 years, Polymeropolous is finally getting treated at Walter Reed’s National Intrepid Center of Excellence, which specializes in traumatic brain injuries. ""There's conventional wisdom that this is a portable weapon, a microwave weapon that we knew the Soviet Union and the Russians certainly developed and tested for a long time. And it's designed to incapacitate. I mean, it's pretty insidious because it also doesn't leave any kind of open scars or wounds,"" Polymeropolous said. ""It's a terror weapon that I think the Russians, in my view, have employed. And they've done so to very good effect because it's caused a great deal of worry and fear among the diplomatic community. The majority of senior government officials, including the intelligence community, believe it's the Russians,"" he said. Now lawmakers on both sides of the aisle want answers from the , State Department, Pentagon and about who is responsible for these attacks that the Senate Select Intelligence Committee says are ongoing and increasing. Senator James Inhofe , the top Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee, recently confirmed he had received a classified briefing but would not divulge any details. ""There’s some confidential things that we are not going to be talking about and that’s one of them,"" he said. Senator Richard Blumenthal also confirmed the briefing.

If Zelenskyy wants to discuss normalizing ties with Russia, he's welcome to come to Moscow, the Russian leader said. The Russian military hasn’t reported the number of additional troops that have been moved to Crimea and parts of southwestern Russia near Ukraine, and it wasn’t immediately clear from Shoigu’s statement if all of them will now be pulled back. The Russian Defense Ministry said the maneuvers in Crimea involved more than 60 ships, over 10,000 troops, around 200 aircraft and about 1,200 military vehicles. The exercise featured the landing of more than 2,000 paratroopers and 60 military vehicles on Thursday. Fighter jets covered the airborne operation. Shoigu flew in a helicopter over the Opuk firing range in Crimea to oversee the exercise. He later declared the drills over, but ordered the military to stand ready to respond to any ""adverse developments"" during 's Defender Europe 2021 exercise. The drills began in March and are to last until June. "" has significantly intensified its military activities in the region,"" Shoigu said. ""Intelligence gathering has increased and the intensity and scope of operational training has been growing. One of the alliance's main coalition groups is being deployed in the Black Sea region."" Russia long has bristled at the deployment of ’s forces near its borders and stepped up its drills as relations with the West have sunk to post-Cold War lows over the annexation of Crimea, Russian meddling in elections, hacking attacks and other issues. Last week, Russia has announced that it would close broad areas of the Black Sea near Crimea to foreign navy ships and state vessels until November, a move that drew Ukrainian protests and raised Western concerns. Russia also announced restrictions on flights near Crimea this week, arguing that they fully conform with the international law. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba warned Tuesday that the Russian buildup across the border is continuing and is ""expected to reach a combined force of over 120,000 troops"" in about a week and urged the West to beef up sanctions against Moscow. Moscow has rejected Ukrainian and Western concerns about the buildup, arguing that it's free to deploy its forces anywhere on the Russian territory and charging that they don't threaten anyone. But at the same time, the Kremlin sternly warned Ukrainian authorities against trying to use force to retake control of the rebel east, where seven years of fighting have killed more than 14,000, saying that Russia could be forced to intervene to protect civilians in the region.",29,6.22137910159166,6.35153237824638,-0.13015327665471954,27

2021-04-16,Fox,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/russia-expels-10-us-diplomats-biden-announces-new-sanctions,Russia expels 10 US diplomats after Biden administration announces new sanctions,"Fox News senior strategic analyst Gen. Jack Keane reacts to President Biden's sweeping sanctions against Russia and U.S. intel backpedaling on the Russian bounty story. Russia on Friday responded in kind to a barrage of new U.S. sanctions, saying it would expel 10 U.S. diplomats and take other retaliatory moves in a tense showdown with Washington. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov also said Moscow will add eight U.S. officials to its sanctions list and move to restrict and stop the activities of U.S. nongovernment organizations from interfering in Russia’s politics. He said the Kremlin suggested that U.S. Ambassador John Sullivan follow the example of his Russian counterpart and head home for consultations. Russia will also move to deny the U.S. Embassy the possibility to hire personnel from Russia and third countries as support staff. The moves follow the sanctions on Russia announced this week by the Biden administration. A '' While the U.S. wields the power to cripple the Russian economy, Moscow lacks levers to respond in kind, although it potentially could hurt American interests in many other ways around the globe. Lavrov noted that while Russia could take ""painful measures"" against American business interests in Russia, it wouldn’t immediately move to do that Russia has denied interfering in the 2020 U.S. presidential election and involvement in the SolarWind hack of federal agencies — the activities punished by the latest U.S. sanctions. The Russian Foreign Ministry warned of an ""inevitable"" retaliation, charging that ""Washington should realize that it will have to pay a price for the degradation of bilateral ties."" The U.S. on Thursday ordered 10 Russian diplomats expelled, targeted dozens of companies and people, and imposed new curbs on Russia’s ability to borrow money. Pundits had predicted that while Moscow would respond in kind to the expulsions, it would refrain from any other significant moves to avoid a further escalation. Russia’s economic potential and its global reach are limited compared with the Soviet Union that competed with the U.S for international influence during the Cold War. Still, Russia’s nuclear arsenal and its leverage in many parts of the world make it a power that Washington needs to reckon with. Aware of that, President Joe Biden called for de-escalating tensions and held the door open for cooperation with Russia in certain areas. Biden said he told Putin in Tuesday’s call that he chose not to impose tougher sanctions for now and proposed to meet in a third country in the summer. Lavrov said the summit offer was being analyzed. Russian President Vladimir Putin attends a meeting with participants of the We Are Together nationwide volunteer campaign via video conference at the Novo-Ogaryovo residence outside Moscow, Russia, Saturday, Dec. 5, 2020. A While the new U.S. sanctions further limited Russia’s ability to borrow money by banning U.S. financial institutions from buying Russian government bonds directly from state institutions, they didn’t target the secondary market. ""It’s very important that there’re no sanctions on secondary debt because that means that non-U.S. persons can buy the debt and sell it to the U.S. persons,"" said Tom Adshead, director of research at Macro-Advisory Ltd, an analytics and advisory company. Tougher restrictions would also hurt Western businesses, inflict significant economic pain on the Russian population and allow Putin to rally anti-U.S. sentiments to shore up his rule. Ramping up sanctions could eventually drive Russia into a corner and provoke even more reckless Kremlin action, such as a potential escalation in Ukraine, which has recently faced a surge in clashes with Russia-backed separatists in the east and a massive Russian troops buildup across the border. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy was in Paris on Friday to discuss the tensions with French President Emmanuel Macron. German Chancellor Angela Merkel was to join them in a call later. Fyodor Lukyanov, a top foreign policy expert who leads the Moscow-based Council for Foreign and Defense Policies, predicted Putin would likely accept Biden’s invitation to join next week’s call on climate change but could drag his feet on accepting the summit offer. ""There is no way to make any deals,"" Lukyanov said. ""There is a mutual antipathy and a total lack of trust."" : He charged that the only practical outcome of the summit could be an agreement to launch long and difficult talks on a replacement to the New nuclear reduction agreement that Russia and the U.S. extended in February for another five years. Lukyanov noted that the growing U.S. pressure will push Russia and China closer together in the long run. ""Closer cooperation with China on coordinating actions to contain the United States will develop more quickly now as the Chinese are interested in that,"" he said. While Russia lacks tools for a symmetrical answer to the U.S. sanctions, ""it has ample capabilities to stimulate changes in the world order,"" he added. Konstantin Kosachev, the Kremlin-connected deputy speaker of the upper house of parliament, said that by hitting Russia with sanctions and proposing a summit at the same time, the U.S. sought to take a commanding stance. ""Russia’s consent would be interpreted as a reflection of its desire to soften the sanctions, allowing the U.S. to secure a dominant position at the meeting, while our refusal to meet would be a convenient pretext for more punitive measures,"" Kosachev wrote on Facebook. He argued that Russia should not rush to accept Biden’s summit offer. ""Revenge is a dish best served cold,"" Kosachev wrote. ""I believe the saying is quite adaptable to a situation when we talk not about revenge but a due answer to aggressive action by an opponent."" Russian President Vladimir Putin speaks after a signing of agreements in New Delhi, India, Friday, Oct. 5, 2018. India has signed a $5 billion deal to buy 5 Russian S-400 air defense systems despite a looming threat of U.S. sanctions on countries that trade with Russia's defense and intelligence sectors. , ' ' Some predicted the U.S. sanctions could discourage Russia from cooperating with the U.S. on international crises. ""The Russian position will grow tougher on Syria, the Iranian nuclear deal and other issues,"" Ivan Timofeev, program director at Russian International Affairs Council, said in a commentary. Instead of acting as a deterrent, he warned, the sanctions would ""only anger Russia and make its policy even tougher."" However, any attempt by Russia to undermine American interests would dangerously escalate tensions with the U.S. and trigger even harder sanctions — something the Kremlin certainly wants to avoid. Despite the soaring tensions, Russia and the U.S. have shared interests in many global hot spots. For example, Moscow fears that instability could spread from Afghanistan to former Soviet republics in Central Asia, and it is interested in a political settlement there. As for Iran, Moscow also doesn’t want to see it with nuclear weapons, despite its friendly ties with Tehran. Lukyanov said that Russia wouldn’t try to use global hot spots to hurt the U.S. and would wait patiently to see them erode U.S. domination.",29,5.1697543069533625,5.893865883944521,-0.7241115769911586,27

Russian hackers exploited vulnerabilities in the private supply chain as well as weaknesses in federal cyber defense, according to the government’s findings. The sanctions block U.S. banks from buying bonds from the Russian Central Bank, hindering Russia’s ability to borrow money.

According to his biography, Vande Hei served as an for Expeditions 15 to 20 and -122, 123, 124, 126 and 127. After three years, Vande Hei was selected as one of nine members of the 20th astronaut class and he completed his training in 2011.

""There are scientists that put a lot of thought into what experiments they want to get done. They're doing the data gathering and the data analysis and writing papers. My job is to facilitate if those things work when it's up there,"" he said. ""I need to make sure that they have the resources they need. If something needs to be troubleshot, I'll help out with the troubleshooting,"" Vande Hei continued.

The most prominent political foe of Russian President Vladimir Putin was arrested Jan. 17 upon his return from Germany, where he spent five months recuperating from the nerve agent poisoning he blamed on the Kremlin. Russian authorities have denied the allegations.

Last week, a court in Moscow sent Navalny to prison for two years and eight months for violating terms of his probation while recuperating in Germany. The probation stemmed from a 2014 embezzlement conviction that Navalny has rejected as fabricated and the European Court of Human Rights has ruled to be unlawful. Navalny was back in court Friday on a charge of defaming a World War veteran who was featured in a video last year advertising constitutional amendments that allowed an extension of Putin's rule. Navalny called the people in the video ""corrupt stooges,"" ""people without conscience"" and ""traitors."" He rejected the libel charges as part of Kremlin efforts to disparage him and could face a fine or community service, if convicted. ' ' European Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said after visiting Russia last week that the 27-nation bloc must take a firm stance in its relations with Russia and ponder new sanctions in the wake of Navalny’s prison sentence. While Borrell was meeting with Lavrov, Moscow announced the expulsion of diplomats from Germany, Poland and Sweden for attending protests in support of Navalny. The three countries responded in kind Monday, each expelling a Russian diplomat.

Borrell has said he plans to submit proposals for possible actions against Russia when he chairs the next meeting of the bloc’s foreign ministers on Feb. 22. Navalny's arrest triggered a wave of protests across Russia that drew tens of thousands of people to the streets in the largest show of discontent in years. Authorities responded with a sweeping crackdown, detaining about 11,000 people across Russia. Many protesters were fined or given jail sentences ranging from seven to 15 days. The United States and the European Union have urged Russia to release Navalny and to end the crackdown on protests. The Kremlin has accused them of meddling in Russia’s internal affairs and said it would not listen to Western criticism of Navalny’s sentencing and police actions against his supporters. Lavrov accused the West of pursuing the ""aggressive containment of Russia"" to punish the country for its independent foreign policy.",29,5.114961849146955,4.088354378625888,1.0266074705210668,27
2021-01-07,Fox,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/justice-department-federal-court-system-hit-russian-hack,"Justice Department, federal court system hit by Russian hack","Ex- Sam Palmisano and Cyber Readiness Institute Managing Director Kiersten Todt join 'Special Report' with analysis The Justice Department and the federal court system disclosed on Wednesday that they were among the dozens of U.S. government agencies and private businesses compromised by a massive, monthslong cyberespionage campaign that U.S. officials have linked to elite Russian hackers. The extent of the damage was unclear. ' ' The department said that 3% of its Microsoft Office 365 email accounts were potentially affected, but did not say to whom those accounts belonged. There are no indications that classified systems were affected, the agency said. Office 365 isn't just email but a collaborative computing environment, which means that shared documents were also surely accessed, said Dmitri Alperovitch, former chief technical officer of the cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike. Separately, the Administrative Office of U.S. Courts informed federal judicial bodies across the nation that the courts’ nationwide case management system was breached. That potentially gave the hackers access to sealed court documents, whose contents are highly sensitive. 'S : The Justice Department said that on Dec. 24 it detected ""previously unknown malicious activity"" linked to the broader intrusions of federal agencies revealed earlier that month, according to a statement from spokesman Marc Raimondi. Separately, the court office said on its website that ""an apparent compromise"" of the U.S. judiciary's case management and electronic case file system was under investigation. : ' ' The Department of Homeland Security was scouring the system, it said, and cited a particular risk to sealed court filings, whose disclosure could jeopardize a lot more than active criminal investigations. ""The potential reach is vast. The actual reach is probably significant,"" said a federal court official who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to disclose the information. The official confirmed that the scope of the compromise was national but it was not clear how widespread. The sealed court files, if indeed breached, could hold information about national security, trade secrets and wiretap transcripts, along with financial data from bankruptcy cases and the names of confidential informants in criminal cases, the official added. ? A On Tuesday, federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies formally implicated Russia in the intrusions, calling them part of a suspected intelligence-gathering operation. President Donald Trump had previously questioned that consensus, suggesting without foundation that China could be to blame. The hacking campaign was extraordinary in scale, with the intruders stalking through government agencies including the Treasury and Commerce departments, defense contractors and telecommunications companies for months by the time the breach was discovered. Experts say that gave the foreign agents ample time to collect data that could be highly damaging to U.S. national security, although the scope of the breaches and exactly what information was sought is unknown. An estimated 18,000 organizations were seeded with malicious code that piggybacked on popular network-management software from an Austin, Texas, company called SolarWinds. But only a subset are believed to have been compromised. Tuesday's statement said that fewer than 10 federal government agencies have so far been identified as having been hacked. Johns Hopkins cyberespionage expert Thomas Rid said the 3% figure of email accounts accessed at Justice may not sound like a lot, but that it doesn’t mean that the hackers ""didn’t get to the interesting stuff."" Cybersecurity experts responding to the hack say highly skilled cyberspies of the caliber behind the SolarWinds hack are apt to keep their footprint as small as possible to avoid detection — targeting only high-value email and documents. Rid wondered how sure the Justice Department could be about the extent of its compromise. ""How good is their own visibility given that U.S. government agencies totally missed the breach in the first place?"" he said. ""Are they really on top of the problem? Are we only really seeing the tip of the iceberg?"" The breach was discovered by FireEye, a prominent cybersecurity company, on its network. It then identified and notified other victims. 6 , Experts expect the severity of the hack and the number of victims identified to increase over time. ""History tells us that if you have a large breach, not just in one organization but across an entire government — an entire sector — it will take a long time to identify who are the victims and how badly they are compromised,"" said Rid. Microsoft declined to comment on long the intruders were reading emails in the Justice Department's Office 365 environment, which is typically a cloud-based service hosted by the software provider.",3,5.9719715011454255,2.186518961645843,3.7854525394995826,0

The statement represented the U.S. government's first formal attempt to assign responsibility for the breaches at multiple agencies and to assign a possible motive for the operation. The agencies rejected President Trump's claim that China might be to blame. The seal is seen before a news conference at headquarters in Washington. The agencies said the hacks appeared to be part of ""intelligence-gathering,"" suggesting the evidence so far pointed to a Russian spying effort, rather than an attempt to damage or disrupt U.S. government operations. ""This work indicates that an Advanced Persistent Threat actor, likely Russian in origin, is responsible for most or all of the recently discovered, ongoing cyber compromises of both government and non-governmental networks,"" the statement read.

During an appearance on the Mark Levin Show last month, Pompeo said the U.S. ""can say pretty clearly that it was the Russians that engaged in this activity."" But Trump, in a series of tweets late last month, sought to downplay the severity of the hack and raised the unsubstantiated idea that China could be responsible. Officials said the hack began as early as March when malicious code was slipped into updates to SolarWinds software that monitors computer networks. Microsoft helped respond to the breach with cybersecurity firm FireEye, which discovered the hack when the security firm itself was targeted.

""We are still doing the forensics. We don’t even know how bad this is,"" he said. ""We are supposed to detect these threats… and preempt them before they cause harm.""

Russian President Vladimir Putin was at the headquarters of the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service Sunday Reuters reported, calling the agency’s services a crucial guarantee of Russia’s ""sovereign, democratic, independent development,"" which experts see as a victory lap amidst the major attack on U.S. cyberspace. : ? Last week, both Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, and Attorney General Bill Barr pointed to Russia when asked about the source of the attack. Pompeo who was the director of before becoming the Secretary of State, became the first member of the Trump administration to put blame on Russia last Friday in an interview on ""The Mark Levin Show."" The attorney general echoed Pompeo on Monday. ""It certainly appears to be the Russians,"" Barr said. President Trump downplayed the hack when he tweeted ""The Cyber Hack is far greater in Fake News Media than in actuality,"" and pointed to China being possible culprit. Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, said in an interview with Chuck Todd of this past Sunday that he is disappointed with President Trump's response. ""We've come to recognize that the president has a blind spot when it comes to Russia,"" he said. Fox News reported earlier this week, in a sign of the severity of the attack, the president’s National Security Adviser Robert O’Brien returned earlier from his trip to Europe to coordinate the government’s response. ""Some issues are too sensitive to discuss,"" he said on Christmas Eve when asked about the details of the operation. , - 'S President-elect Joe Biden called Trump’s response ""irrational"" blaming the administration for failing ""to prioritize cybersecurity."" Biden, who will take office in less than a month, added, ""This attack constitutes a grave risk to our national security."" Former chief Hoffman said this will be one of the issues the incoming administration will have to handle with great care. ""Every single nominee who testifies for a position in the intelligence community in the Biden administration is going to be asked this question,"" he said when describing how the U.S. administration will respond eventually. Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle are now asking for a more comprehensive policy against Russia. Sen.

Experts say the consequences will not be limited to a targeted response in cyberspace. Anna Borshchevskaya, a senior fellow at the Washington Institute, says the U.S. shifted foreign policy priority to China in recent years as Russia is now seen as a declining power and cannot really pose a serious threat. ""This cyberattack once again highlights that this vision is wrong. Russia very much does pose a serious challenge, and it need not be a rising power to do so,"" Borshchevskaya said. ""We usually do not get Russia right. We vacillate between two extremes — call it a weak declining power on its way down, and then when a major Russia-driven crisis erupts and takes us by surprise, we elevate it to a genius-like status."" She believes the U.S. will need to handle Russia more strategically. Russia and China are different, but the challenges they pose cannot be overlooked. A senior fellow for Cyber Security at the Council on Foreign Relations, David Fidler suggested this attack should be a turning point on how the U.S. government and the private sector handles cybersecurity. According to Fidler, ""The Russian cyber operations reveal sustained vulnerabilities in the public and private sectors that cannot be mitigated by threatening to impose ‘costs’ on those seeking to do the United States harm in cyberspace.""",3,3.224693655600883,1.1771373019603268,2.047556353640556,0

There may be another group of hackers at work in the wake of the devastating SolarWinds attack. A Microsoft blog hints at a second hacking attempt not related to the initial hack of the SolarWinds software. In that first attack, Russian actors hacked software updates for popular network monitoring tool SolarWinds Orion, described as a ""supply chain"" hack. As a result, multiple government agencies were breached. A number of Big Tech companies have also installed SolarWinds software, including Cisco, Intel and ware, according to The Wall Street Journal. , ""In an interesting turn of events, the investigation of the whole SolarWinds compromise led to the discovery of an additional malware,"" Microsoft said in the post. In all, the attack could have impacted as many as 18,000 of SolarWinds' customers, the company said. Despite the second attack going after SolarWinds' Orion product, Microsoft determined it is ""likely unrelated to this compromise and used by a different threat actor,"" widely assumed to be another cybercriminal organization. In the blog post, Microsoft described the additional malware discovered as ""a small persistence backdoor in the form of a file,"" referring to a Dynamic Link Library. Files with a ""."" extension are commonly found in Windows. Unlike the original attack, ""this malicious does not have a digital signature, which suggests that this may be unrelated"" to the first attack, Microsoft explained. Redmond, Wash.-based Microsoft has not identified the malware by name, but analysis by security researchers at Palo Alto Networks refer to it as ""Supernova."" There’s been some confusion because security researchers thought that Supernova was possibly tied to the first attack, according to et. However, the news outlet reported that is not the case, citing a follow-up analysis from Microsoft's security teams. The upshot is companies that have SolarWinds with Supernova need to handle it as a separate attack. '' Experts believe there is more to be uncovered about the attacks and how widespread they were. ""There is still much we don't know, including exactly how the supply chain hack was accomplished, what other vectors were used besides SolarWinds, how many victims were impacted, what the adversary's objectives were and what information they were able to obtain, what they will do with that information, and more,"" Suzanne Spaulding, advisor to Nozomi Networks and former undersecretary of cyber and infrastructure, said in a statement sent to Fox News.

The and work closely together under the Department of Defense, and are both overseen by four star Gen. Paul M. Nakasone. The push to separate them during President Trump’s final days in office, is the latest move by the Trump administration to shake up the Pentagon. Miller was named acting secretary in early November, after Trump unexpectedly sacked Defense Secretary Mark Esper. Esper had condemned the use of the Insurrection Act during nationwide protests this summer. The 1807 Act would have allowed Trump to deploy National Guard troops within the U.S. Miller continued the Pentagon shake-up by hiring loyal Trump officials and firing head of the Pentagon’s Defeat Task Force Christopher P. Maier, earlier this month. The U.S. also withdrew thousands of troops from the Middle East and Africa. Smith’s letter Thursday condemned not only the apparent method considered for the cyber defense split, but the timing. ""Any action to sever the dual-hat relationship could have grave impacts on our national security, especially during a time that the country is wrestling with what may be the most damaging cyber-attack in our country’s history,"" he wrote in his letter to Miller and chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Army Gen.

2020-12-19,Fox,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/cyberattack-russia-trump-rebecca-grant,Rebecca Grant: Cyberattacks against US will intensify — Biden must bolster ability to defend and strike back,"Former Chief of Station Dan Hoffman says ‘we still don’t know’ how much information Russians accessed during the attack. The recently discovered massive cyberattack on U.S. government and industry computer networks by a foreign adversary isn’t the first nor will it be the last such hostile action. While the Trump administration has strengthened U.S. defenses and revved up America’s cyber offense, it’s clear that the incoming Biden administration will need to do a lot more because the attacks are becoming increasingly sophisticated. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Friday that ""we can say pretty clearly that it was the Russians"" who launched the cyberattack, carried out by embedding malware into several U.S. government agencies and businesses. However, President Trump sought to downplay the attacks in two tweets Saturday. '' ‘ ’ ""The Cyber Hack is far greater in the Fake News Media than in actuality,"" the president tweeted. ""I have been fully briefed and everything is well under control. Russia, Russia, Russia is the priority chant when anything happens because Lamestream is, for mostly financial reasons, petrified of discussing the possibility that it may be China ."" Now, of course, Russia did it. I have no trouble believing Russian President Vladimir Putin would approve such a move because it fits into his much larger strategy to tear down American power. But Trump is right; China is also capable of pulling off this mischief. So what happens now? If you are anticipating a dramatic U.S. response against Russia, don’t hold your breath. The first response was a Washington political fight. Increasing our cybersecurity ought to be a bipartisan issue. But sadly, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., responded to the cyberattack with partisan fury aimed at Trump. In a statement Friday night, Pelosi said ""the Trump Administration has for four years turned a blind eye to Putin’s attacks."" Piling on, Obama administration Director of National Intelligence James Clapper told that the Russian hack was a massive intelligence failure. Time for a fact check: Pelosi is wrong. The Trump administration freed the U.S. Cyber Command to roam and maneuver in bad-actor networks, with new rules issued in a presidential directive in September 2018. President-elect Joe Biden was right when he said Thursday: ""A good defense isn’t enough; we need to disrupt and deter our adversaries from undertaking significant cyberattacks in the first place."" But then he jumped into political attack mode. ""I will not stand idly by in the face of cyber assaults on our nation,"" Biden said, as if Trump was standing idly by. Despite the faux shock from Biden, Pelosi and others, our nation’s leaders from both political parties have known for years that Russia is a nimble and evil adversary in cyberspace. The problem became obvious when Russia shut down Estonia with a devastating cyberattack in April 2007. Estonia revamped its entire cybersecurity structure. Today ’s cybersecurity center of excellence is based in Estonia. So what happened here in America? Years of failure to invest in proper secure software and hardware left government networks vulnerable. Elected officials of both political parties can share the blame. Importantly, the government computer networks that have been hacked are not the super-secret networks, which are more protected. We know of a number of cyberattacks against the U.S. government in recent years. For example, China hacked the U.S. Office of Personnel Management and caused a data breach affecting 20 million Americans, including current and former federal employees and applicants for federal jobs. When word leaked out about this attack in 2015, the Obama-Biden administration chose not to blame China publicly. Clapper, who was then serving as director of national intelligence, told Congress that China was just engaged in ""passive intelligence collection"" and had not launched a real cyberattack. ""You have to kind of salute the Chinese for what they did"" he said, in admiration of China’s technical skill. Russia, China, Iran, North Korea and others have accelerated their cyberattacks in recent years and no doubt will continue to do so. According to Crowdstrike’s ""2019 Global Threat Report"", there are ""more than 240 billion events [computer hacks or attempted hacks] every 24 hours — more than the number of tweets Twitter processes in an entire year."" The Crowdstrike report shows that the Russians are masters of cyberattacks. Russian intrusions took on average just 18 seconds to break out from gaining entry into a computer network to spread through the network. China was slower at four minutes on average — but some Chinese attacks needed only 12 seconds. Defenders have just seconds to respond. That’s getting harder and harder. Understand that while cyberdefense is important, the game has shifted. Cyberwar is a lightning duel of offense, intrusion and intimidation. The keys to success are automation to respond instantly and going on offense. This is why Congress and President Trump gave the U.S. Cyber Command strong new powers in late 2018. Given a longer leash, Cyber Command acted immediately. American ""military hackers are breaking into foreign networks, striking at enemy hackers and planting cyber bombs that would disable infrastructure in the event of a conflict,"" reported Ken Dilanian on June 23, 2019 in a story on the News website headlined ""Under Trump, U.S. military ramps up cyber offensive against other countries."" But while counter-hacking into Russia’s power grid and other vital infrastructure can create deterrence, U.S. officials are very reluctant to act overtly. Here are four reasons for this. The intelligence community likes to watch Russia and other intruders move through computer networks and conduct low-grade, daily attacks. When cyber intruders use known paths, risks are contained. The U.S. Cyber Command can even gain information on adversary capabilities. Striking back alerts the Russians and other attackers, and forces them to seek new means of entry. That’s more dangerous. Not everyone approves of this approach, but it’s a factor. Russia and the United States have until Feb. 5 to renew or cancel the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty . Some will say this is no time to provoke President Putin with cyber retaliation. Cyber experts also fear accidental damage. ""It’s complicated,"" Clapper said Friday. No kidding.

Right now Russia, China, North Korea, Iran and others don’t know all the U.S. can do to them in a cyberattack. Let’s keep it that way, this argument goes. Unfortunately, Russia has pioneered cyberwar and excels at it. Team Trump empowered America’s cyberwarriors to match enemies move for move.

2020-12-19,Fox,https://www.foxnews.com/tech/hacked-networks-burned-down-to-the-ground,Hacked networks will need to be burned 'down to the ground',"Ex-White House Chief Information Officer Theresa Payton joins 'Bill Hemmer Reports' to assess cyberattack on federal agencies It's going to take months to kick elite hackers widely believed to be Russian out of the U.S. government networks they have been quietly rifling through since as far back as March in Washington's worst cyberespionage failure on record. Experts say there simply are not enough skilled threat-hunting teams to duly identify all the government and private-sector systems that may have been hacked. FireEye, the cybersecurity company that discovered the intrusion into U.S. agencies and was among the victims, has already tallied dozens of casualties. It's racing to identify more. ""We have a serious problem. We don't know what networks they are in, how deep they are, what access they have, what tools they left,"" said Bruce Schneier, a prominent security expert and Harvard fellow. : FireEye offices in Milpitas, Calif. It's not clear exactly what the hackers were seeking, but experts say it could include nuclear secrets, blueprints for advanced weaponry, -19 vaccine-related research and information for dossiers on key government and industry leaders. Many federal workers — and others in the private sector — must presume that unclassified networks are teeming with spies. Agencies will be more inclined to conduct sensitive government business on Signal, WhatsApp and other encrypted smartphone apps. ""We should buckle up. This will be a long ride,"" said Dmitri Alperovitch, co-founder and former chief technical officer of the leading cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike. ""Cleanup is just phase one."" The only way to be sure a network is clean is ""to burn it down to the ground and rebuild it,"" Schneier said. : ' ' Imagine a computer network as a mansion you inhabit, and you are certain a serial killer as been there. ""You don't know if he's gone. How do you get work done? You kind of just hope for the best,"" he said. Deputy White House press secretary Brian Morgenstern told reporters Friday that national security adviser Robert O'Brien has sometimes been leading multiple daily meetings with the , the Department of Homeland Security and the intelligence community, looking for ways to mitigate the hack. He would not provide details, ""but rest assured we have the best and brightest working hard on it each and every single day."" The Democratic chairs of four House committees given classified briefings on the hack by the Trump administration issued a statement complaining that they ""were left with more questions than answers."" ""Administration officials were unwilling to share the full scope of the breach and identities of the victims,"" they said. Morgenstern said earlier that disclosing such details only helps U.S. adversaries. President Donald Trump has not commented publicly on the matter, but Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on a conservative talk show Friday, ""I think it's the case that now we can say pretty clearly that it was the Russians that engaged in this activity."" : The sign outside the National Security Agency campus in Fort Meade, Md. What makes this hacking campaign so extraordinary is its scale — 18,000 organizations were infected from March to June by malicious code that piggybacked on popular network-management software from an Austin, Texas, company called SolarWinds. Only a sliver of those infections were activated to allow hackers inside. FireEye says it has identified dozens of examples, all ""high-value targets."" Microsoft, which has helped respond, says it has identified more than 40 government agencies, think tanks, government contractors, non-governmental organizations and technology companies infiltrated by the hackers, 75% in the United States. Florida became the first state to acknowledge falling victim to a SolarWinds hack. Officials told The Associated Press on Friday that hackers apparently infiltrated the state's health care administration agency and others. SolarWinds' customers include most Fortune 500 companies, and it's U.S. government clients are rich with generals and spymasters. The difficulty of extracting the suspected Russian hackers' tool kits is exacerbated by the complexity of SolarWinds' platform, which has dozen of different components. ""This is like doing heart surgery, to pull this out of a lot of environments,"" said Edward Amoroso, of Cyber. Security teams then have to assume that the patient is still sick with undetected so-called ""secondary infections"" and set up the cyber equivalent of closed-circuit monitoring to make sure the intruders are not still around, sneaking out internal emails and other sensitive data. That effort will take months, Alperovitch said. If the hackers are indeed from Russia's foreign intelligence agency, as experts believe, their resistance may be tenacious. When they hacked the White House, the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the State Department in 2014 and 2015 ""it was a nightmare to get them out,"" Alperovitch said. ""It was the virtual equivalent of hand-to-hand combat"" as defenders sought to keep their footholds, ""to stay buried deep inside"" and move to other parts of the network where ""they thought that they could remain for longer periods of time."" ""We're likely going to face the same in this situation as well,"" he added. 'S 5 , 18K FireEye executive Charles Carmakal said the intruders are especially skilled at camouflaging their movements. Their software effectively does what a military spy often does in wartime — hide among the local population, then sneak out at night and strike. ""It's really hard to catch some of these,"" he said. Rob Knake, the White House cybersecurity director from 2011 to 2015, said the harm to the most critical agencies in the U.S. government — defense and intelligence, chiefly — from the SolarWinds hacking campaign is going to be limited ""as long as there is no evidence that the Russians breached classified networks."" During the 2014-15 hack, ""we lost access to unclassified networks but were able to move all operations to classified networks with minimal disruptions,"" he said via email. The Pentagon has said it has so far not detected any intrusions from the SolarWinds campaign in any of its networks — classified or unclassified. , - 'S Given the fierce tenor of cyberespionage — the U.S., Russia and China all have formidable offensive hacking teams and have been penetrating each others' government networks for years — many American officials are wary of putting anything sensitive on government networks. Fiona Hill, the top Russia expert at the National Security Council during much of the Trump administration, said she always presumed no government system was secure. She ""tried from the beginning not to put anything down"" in writing that was sensitive. ""But that makes it more difficult to do business."" Amoroso, of Cyber, recalled the famous pre-election dispute in 2016 over classified emails sent over a private server set up by Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton when she was secretary of state.

The Department of Energy acknowledged it was among the agencies that had been hacked. U.S. The attack, if authorities can prove it was carried out by Russia as experts believe, creates a fresh foreign policy problem for Trump in his final days in office. Trump's silence on the matter has garnered scrutiny from both sides of the aisle, especially when paired with his past handling of issues concerning Russia, including eliminating a White House cybersecurity adviser and downplaying Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. Romney said the attack illustrates an ""alarming U.S. vulnerability,"" and an ""apparent cyber warfare weakness."" ""It's past time for a national security re-set that prioritizes cybersecurity capabilities and defenses,"" he said. Thomas Bossert, a former Trump Homeland Security adviser, said in an opinion article in The New York Times earlier this week that the U.S. should now act as if the Russian government had gained control of the networks it has penetrated.

Among other messages, he warned Russians to look out for foreign interference in next year's parliamentary elections. It is bound to happen, he said, and Russia should be ready.

Amid revelations about massive hacking of government and private sector systems since March and that Russia's Foreign Intelligence Service, the , is probably behind it, Putin's words seemed to turn reality on its head. The Trump administration has not accused Russia and Russia has denied doing it. But concerns about this hack grow as tech experts try to get a handle on the scope of the operation. The departments of Commerce, Treasury, Homeland Security and the Pentagon were affected. The U.S. agency that controls the nuclear stockpile said its systems were compromised, but that the hack did not affect ""mission essential national security functions,"" according to a Department of Energy spokesperson. Russian Presidential candidate, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin delivers a speech during a rally of his supporters at the Luzhniki stadium in Moscow on Feb. 23, 2012.

Nearly half of the affected companies were technology firms entrusted with security. Thousands more may have been hacked. Microsoft said this was ""not espionage as usual."" The hack was an act of recklessness that created a serious technological vulnerability for the U.S. and the world, Microsoft said. Several other countries were targeted but the U.S. was hit worst. The hackers showed a new level of stealth, using Texas-based Solar Winds Software to infiltrate computer networks, taking the footprint far from Russia, and the malware attached may still be working. Connecticut Sen. Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat, tweeted ""Russia's cyberattack left me deeply alarmed, in fact downright scared.""

Just how competent is Russian intelligence is with budget strains of a ruble, the Russian currency, in freefall and oil prices dropping all under the press of international sanctions? Pellicciari said Russia throws resources at areas it identifies as priority. Spies, he said, are a priority and Putin's support base, particularly in the lower classes is with, ""Big Brother watching us, because he protects us."" But Italian journalist Anna Zafesova casts doubt on the state of Russian spycraft, pointing to the recent botched poisonings of former Russian spy Sergei Skripal in Salisbury, England, and Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny in Siberia. In both cases, the poisoners were identified, called out, and their movements detailed in the press albeit amidst Russian denials. Navalny pointed out recently that if Russia has people dying on gurneys in emergency room corridors, the state of its spy agencies must be shabby, too. And perhaps that extends to hackers. ""If you were smart -- a good hacker -- you wouldn't go to work for - you go to Silicon Valley, the ,"" she told Fox News. ""You go get paid in dollars."" But the crowd is known to be driven by patriotism. If Russia was directly involved, it is not clear what the supposed hackers and their alleged paymasters in the Kremlin would do with the data it siphoned out. Now caught, they may try to lash out, some fear. Pellicciari thinks that Russia's endgame with the United States is that Russia wants its old superpower role back. ""They want to negotiate new spheres of influence with the United States. They want a sort of coordinated disagreement, coordinated competition,"" he said. It's not looking for a real partnership or collaboration, Zafesova said, because Russia knows at this point it has nothing to offer the U.S. Few details are known to the wider public about the mass hacking.

The direct-ascent, anti-satellite missile test took place Tuesday, an official at U.S. Space Command told Fox News. To date, Russia has demonstrated two types of space weapons, the agency says. “Russia has made space a warfighting domain by testing space-based and ground-based weapons intended to target and destroy satellites,” U.S. Army Gen. James Dickinson -- the leader of the Space Command -- said in a statement. “This fact is inconsistent with Moscow’s public claims that Russia seeks to prevent conflict in space.” Dickinson added that Moscow is looking to “exploit U.S. reliance on space-based systems.” “We stand ready and committed to deter aggression and defend our Nation and our allies from hostile acts in space,” he continued. The U.S. Space Command says Russia has completed several tests of a ground-based weapon system “capable of destroying satellites in low Earth orbit.” “If this weapon is tested on an actual satellite or used operationally, it will cause a large debris field that could endanger commercial satellites and irrevocably pollute the space domain,” it warned. The other weapon system Russia has demonstrated – once in 2017 and again this year -- is space-based, according to the U.S. Space Command.

Jack Keane reacts. Public and private agencies and businesses worldwide have been left urgently trying to determine if they have been hit by what could amount to one of the most extensive hacking campaigns in recent decades. The fallout continues less than 48 hours after the U.S. government issued an emergency warning Sunday mandating government users disconnect from the breached network-management software, SolarWinds. ""In a nutshell, SolarWinds' Orion product provides centralized monitoring across an organization's entire stack. That means the attackers who were able to compromise this platform had an extremely high level of access to all of these client systems,"" David Kennedy, of TrustedSec told Fox News. A former hacker for the National Security Agency and the Marine Corps, Kennedy also noted that ""since this type of attack is so stealthy, and the attackers used a legitimate piece of software to backdoor their own malicious code, it can be very difficult for companies to identify if they were part of this attack."" As it stands now, the U.S. State Department, Department of Homeland Security , and elements of the Department of Defense have reported being compromised. Those government branches join earlier assessments confirming that the Departments of Treasury and Commerce had been breached in what investigators believe to be a mass-scale Russian intelligence operation. However, SolarWinds' clientele roster traverses some 300,000 organizations – including other highly-sensitive federal agencies ranging from the Department of Justice and the Centers for Disease Control – as well as thousands of private companies. Almost all Fortune 500 companies are reported to use SolarWinds products to scan their networks, including major defense contractors such as Boeing, according to the New York Times. The technology company said in its security advisory on Tuesday that no more than 18,000 customers had downloaded the maligned software, which essentially allowed hackers to infiltrate systems undetected for up to nine months. In its regulatory disclosure, SolarWinds surmised that malicious code was inserted into updates of its Orion network management software disseminated between March and June this year. ""We have been advised that this incident was likely the result of a highly sophisticated, targeted, and manual supply chain attack by an outside nation-state,"" the company stated. ""But we have not independently verified the identity of the attacker."" However, investigators and cyber experts are already pointing the finger at Moscow, which has denied any involvement. Nonetheless, preliminary reviews of the encroachments suspect that the sophistication of the attacks lends itself to the work of Russia's Foreign Intelligence Service . The belief that the is behind the attacks stems from the hackers being especially judicious in drawing data from particular targets. ""Given the list of organizations using SolarWind's Orion platform, the potential impact could expose highly sensitive information and compromise national security,"" said Randy Watkins, Chief Technology Officer. ""Since the attacks are associated with a nation-state, widely expected to be Russia, the intent behind the attack could be anything from policy leverage and military strategy to the theft of weapons system designs."" This file photo shows an -illuminated wireless router in Philadelphia. 6 , Former hacker Kennedy also asserted that the most likely goal of this attack was to steal military secrets and technology and to surveil the U.S. government. ""However, a foreign adversary like Russia would also benefit from gaining access to America's financial system and the intellectual property of major corporations, so the damage could be vast,"" he said. ""We won't know the full damage from this breach for at least several months, and possibly years."" And while the scope of the aperture is yet to be determined, U.S. security officials are also scrambling to assess the damage. Vahid Behzadan, an assistant professor of engineering at the University of New Haven, noted that – based on the targeted organizations and agencies – ""the attack seems to be mainly an espionage operation, aiming to exfiltrate as much sensitive information and tools as possible."" ""Due to the expansive list of targets, it is difficult to say whether this was an attempt at mass data collection, or whether the attack targeted specific sources of information and masked this intent with secondary breaches,"" he continued. The National Security Council – also a SolarWinds user – on Monday conducted a second emergency meeting of its Cyber Response Group to discuss what happened and is reportedly summoning a subsidiary body. Several lawmakers have called for action to discern the breadth of the attacks and what resources agencies will now need to safeguard their networks.",3,2.1150825565250866,1.7193712449082996,0.39571131161678696,0

It’s only the fifth emergency directive issued by since 2015. U.S. The intrusion into the Treasury and Commerce department systems, first reported by Reuters, is believed to be connected to a breach at cybersecurity firm FireEye. The hackers may have infiltrated the systems by piggybacking on SolarWinds, a server software used by scores of government agencies and a majority of Fortune 500 companies. The directive warned that the “compromise of SolarWinds’ Orion Network Management Products poses unacceptable risks to the security of federal networks.” FireEye, according to the Associated Press, said its investigation into the hacking identified a “global campaign” that targeted governments and businesses in the private sector by inserting malware into SolarWinds updates beginning last spring. The malware gave the hackers remote access to the compromised computer networks for months. FireEye said it confirmed intrusions in North America, Europe, Asia and the Middle East. '' SolarWinds said there was a “potential vulnerability” related to its updates between March and June for software products called Orion and is working with the , FireEye and the intelligence community, the reported. “We believe that this vulnerability is the result of a highly sophisticated, targeted and manual supply chain attack by a nation state,” SolarWinds Kevin Thompson said in a statement. The is investigating whether a group connected to the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service, , is behind the attacks, The Washington Post reported. The cyberespionage group, known as 29 and Cozy Bear, was behind the hacking of the State Department and White House in 2014 and the Democratic National Committee during the 2016 presidential election. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov denied that Russia was involved. “Once again, I can reject these accusations,” Peskov told reporters. “If for many months the Americans couldn’t do anything about it, then, probably, one shouldn’t unfoundedly blame the Russians for everything.”",3,2.4051636903269493,2.2978166669462317,0.10734702338071767,0

The bill -- introduced by Sens. Susan Collins, R-Maine, and Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H. -- endeavors to ""provide the Director and the Secretary of State additional authority to compensate their personnel who incur brain injuries in connection with war or a hostile act."" It ultimately purports to mend a gap in the Federal Employees Compensation Act, which aids federal employees who suffer ""the loss or loss of use of a part of the body,"" yet that does not currently include bodily parts such as the brain and the heart.

One U.S. government count put the number of American personnel affected at 26. , For more than four years, dozens of American diplomats and intelligence personnel stationed in Cuba, Russia, China, and even on U.S. soil have reported a range of odd symptoms – from fatigue and headaches to impaired hearing, dizziness and memory loss – with no known origin or cause. Those impacted – including former officer Marc Polymeropoulos, who was forced into retirement given his persistent headaches, tinnitus, and loss of long-distance vision after being targeted while in a Moscow hotel in late 2017 – welcomed the support from both sides of the aisle. However, Polymeropoulos stressed there is much more that needs to happen. ""The bipartisanship nature of the bill is exactly what is needed on this issue, although more needs to be done as well,"" he told Fox News on Wednesday. ""I would also like to see hearings in both the intelligence and foreign affairs committees of both the House and Senate, both to address the medical needs of affected officials and to determine what is being done to stop future attacks.""

For more than four years, dozens of American diplomats and intelligence personnel stationed in Cuba, Russia, China, and even on U.S. soil have reported a range of odd ailments – from fatigue and headaches to impaired hearing, dizziness and memory loss – with no known origin or cause. But according to a government-commissioned report released by the National Academies of Sciences over the weekend, the illness, dubbed ""Havana Syndrome,"" is ""most likely"" the result of direct microwave radiation. The working theory, established by a committee of 19 experts in medical and related fields, pinpointed ""directed, pulsed radio frequency energy"" as ""the most plausible mechanism"" to have triggered the wave of maladies. While the report did not attribute blame or state that the likely attacks were the work of malicious intent, it said the sicknesses stem from ""pulsed"" and ""directed"" frequencies, seemingly emanating from a specific area in the room in a well-honed direction. This indicates that the exposure was not ""continuous"" or induced by a secondary culprit, such as a microwave or mobile phone. , Marc Polymeropoulos, a retired operative, told Fox News on Monday that he was a victim of one of these attacks while in a hotel room in Russia in 2017. Since the episode, Polymeropoulos said he has been suffering from debilitating migraines for the last three years and the constant sense of something being very wrong. ""I have a terrible headache that never goes away, the loss of long-distance vision, tinnitus – ringing in the ears,"" he said. Polymeropoulos assumes he was probably targeted in Moscow because he was one of the officers in charge of overseeing America’s efforts against the Russian government. As for the findings from the report – which only examined those impacted in Cuba and not across the globe – Polymeropoulos said it was a welcome relief after his symptoms were dismissed by senior medical agency personnel. “A renowned group of scientists telling us we weren’t making this up, that this wasn’t psychosomatic, I can imagine others a sense of relief,” he said. The Academies' analysis did not attribute blame to any foreign power. Still, it did illuminate the decades-long use of the tactic and radio frequency research specifically by Russia – giving more credence to long-held speculation of Moscow being behind the likely sonic attacks. John Hardie, a Russian foreign policy specialist at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies , explained that during the Cold War, the Soviet intelligence services ""used methods that endangered the health and well-being of American diplomats and intelligence officers, such as beaming concentrated electronic pulses and microwaves to eavesdrop on the U.S. Embassy in Moscow – carcinogenic 'spy dust' used to track U.S. intelligence officers."" Nick Dowling, a defense fellow at the National Defense University as well as a two-time policy adviser for presidential campaigns, concurred that ""Russia is one of the most advanced technological adversaries in the world and is more than capable of developing a sonic weapon."" ""Russia has been the leader in using new technologies to attack targets in covert and confusing ways. Russia is an active leader in what strategists are calling the gray zone of warfare – attacks in the gray zone between war and peace,"" he said. ""Attacking U.S. diplomats in Cuba and China are likely experimentation with this weapon but also serves the political interests of antagonizing U.S. relations with Cuba and China and creates fear, disruption and distraction among U.S. diplomats and officials."" And although the bizarre symptoms first surfaced in Cuba around 2016, U.S. investigations at that time found no evidence that the Havana government was behind any targeted assaults of U.S. – and later Canadian – personnel. However, since relations were restored in the aftermath of the Soviet Union's collapse, there has been a longstanding rule that Russian and U.S. intelligence services do not physically harm each other's officers – if it can be avoided. "" generally the idea is just to break the rules of the game, which normally say rival intel services don't cause physical harm,"" said Matthew Schmidt, an associate professor of national security at the University of New Haven. ""This kind of thing meets the letter of that, it doesn't technically get physical, but it breaks the norm of behavior because it seems to cause pretty severe harm. That destabilizes the game. People are worried, people don't perform as well because they're sick, or they're worried about being hurt and taking precautions against it, which may make them less effective."" - In this April 17, 2018 file photo, a man walks beside Canada's embassy in Havana, Cuba. Canada announced Wednesday, Jan. 30, 2019, it is removing up to half of the Canadians at its embassy in Cuba after another diplomat was found to have fallen mysteriously ill. Canada has confirmed 14 cases of mysterious health problems since early 2017. The Russian Embassy told Fox News that the ""insinuation of Moscow's involvement is ""absolutely absurd and bizarre"" – but experts are quick to point to a sobering history. : Complicating the U.S. government probe is the vast array of differing prognostics and experiences.

Some endure a kind of tremoring or a wind-like pressure; some hear nothing at all. While generally not deemed life-threatening but certainly damaging and injurious, the alleged attacks would be borne out of a desire to drive a wedge between the U.S. and other countries and ""mark up the cost"" for a diplomat and their family serving American interests. Nonetheless, the report – which was sent to the U.S. State Department in August for review and has since been the subject of criticism for not being released sooner – recommends that the U.S. government put protocols in place to immediately open a probe should such incidents occur. Furthermore, several former and current government officials are pushing for further action to get to the root of what has happened – and could still be happening. It remains unclear just how many Americans have been impacted. However, around 60 are said to have been treated by experts at the Center for Brain Injury and Repair at the University of Pennsylvania.

Polymeropoulos agreed that this needs to be a bipartisan issue, and understanding who is culpable is a pivotal mystery that intelligence agencies will need to solve. However, he stressed that in the meantime, there should also be a bipartisan push to ensure that victims – people who serve the United States in diplomatic and intel capacities as well as their families – receive immediate medical help for their injuries.

Last week, the U.S. Treasury Department sanctioned a Russian government research institution linked to the Triton malware, which the Treasury called “the most dangerous threat activity publicly known.” The hackers, by weaponizing Triton, aim to disable industrial safety systems. “Such systems provide for the safe emergency shutdown of industrial processes at critical infrastructure facilities in order to protect human life,” the Treasury said in the statement. , , “This is … the first time an [Industrial Control Systems] cyberattack has ever been sanctioned,” Rob Lee, and co-founder of industrial cybersecurity platform provider Dragos, told Fox News. “This is entirely appropriate as this cyberattack was the first ever targeted explicitly towards human life. We are fortunate no one died and I'm glad to see governments take a strong stance condemning such attacks,” Lee added. Prior to the Treasury issuing the statement, the and Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency issued an advisory on a Russian state-sponsored threat, saying that the entity “has conducted a campaign against a wide variety of U.S. targets.” The and said they observed the Russian state-sponsored actor targeting U.S. state, local, territorial and tribal government networks, as well as aviation networks. said the “threat actor” successfully compromised network infrastructure and “exfiltrated,” aka stole, data from at least two victim servers. These network vulnerabilities targeted “are a boon for … state-sponsored threat actors,” Satnam Narang, staff research engineer at Tenable, told Fox News. Russia has also been ramping up malicious cyber operations targeting the U.S. presidential election. John Ratcliffe, the director of National Intelligence, issued a statement last week that Russia – along with Iran – had obtained voter registration information. “This data can be used by foreign actors to attempt to communicate false information to registered voters that they hope will cause confusion, sow chaos, and undermine your confidence in American democracy,” Ratcliffe said. The meddling is not expected to stop any time soon, experts say. ""We can be sure that Russia will continue these nefarious tactics post-election, as expected reporting delays will provide the perfect opportunity for these operatives to spread false narratives on, for example, the legitimacy of the results in order to sow confusion and possible unrest among Americans,"" Theresa Payton, former White House chief information officer who served under President George W. Bush from 2006-2008 and of Fortalice Solutions, told Fox News. , “The Russian state is among the most successful operators of disinformation campaigns,” according to a report this week from cybersecurity firm Digital Shadows. “Russia’s attempts at broader political influence overseas have been facilitated by its use of state-owned traditional media, bots, ‘hack and leak’ operations, and cooperation between organized crime groups and Russian government agencies,” the report said.",3,2.312896527178523,2.792406046380869,-0.4795095192023462,7

Despite the warning from U.S. intelligence officials about Russian interference, O’Brien tried to assure Americans that the hackers can’t change voters or make it harder to cast a ballot. , , ; A '' ""No, they can't do either of those things,” he said. “And we got ahold of them early on because we've got great cyber folks, and we put a stop to it, but there's nothing they can do to change your vote or to stop you from voting."" The advisory from the and the Department of Homeland Security's cybersecurity agency described last Thursday an onslaught of recent activity by a Russian state-sponsored hacking group against a broad range of networks, some of which were successfully compromised. The alert released Thursday functions as a reminder of Russia's potent capabilities and ongoing interference in the election even as U.S. officials publicly called out Iran on Wednesday night. The advisory does not identify by name or location those who were targeted, but officials say they have no information that any election or government operations have been affected or that the integrity of elections data has been compromised. “However, the actor may be seeking access to obtain future disruption options, to influence U.S. policies and actions, or to delegitimize government entities,” the advisory said. O’Brien on Sunday pointed out that there is difference between the interference campaigns by Russians and Iranian attempts to sway people’s opinions. ""Your vote is secret. Every American should understand that their vote is secret,” he said. “And that was an Iranian effort to hurt the president.” U.S. officials have repeatedly said it would be extremely difficult for hackers to alter vote tallies in a meaningful way, but they have warned about other methods of interference that could disrupt the election, including cyberattacks on networks meant to impede the voting process. The interference could continue during or after the tallying of ballots if Russians produce spoofed websites or fake content meant to confuse voters about election results and lead them to doubt the legitimacy of the outcome. A broad concern, particularly at the local government level, has been that hackers could infiltrate a county network and then work their way over to election-related systems unless certain defenses, such as firewalls, are in place. This is especially true for smaller counties that don’t have as much money and support as their bigger counterparts to fund security upgrades. Despite Iran's activities, Russia is widely regarded in the cybersecurity community as the bigger threat to the election. The U.S. has said that Russia, which interfered in the 2016 election by hacking Democratic email accounts and through a covert social media effort, is interfering again this year in part through a concerted effort to denigrate Trump’s Democratic opponent, Joe Biden.",3,1.5551986457014289,2.995000186643881,-1.439801540942452,0

Four years ago, dozens of American officials stationed in Cuba started to hear odd cracks and humming in their ears – punctured by rushes of nausea, headaches, cloudy vision, memory loss, disequilibrium, and lethargy – all critical indicators of mild traumatic brain injury . The phenomenon was quickly dubbed the ""Havana syndrome."" And while similar symptoms have been documented by U.S. government employees in other places abroad, reports emerged this week suggesting that the potential sonic attacks might be far more pervasive than what was publicly known. In turn, more fingers are pointing toward Russia as being behind the global barrage of possible sonic attacks.

According to former high-ranking officer Marc Polymeropoulos, a late 2017 Moscow trip – amid the calamity of the Russian election interference findings put forth by the U.S. intelligence community – came to an unpleasant end when he was riddled with vomiting and vertigo that persisted long after he returned home, G.Q. reported. ' ,' ' ' His ailments oddly lined up with those disclosed not only a year earlier in the newly-rehabilitated U.S. Embassy in Havana, but what would also start to unravel in China in 2018.

Some said the onset of sickness also befell family members and began in late 2017. ""The safety and security of U.S. personnel, their families and U.S. citizens is our top priority,"" a statement from the U.S. State Department read at the time.

While the administration did also launch an investigation concerning the matter in Cuba, withdrew the majority of its staffers coupled with a travel advisory, framed the happenings as ""targeted attacks,"" and expelled 15 Cuban diplomats from Washington, no real evidence of Cuban wrongdoing ever surfaced. Moreover, no hardline findings were ever brought to bear on the strange occurrences and dull pings. Canadian officials have also since withdrawn 14 citizens from Havana, citing eerily akin neurological conditions. Yet the peculiarities continue to pile up with few definitive answers. Then in November last year, as per , an unnamed White House staffer was additionally targeted by a man who exited a parked van and passed the staffer as she walked her dog in Arlington, Va.

In a separate case months earlier, an unnamed American diplomat and his family purportedly heard similar mysterious sounds and fell ill while stationed in Philadelphia.

""This 'directional sound wave' focuses kinetic energy into a tight space. It is, therefore, an effective sound canon designed to disorientate and debilitate the hearer and disperse a crowd."" The anomalies have since surfaced in a slew of other countries ranging from Poland and Georgia to Taiwan and Australia, raising red flags over what covert weapons might be directed at U.S. personnel, and more scrutiny is turning to Moscow as a likely culprit. According to Wood, it is not yet evident that the attacks are related – but they are consistent with the employment of a sonic device. ""At both the civilian and military level, Russia has used such weapons against protesters and U.S. diplomats,"" he said. Hoffman also pointed out that such attacks, while generally not deemed life-threatening but certainly damaging and injurious, would be borne out of a desire to drive a wedge between the U.S. and other countries and ""mark up the cost"" for a diplomat and their family serving American interests.

However, since relations between the two rivals were restored in the aftermath of the Soviet Union's collapse, there has been a longstanding rule of conduct between the Russian and U.S. intelligence services that they do not do physical harm to one another's officers if it can be avoided. these reports seem to indicate a new and different practice,"" observed Matthew Rojansky, Director of the Kennan Institute at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars and adjunct lecturer at the Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies at Johns Hopkins University. ""This is not a brand new technology, but the weaponization of it in this particular way is fairly novel.

2020-07-29,Fox,https://www.foxnews.com/tech/space-force-russia-orbit-anti-satellites-testing,Space Force on alert: Behind Russia's mysterious testing of deadly anti-satellite weapons in orbit,"Space Wars: it might soon leave the realm of science fiction and become a reality. Last week, the head of the U.S.'s newest military branch, the Space Force, cautioned publicly for the first time that Moscow had undertaken at least two concerning anti-satellite weapon tests in recent months, in a potential bid to develop on-orbit efficiency that could dangerously hinder the U.S.'s heavy dependency on space-based systems. ""On July 15, Russia injected a new object into orbit from Cosmos 2543,"" the U.S. Space Force said in a statement. ""Russia released this object in proximity to another Russian satellite, inconsistent with the system's stated mission as an inspector satellite."" While Russia's Defense Ministry dismissed the allegation, it is not the first time the Pentagon has said such an incident occurred. Gen. John W. ""Jay"" Raymond, commander of U.S. Space Command and U.S. Space Force chief of space operations, further highlighted that the Russian satellite system used to conduct this on-orbit weapons test is the same onr they ""raised concerns about earlier this year when Russia maneuvered near a U.S. government satellite."" ' ' ? ""This is further evidence of Russia's continuing efforts to develop and test space-based systems, and consistent with the Kremlin's published military doctrine to employ weapons that hold the U.S. and allied space assets at risk,"" Raymond continued. The proclamation that these satellites are part of a space-based anti-satellite weapon system is even more significant given that Cosmos 2542 had moved into a position to shadow a U.S. -11 spy satellite, publicly identified only as 245, in January, The Drive's War Zone analysis pointed out. : Gen. John ""Jay"" Raymond, the commander of Air Force Space Command and the Joint Force Space Component Command. A month earlier, the 245 satellite was forced to move its own orbit to avoid a collision with the notorious 2543, which the U.S. Space Force believes was also trailing the American asset. Then in April this year, Space Force also raised red flags that the Kremlin had conducted testing of an unspecified ""direct-ascent anti-satellite missile,"" also known as a -, from its Plesetsk base in northern Russia. ""Russia's - test provides yet another example that the threats to the U.S. and allied space systems are real, serious and growing,"" Raymond said in a statement after that incident. ""The United States is ready and committed to deterring aggression and defending the nation, our allies and U.S. interests from hostile acts in space."" While no targets were destroyed in either the April or July experiments, the pattern – coupled with the notion of two Russian satellites following an American spy satellite – is enough to stir up some anxieties. ""If we stick to the U.S. version, the Russians now have a means for using small satellites to intercept a target in orbit and destroy it,"" Miguel Miranda, an Asia-based arms and security expert, told Fox News. ""This is a serious capability because the U.S. military's biggest advantage over its rivals is an immense command and control plus intelligence and surveillance network orbiting our planet. Without it, the U.S. military suffers and struggles to fulfill its mission."" Moreover, the U.S. State Department underscored that matter both in 2018 and again in 2020, saying that ""Russian satellite behaviors were inconsistent with their stated mission and that these satellites displayed characteristics of a space-based weapon,"" and characterizing the behavior as ""hypocritical and concerning."" Eugene Gholz, an associate professor of political science at the University of Notre Dame, also emphasized that – if accurate – it is no small matter. ""The capability to weaken U.S. military satellite constellations would inhibit the U.S. military's ability to project power far from the U.S. homeland — that is, space is an essential part of the U.S. military's infrastructure for operations against countries like Russia, China and Iran. The United States uses space-based intelligence gathering to understand threats to the U.S. homeland , but the U.S. also uses a lot of space-based capability to enable the U.S. military to go attack other countries,"" he explained. ""Relatively powerful other countries like Russia are naturally interested in weakening the U.S. military's ability to attack them, which naturally attracts those countries to finding ways to hamper U.S. military space operations."" The logo for the newly-created Space Force. But what is the newly-deployed and seemingly troublesome Cosmos 2543, also spelled Kosmos 2543? Moscow deems it a ""space apparatus inspector,"" which does nothing more than observe and examine damage to other equipment on-orbit. Yet given its small stature and mobility, some defense experts suspect it could also double as spycraft or be used to destroy other critical space apparatuses in a number of ways – including launching projectiles, which the U.S. Space Force is accusing its Russian counterparts of dry-running in recent months. ""Details remain vague on this 'inspector satellite,' but the main concern is it's able to launch small payloads toward another orbiting vehicle,"" Miranda said. ""Going by that alone, it does seem to have an offensive role, and this is what the U.S. military is concerned about."" Dean Cheng, a senior research fellow and space expert at The Heritage Foundation, concurred that a big part of the problem quite simply is that we don't entirely know what the Cosmos 2543 is and what it can do. ""It would appear to be a mini-satellite, launched from Cosmos 2542. Now, Cosmos 2543 has itself launched a smaller object,"" he noted. ""I am not aware of the U.S. testing anything akin to this. The U.S. and other states have talked about 'servicing satellites,' usually more in terms of systems that would be able to refuel and possibly repair satellites in orbit."" According to the U.S. Space Force statement, Russia's development and testing of orbital weapons highlight the importance of instituting the U.S. Space Force as a new branch of the armed forces – signed last year as an executive order by President Trump – and the U.S. Space Command as the nation's unified combatant command for space. ""It is a shared interest and responsibility of all spacefaring nations to create the conditions for a safe, stable and operationally sustainable space environment,"" the release continued. '' ' ' But what that means in practice remains to be seen, as the two powers have different objectives when it comes to developing a protocol. ""Both sides are gearing up for a future where the killing of satellites would be a key capability in a war or conflict. The goal is simple: if your opponent is blinded, he can't attack you. Having weapons that can kill satellites that would direct precision attacks, find potential threats, and even wage a nuclear war are clearly a game-changer,"" observed Harry Kazianis, a senior director at the Center for the National Interest. ""They also create the potential for a weapon that could create incentives to strike satellites first in a war, as whoever does so and does so fast has a good chance at coming out as the winner."" Washington and Moscow are holding their first discussions on space militarization in Vienna this week. The Wall Street Journal said Trump administration officials hoped the meeting ""would lead to the establishment of a set of voluntary norms for operating in space and possibly a new communications channel to link space officials on each side,"" while Russia in contrast ""has advocated a formal treaty against the placement of weapons in space, reflecting Moscow's long-standing push to head off a potential U.S. effort to develop space-based antimissile defenses,"" making it unclear if an agreement will be reached. ""There is clearly ongoing tension between the U.S. and Russia, in space but also on the ground. The Russian annexation of Crimea, its support for 'little green men' in eastern Ukraine, its pressure on Georgia and the Baltic states, all indicate that its relations with the West will remain tense for the foreseeable future,"" Cheng said. ""Space reflects terrestrial tensions, and it is likely that there will be further tests of new Russian weapons, as they would want to neutralize the American space advantage in any conflict.""

In addition to simmering space tensions with Russia, the U.S. Space Force also has to contend with China's influence in the sphere as it is also actively curating an array on anti-satellite systems. In 2007, Beijing sent a message to its adversaries by shooting a kinetic anti-satellite missile to blow up a weather satellite, demonstrating its prowess and generating the worst scattering of debris in the Space Age so far. Experts warn that the aerospace warfare arena – while still in its infancy – could quickly emerge as the prominent battlefield for a substantial conflict in the not-so-distant future. Its domain is especially crucial for the United States, which depends upon space systems for everything from navigation and weapons guidance to intelligence collection, communications, data sharing and storage, and advanced attack warnings.",3,3.628299038248686,4.263806765076434,-0.6355077268277478,6

The U.S. announced plans Wednesday to shift 12,000 troops out of Germany as part of a multibillion-dollar effort to deter Russian influence and reassure European allies in the region. The moves, which will bring 6,400 American troops home and shift 5,600 elsewhere on the continent, are set to begin “within weeks,” according to Defense Secretary Mark Esper. It also fulfills President Trump’s previously announced desire to withdraw troops from Germany, largely due to its failure to spend enough on defense. “These changes will achieve the core principles of enhancing U.S. and deterrence of Russia, strengthening , reassuring allies and improving U.S. strategic flexibility,” Esper said. Reaction from Johns Hopkins University's Wendy Osefu and American Conservative Union chair Matt Schlapp. A number of the forces will go to Italy, while the headquarters of the U.S. European Command and Special Operations Command Europe will be relocated from Stuttgart, Germany, to Belgium. Esper told reporters Wednesday that the movements – which will cost in the “single-digit” billions of dollars – will keep about 24,000 troops in Germany and shift other forces further east into the Black Sea and Baltic regions. Some of the troops returning stateside will later conduct rotational deployments “back to Europe,” he added. Germany is a hub for U.S. operations in the Middle East and Africa. The decision to keep nearly half of the 12,000 affected troops in Europe, the Associated Press says, is a clear move by the Pentagon to assuage allies by avoiding their complete withdrawal from the region. And by spreading forces into the east, it sends a message to Russia that the U.S. is not reducing its commitment to the region and remains ready to protect Eastern Europe from any Moscow aggression. Sen. Jim Inhofe, the Republican chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, has voiced support for the plan while also acknowledging it will take “months to plan and years to execute.” He was briefed on the issue last week, and he issued a statement saying the “concept for realigning U.S. military posture in Europe” is sound. In this 2011 file photo, the German and U.S. flags fly on a lamp post in front of the White House in Washington ahead of German Chancellor Angela Merkel's visit. Defense officials say the U.S. will pull 12,000 troops from Germany, bringing 6,400 forces home and shifting 5,600 to other countries in Europe, including Italy and Belgium. The plan will cost billions of dollars and take years to complete. ’S ‘’ But members of Trump’s own political party have criticized the troop move as a gift to Russia and a threat to U.S. national security. Twenty-two Republicans on the House Armed Services Committee recently wrote a letter to Trump saying a reduced U.S. commitment to Europe’s defense would encourage Russian aggression and opportunism. Trump announced last month that he wanted to cut the number of active-duty U.S. troops in Germany from roughly 36,000 to fewer than 25,000. Shifting forces out of the country had long been rumored and is in line with the Pentagon's efforts to put more troops in the Indo-Pacific. The president on Wednesday indicated the move was tied more directly to his anger over Germany’s failure to meet defense spending goals. “We’re reducing the force because they’re not paying their bills. It’s very simple. They’re delinquent,” the president told reporters outside the White House, adding that he might rethink the decision to pull troops out of Germany ""if they start paying their bills.” In this 2015 file photo, an airplane lands at the Air Base in Ramstein, Germany. Trump has branded Germany “delinquent” for failing to meet a goal set in 2014 for members to halt budget cuts and move toward spending at least 2 percent of their gross national product on defense by 2024. He asserted that the Germans had long shortchanged the United States on trade and defense, declaring that “until they pay” more for their own defense, he will reduce U.S. troops. Overall, the U.S. has about 47,000 troops and civilian personnel in Germany, spread out across a number of bases, headquarters and smaller installations. Most of the 36,000 on active duty are in a handful of larger Army and Air Force bases, including Ramstein Air Base, a hub in the region. There also are 2,600 National Guard and Reserve forces in Germany and almost 12,000 civilians working for the services or the Defense Department.

The 11-count indictment against Li Xiaoyu, 34, and Dong Jiazhi, 31, alleges the Chinese nationals hacked into the computer systems of hundreds of companies, government organizations as well as individual dissidents and clergy. They also allegedly broke into the accounts of democratic and human rights activists in the United States, Hong Kong and mainland China. The Justice Department alleges their con, which for a decade had allegedly been stealing sensitive information, was not only for personal financial gain but also to benefit the Chinese government. , ""The hackers stole terabytes of data from hundreds of targets establishing themselves as a prolific threat to U.S. and foreign networks,"" Assistant Attorney General for National Security John Demers said during a press conference in New York.

The industries included the high-tech manufacturing of medical devices, industrial engineering, business, educational and gaming software as well as in energy and pharmaceutical defense.

Ramzan Kadyrov, 43, has run Chechnya like his personal fiefdom, relying on his security forces to quash dissent. International human rights groups have accused Kadyrov and his lieutenants of abductions, torture and killings of their opponents. Rights defenders also hold the Chechen authorities responsible for a sweeping crackdown on gays over the past few years that has seen more than 100 people arrested, subjected to torture, with some of them killed. Chechen authorities have denied those accusations, and federal authorities said a probe found nothing to support the charges. Chechnya's regional leader Ramzan Kadyrov speaks during a meeting in Grozny, Russia, in 2019. '-' In a statement announcing the sanctions, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo pointed at “extensive credible information that Kadyrov is responsible for numerous gross violations of human rights dating back more than a decade, including torture and extrajudicial killings.” Pompeo said the restrictions will apply to Kadyrov’s wife and two daughters and he encouraged U.S. allies to take similar measures. Kadyrov responded on his blog, posting a picture of himself standing in a weapons storage room with a smile on his face and a machine gun in each hand. - Steve Harrigan reports from Miami “Pompeo, we accept the fight. It’s going to be even more fun down the road,” he said. Russian lawmakers said that Moscow will find a way to reciprocate to the U.S. sanctions against Kadyrov, but wouldn’t say what a possible response could be.

Russian cyber hackers are targeting organizations involved in coronavirus vaccine development, security officials in the U.S., United Kingdom and Canada claimed Thursday. The British National Cyber Security Centre published an advisory detailing the activity of the threat group known as 29, which “has exploited organizations globally.” The assessed that 29, also named “the Dukes” or “Cozy Bear,” almost certainly operate as part of Russian Intelligence Services. The assessment is supported by partners at the Canadian Communication Security Establishment , the U.S. Department of Homeland Security , the Cybersecurity Infrastructure Security Agency and the National Security Agency . : , “It is completely unacceptable that the Russian Intelligence Services are targeting those working to combat the coronavirus pandemic,'' U.K.'s Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said in a statement. “While others pursue their selfish interests with reckless behavior, the U.K. and its allies are getting on with the hard work of finding a vaccine and protecting global health.'' The made the announcement in a press release, where it claimed “29’s campaign of malicious activity is ongoing, predominantly against government, diplomatic, think-tank, health care and energy targets to steal valuable intellectual property.” “We condemn these despicable attacks against those doing vital work to combat the coronavirus pandemic,” Paul Chichester, 's director of operations, said in a statement. “Working with our allies, the is committed to protecting our most critical assets and our top priority at this time is to protect the health sector."" Chichester also urged ""organizations to familiarize themselves with the advice we have published to help defend their networks.” - : The said they are more than 95 percent certain that 29 is part of the Russian Intelligence Services. It also assessed it is highly likely – between 80 and 90 percent – that this activity was to collect information on -19 vaccine research or research into the -19 virus itself. Is it realistic to expect a vaccine by the end of 2020? Fox News medical contributor Dr. Janette Nesheiwat weighs in. The persistent and ongoing attacks are seen by intelligence officials as an effort to steal intellectual property, rather than to disrupt research. It was unclear whether any information actually was stolen but the British center says individuals’ confidential information is not believed to have been compromised. Cozy Bear, also known as ""the Dukes,"" has been identified by Washington as one of two Russian government-linked hacking groups that broke into the Democratic National Committee computer network and stole emails ahead of the 2016 presidential election. The other group is usually called Fancy Bear.

It said known targets of 29 include British, American and Canadian vaccine research and development organizations. Officials claim the group uses a variety of tools and techniques, including spear-phishing and custom malware known as “WellMess” and “WellMail.” The statement did not say whether Russian President Vladimir Putin knew about the vaccine research hacking, but British officials believe such intelligence would be highly prized.

The operations came after President Trump gave the “sweeping authorization” in 2018 by signing a ""presidential finding,"" according to Yahoo News, citing U.S. officials with knowledge of the matter. With a presidential finding, the president authorizes covert action necessary to support “identifiable foreign policy objectives"" that are deemed ""important to the national security of the United States,” according to a U.S. government document. 15 The authorization undoes “many restrictions that had been in place under prior administrations,” and gives the more leeway in authorizing its own covert cyber operations, the Yahoo News report said. Countries mentioned as possible targets include Russia, China, Iran and North Korea. “The White House wanted a vehicle to strike back. And this was the way to do it,” the report added, quoting a former U.S. government official. The new powers gave the more latitude to “damage adversaries’ critical infrastructure, such as petrochemical plants, and to engage in the kind of hack-and-dump operations that Russian hackers and WikiLeaks popularized,” the report explained. The hack-and-dump tactic involves leaking stolen documents or data to journalists or posting it on the Internet. Initially, the Obama administration considered retaliating against Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election by using hack-and-dump but, in the end, the was told to “stand down,” the report stated. John Bolton’s appointment as the National Security Adviser in the Trump administration changed that, Yahoo News reported, citing a passage in Bolton’s memoir, “The Room Where It Happened.” , 5 -19 In September 2018, the White House announced a new national cybersecurity strategy to bolster the government’s defenses against foreign adversaries. While cyber-defense was central to the strategy, Bolton also called for a better offense. “We’re going to do a lot of things offensively and I think our adversaries need to know that,” John Bolton told reporters at the time, according to Cyberscoop. “We will identify, counter, disrupt, degrade, and deter behavior in cyberspace that is destabilizing and contrary to national interests, while preserving the United States’ overmatch in and through cyberspace,” Bolton added.

2020-07-10,Fox,https://www.foxnews.com/world/russia-us-nuclear-arms-agreement-undiplomatic,"Russia calls US’s newest stance on nuclear arms agreement 'undiplomatic,' considers not extending","Experts say satellite images show a previously undeclared site that appears to be assembling and storing nuclear warheads; senior foreign affairs correspondent Greg Palkot reports. A top Russian diplomat said Friday that he is not optimistic that the U.S.-Russian nuclear arms agreement will be extended because of Washington’s demands to include China in the proposal. Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov cautioned the Trump administration that Russia will continue to protect its security defenses, with or without the New treaty, noting they are likely unwilling to accept Washington’s new demands. The New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty was signed in 2010 by former President Barack Obama and then Russian President Dmitry Medvedev. The agreement, made in accordance with the 1987 Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces Treaty, limited the number of deployed nuclear warheads to no more than 1,550 along with 700 missiles and bombers. , 'S ' ' Both the U.S. and Russia pulled out of the original 1987 nuclear arms agreement last year, leaving the New treaty as the last line of defense against nuclear proliferation between the world’s leading nations in nuclear development. If the treaty expired it would be the first time the U.S. and Russia were not united in a nuclear arms treaty since the Cold War. “We only need the extension as much as the Americans do,” Lavrov said during a conference call with foreign policy experts Friday. “If they categorically refuse, we will not try to persuade them.” Russia has said they would extend the treaty, which is set to expire Feb. 2021, without any additional provisions. But the Trump administration is now pushing for a new agreement that would include China. Russia security officials are claiming this new agreement is unrealistic, and point to China’s repeated refusals to negotiate an arms deal that requires they reduce their number of nuclear arms. The U.S. and Russia account for more than 90 percent of the world’s nuclear arms, according to Defense News. China has said they are committed to a no first-use policy -- a nuclear deterance strategy that means China won’t strike first. However, China is working to increase its nuclear forces and has reportedly expanded its response capabilities, as reported by Defense News. Lavrov rejected the U.S.’s calls to have Russia negotiate with China on reducing its nuclear arms arsenal, calling it “undiplomatic”. He said that they would be happy to discuss nuclear arms reductions with any country whether it’s Britain, France or China but said it needs to be that country’s decision. “I’m not particularly optimistic about the New in view of the course taken by U.S. negotiators,” Lavrov said. Lavrov said that the administration’s new stance on nuclear arms is making it more unlikely an agreement can be reached, adding “we are absolutely confident that we can guarantee our security for a long perspective, even in the absence of this treaty.” The U.S’s new contingency comes amid increasingly strained tensions between the U.S. and China – Lavrov note that the feud could hurt the global economy. But when asked if Russia could assist in brokering their relationship Lavrov said “If they ask us, if they show such interest, we won’t refuse to do so.” “We’ve established contact with both parties,” Lavrov said. “We are always ready to try to help, but, of course, we won’t push our services on anyone.” Russia is now debating pulling out of the Open Skies Treaty, which allows for observation flights over military facilities, after Trump announced in May the U.S. may be pulling out of the 2002 agreement. “We will make a final decision on whether to stay in it after we weigh all the consequences of the U.S. withdrawal,” Lavrov said. The European Union has urged the U.S. to reconsider. The Department of State could not be reached to answer whether or not the U.S. would allow the nuclear arms treaty with Russia to expire if China refuses to sign the new agreement.

2020-07-02,Fox,https://www.foxnews.com/world/russian-military-intelligence-unit-insurgents-kill-americans-afghanistan,Behind the top-secret Russian military intelligence unit accused of paying insurgents to kill Americans in Afghanistan,"Some call it ""Putin's assassination squad."" Some say, ""Russian killing squad."" In any case, there is a Russian clandestine military intelligence unit known as the 29155, and it is believed to behind a string of scandals – most recently, a reported scheme to pay bounties to Afghan insurgents to kill U.S. troops. So what exactly is the shadowy assemblage? ""There's no real U.S. analog. It's like a mix of and special forces,"" Matthew Schmidt, associate professor of national security at the University of New Haven, told Fox News. ""It's trained to make mayhem. The overall goal is to destabilize targeted political systems, including in Europe, to attack the political will to maintain , with other missions as opportunity allows, including the killing of traitors."" Ultimately, experts and analysts define it as something of an elite squad tasked with sabotage and targeted assassinations. In this June 16, 2018 file photo, Taliban fighters gather with residents to celebrate a three-day cease fire marking the Islamic holiday of Eid al-Fitr, in Nangarhar province, east of Kabul, Afghanistan. Unit 29155 operates under Russia's umbrella intelligence agency the , officially termed the Main Directorate of the General Staff, which formed after the folding of the Soviet-era . This specialized outfit is believed to have been birthed around 2008, two years after Russian President Putin legalized targeted killings on foreign soil and in the aftermath of Russia's invasion of Georgia that same year. ' ' While it is unclear exactly how many operatives make up the unit, reports indicate that some involved have decades of experiences beneath their belt – dating back to the ultimately failed Soviet incursion into Afghanistan in the 1980s. While it is unclear exactly when in recent years 29155 came onto the radar of Western intelligence, the Russian Defense Ministry is said to have lavished bonuses and praise on the team in 2012, and the Unit commander Maj. Gen Andrei Vladimirovich Averyanov – a veteran of the Chechen wars, starting in 1994 and 1999 respectively – was awarded the esteemed Hero of Russia medal in 2015, according to Business Insider. It is also suspected that 29155 played a pivotal part in Russia's 2014 takeover of Ukraine's Crimea region, both through propaganda and media efforts and in the notion of ""little green men"" – as described to Fox News by locals – that mysteriously popped up in the peninsula ahead of the highly controversial annexation. In this file photo taken on Wednesday, June 24, 2020, Russian President Vladimir Putin, center, watches the Victory Day military parade marking the 75th anniversary of the Nazi defeat in Moscow. Russian authorities seem to be pulling out all the stops to get people to vote on a series of constitutional amendments that would enable President Vladimir Putin to stay in office until 2036 by resetting the clock on his term limits. However, 29155 has spread its wings well beyond Eastern Europe in recent times. The division is alleged to have been behind two 2015 attempts to assassinate Emilian Gebrev, a Bulgarian arms manufacturer, through poisoning. The following year, the unit was implicated for having likely orchestrated a botched coup in Montenegro, which entailed taking out Prime Minister Milo Djukanovic. And in 2018, U.K. officials pointed fingers at unit members as having carried out an assassination pursuit – using a nerve agent – on defected Russian spy Sergei V. Skirpal. In 2019, French officials reportedly unearthed a clandestine base in the Alps, used to execute regional missions, on the heels of media reports that the Unit was videoed giving a retired military leader a wad of cash in Serbia. Spanish officials have also blamed the 29155 of rousing the Catalan independence push, which started in 2010 and gained momentum following a referendum in November 2014. German leaders are also wary of foul play by the group on their soil – and subsequently expelled two Russian diplomats late last year over the audacious murder of a Georgian man in Berlin. The unit is assumed to sometimes operate under diplomatic cover abroad. But in regards to Afghanistan, U.S. intelligence is still trying to piece together the extent to which the assumed bounty operations were conducted. But according to multiple defense sources who spoke to Fox News on the condition of anonymity, there is some skepticism and questions as to whether it is being blown out of proportion. ""It's being portrayed that the Russians paid the Taliban to hit coalition forces, especially Americans. But whenever you have an operation using proxies, money is going to be involved,"" said one insider. ""And it definitely shows that there are people in the intelligence community that are willing to leak information even if it is unverified. Clearly, that was done for political purposes."" U.S. troops patrol at an Afghan National Army Base in Logar province, Afghanistan August 7, 2018. /Omar Sobhani - 1D8EB3A110 A former Afghan military official also told Fox News that mercenary-type activities are nothing unprecedented into the bloodied nation, although this unit in-particular has ostensibly gone under the radar for some time. Indeed, Russian meddling in U.S. interests inside the country is also hardly new, with evidence surfacing in 2017 that Moscow was arming the Taliban. The Kremlin has openly advocated its support of any group fighting – which the Taliban has done – but denied any weapons transfers. The Trump administration has mostly rebuffed the story as not being credible, with national security advisor Robert O'Brien telling Fox News on Wednesday that ""the president's career briefer decided not to brief him because it was unverified intelligence."" So what is Putin's play in Russia all about? ""The goal is simple: They want us out of Afghanistan. They want us out of their backyard,"" noted one U.S. defense source. ""The same way we would view the situation if Russia suddenly brought troops to Mexico. Afghanistan is mineral-rich and has an incredible amount of precious metals; it has always been Russia's policy to [dominate] that."" According to the New York Times, an individual by the name of Rahmatullah Azizi – a businessman who wants to take advantage of the U.S. contractor cash flow into the beleaguered nation – was the ""middle man"" figure behind alleged efforts to launder money from Russia into Afghanistan to pay off militants, and presumably fled to Russia before the funds were located in one of his properties. It also remains to be seen what – if any – impact accusations of Taliban taking Moscow money might have on their peace deal with the United States, which was signed in February following months of negotiations and paves the way for a withdrawal of U.S. troops after almost 19 years of stalemate war. ""This administration is set on a deal in order to get American troops out,"" Schmidt added. ""Because the cost in lives wasn't worth it.""",3,3.4722034018505856,2.2506973217903727,1.2215060800602129,26

Officials deplored the violence and the country's health minister pledged to share evacuees' quarantine for two weeks in a bid to reassure protesters who fear they'll be infected.
