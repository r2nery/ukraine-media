Moscow and Tehran have reached a deal to make drones on Russian soil to bolster its war effort in Ukraine following months of relentless bombings on civilian locations, a report by the Washington Post said Saturday. Fox News could not immediately reach the Pentagon for comment, but according to the report, U.S. intelligence officials recently learned of the agreement which was reached by the two nations in early November. The U.S. first revealed Iranian plans to ""gift"" Russia hundreds of Shahed-136 drones earlier this year and by August 1,000 Iranian-supplied drones were shipped off to Russia before being dropped over civilian targets in Ukraine. - Firefighters work after a drone attack on buildings in Kyiv, Ukraine, Oct. 17, 2022. 18 , 5 , The agreement apparently coincided with Russia’s defeat in Kherson earlier this month when it withdrew its forces from the capital city in its biggest military loss since retreating from Kharkiv in September. It is unclear which drone design would be employed for production in Russia, but according to the report officials from both nations are working the transfer key components and plans to get the manufacturing up and running within three months. A reported 400 drones have been dropped over various targets in Ukraine, hitting civilian neighborhoods, villages, cities and the nation’s energy infrastructure. Russia has intensified its aerial attacks in recent months while its ground forces continue to see setbacks as Ukrainian forces push the front lines farther east. A drone is launched during a military exercise in an undisclosed location in Iran, in this handout image obtained on Aug. 25, 2022. ' ' Since Nov. 11, Russia had launched roughly 150 missiles and over 25 kamikaze drones against Ukraine, according to Ukrainian General Staff Deputy Chief Oleksii Hromov on Thursday. Over 100 of the air strikes carried out in the six-day period were blocked by Ukraine’s air defenses. But Russia’s latest agreement with Tehran may not only increase its ability to produce more drones but may rapidly increase the amount of time it would take to refit its troops both in Ukraine and those in border regions in Russia and Belarus.

Ukraine has pleaded with its Western allies since the beginning of the war to help it improve its air defenses – a request that has become ever more urgent given Russia’s heavy reliance on aerial attacks. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin said this week that he, and the nearly 50 other allied nations that make up the Ukraine Contact Group, were looking to send Ukraine the ""right mix"" of air defenses and weaponry to stop Russia from gaining air superiority. The news that Moscow will increase its drone production also comes just three days after a Ukrainian air defense system crashed across borders and killed two in Poland after Russia levied missiles at Western Ukraine.",49,0.0,0.0,0.0,9

Russia’s war in Ukraine has been defined by tragedy, brutality and a battle of wills, but no campaign in Ukraine has shown this more than the seven-month-long fight for Kharkiv, one commander told Fox News. ""If people want to understand this war fully,"" Commander of the 127th Brigade of the Territorial Defense Forces of Kharkiv Roman Hryshchenko said speaking from a post in Kharkiv, ""there is no war between Ukraine and Russia.""

""When we talk about the 127th Brigade, it should be understood that before the full-scale invasion, almost all of them had never held a weapon in their hands,"" he said in an interview translated by the Ukraine Frontline Media Platform. Hryshchenko, who is called ""Uncle Roma"" by his troops, explained that the 127th Brigade was established as a volunteer force following Russia’s invasion, with just 30% of its troops having had previous soldiering experience in eastern Ukraine. ""The rest are entirely civilian people,"" he said of the roughly 5,000 strong fighting force. ""More than 70% [had] never held a weapon in their hands but who came to defend their land."" Ukrainian forces are seen in Izium after Russian forces withdraw from the Izium City, Kharkiv Oblast, Ukraine on Sept. 16, 2022. Moscow was never able to fully occupy Kharkiv despite its best efforts – a defeat made even more impressive by the fact that the Ukrainian region shares a border with Russia. However, its proximity to Russia meant the brigade would see some of the most consistently brutal warfare, not only in Ukraine, but in Europe since World War . By Feb. 26, two days after Moscow’s ""special military operation"" began, senior U.S. defense officials assessed that the ""heaviest fighting"" was occurring in and around Kharkiv. 18 , 5 , Two days later, Human Rights Watch found that Russian forces were already using banned weaponry by deploying cluster munitions on civilian targets. However, the brutality Kharkiv saw in the early days of the war was just the beginning, in what would become a seemingly David vs Goliath battle front.

Mechanics are repairing captured Russian tanks that were damaged in battle, so that they can be used by the Ukrainian military against their enemy. It would be another three months before the region saw some reprieve, as fighting stalled after the brigade successfully launched a counter-offensive and pushed Russian troops back across their national lines. The British defense ministry chalked it up to Russia's ""inability"" to understand the level of resistance it would receive from civilian populations across Ukraine. ""You know Kharkiv very poorly,"" Hryshchenko said in explanation as to why the region proved so difficult for the invading forces to take, despite its proximity to Russia. ""Our people are made of iron and concrete."" ""The enemy is not fighting our army, it is fighting the civilian population,"" he added.

The successful campaign carried out by the civilian-turned soldier brigade would be not only critical for Kharkiv, but vital for security assurances across Ukraine, Fox News was told.

2022-11-13,Fox,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/what-putin-thinking-russia-ukraine-war-nine-months-after-invasion,What is Putin thinking? Where the Russia-Ukraine war stands nine months after invasion,"Former U.S. intel officer Rebekah Koffler reacts to the Russian government's failure to inform the Biden White House of Brittney Griner’s transfer to a penal colony last week on 'Fox News Live.' Washington will soon debate sending billions more to Ukraine to assist its war effort. Lawmakers may want to first conduct a reality check on where Russia stands in this nine-month war and on Putin’s decision calculus. This suggests that U.S. funding will not produce quick results, may not produce any results or may also produce very bad results for America and Ukraine. This is how, when wishful thinking is set aside, things actually look: The Battlefield Multiple areas across Ukraine are still under Russian assault, even as Ukrainian forces are gaining momentum with an effective counter-offensive, pushing to reclaim territories captured by Russia. On Friday, special units of Ukraine’s armed forces entered the strategic city of Kherson in southern Ukraine, following the retreat of the Russian troops as directed by the Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu. As Ukraine’s president Zelenskyy was championing another victory, the Kremlin warned that Kherson’s status didn’t change, despite the retreat, claiming that the city was still ‘part of Russia.’ The Russians are unlikely to permanently abandon Kherson or any of the three regions that Moscow recently ""annexed."" The Russian ground forces who assumed defensive positions on the left bank of the Dniepr River, will probably not engage in a mano-a-mano battle with Ukrainians, having lost so many men and so much military hardware. The withdrawal is a potential ruse to lure Ukrainian troops into a radioactive chamber. Russian Spetsnaz operatives reportedly left a nasty message on a door of one of the buildings. Addressed to Ukrainians, the message warned that this was ""the territory of the Russian Empire,"" that Putin was ""our and your Czar"" and that the Russian troops went ""on vacation."" Vladimir Putin and his Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu stand together during a Navy Day Parade in Saint Petersburg, Russia in July. ’S 'S For weeks, Moscow has been accusing Kyiv of planning to use a ""dirty bomb,"" also called a radiological dispersal device , an improvised nuclear device containing dynamite laced with radioactive powder. Unlike traditional nuclear bombs, s have low military value but produce panic and terror in the opposing force and population. They cause severe burns, irradiation sickness, and they contaminate food and water. Driving Ukrainians out of the region by contamination would be consistent with Russia’s most recent military doctrine, which envisions use of radiological, chemical and biological warfare for ""defensive"" purposes. The Russians have a special military branch, Radiological, Chemical and Biological Defense Forces , that are trained in decontamination and clean up. A New Strategy of Indirect Action Russia has all but exhausted its conventional combat power, having fired around 4,000 missiles and, according to Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark Milley, have lost some 100,000 personnel to death or injury. Morale is low. Special units are sent to the front lines to shoot retreating soldiers and deserters. Multiple Russian commanders have failed to secure victory. However, despite Washington’s expectations, Putin will not abandon the fight. His regime views the stakes as existential for him and for Russia. Moscow wants Ukraine to remain part of its strategic security perimeter, on which it relied for centuries. Putin will continue to enforce his version of the Monroe Doctrine to keep troops and influence out of a country that has a 1400-mile border with Russia. President Biden and his Russia counterpart Vladimir Putin have not spoken in months. - - Under the new ""asymmetric"" strategy, Moscow is targeting critical infrastructure to leave Ukrainians without water, electricity and heat as winter approaches. Missile and drone strikes on Kyiv’s electrical grid have left half a million homes without power. Local authorities are mulling evacuation plans should the city become unlivable. Forty percent of the country’s energy infrastructure has been crippled, and multiple industries have incurred devastating cyber strikes. Loss of power will result in lack of water, causing sewage problems that will spread disease. In late October, Ukraine’s intelligence services uncovered Russia’s plot to blow up the Nova Kakhovka hydroelectric dam to trigger a massive flood in southern Ukraine. Couple that with a dirty bomb in Kherson, and a large swath of the country will become an environmental disaster. The main target in this phase of war is the population, its psychological state and its will to fight. Putin’s Health and Regime Stability Endless rumors abound about Putin’s deteriorating physical and mental condition – anything from thyroid to pancreatic cancer, to Parkinson’s, a mysterious mental illness caused by -related isolation, and more. It is impossible, even for U.S. intelligence, to assess Putin’s health with high accuracy. Putin takes extreme measures – including having his security personnel collect his excrement and urine when he travels - to safeguard information about his health. There is no credible evidence Putin has a chronic condition like cancer. Instead, Putin appears ""entirely too healthy,"" as Director William Burns recently assessed. Russian President Vladimir Putin with troops. Rumors are swirling about the marks on Putin's hand. Two weeks ago, the Russian strongman put on a three-hour performance, including a speech and Q&A, at the annual international ""Valdai"" conference hosted by Russia. Putin was lucid, forceful, confident and looked healthy. There is no credible evidence suggesting the imminent collapse of Putin’s regime, his ouster or forced retirement into a sanatorium. What the future holds Putin is preparing for the long haul and even an all-out war, anticipating intervention. Moscow has mobilized additional 318,000 men and mandated basic military training in high school. It has expanded military cooperation with Iran and North Korea to replenish its depleting weapons supply. Russia is standing up bomb shelters, training police in wartime protocols and conducting emergency evacuation drills. Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine is now into its ninth month with no end in sight The Biden administration’s solution to the Russia-Ukraine problem has been to hit Russia with more sanctions, deprive another Russian oligarch of his yacht or palace and send billions in aid to Ukraine. This is naïve and simplistic. The question of control over the post-Soviet space has been festering since the collapse of the in 1991, and the balance of power in Eurasia has been contested for centuries. So victory is not around the corner, nor will it be defined by President Biden. That the Washington establishment is dragging America into yet another geopolitical experiment as Ukrainians are being slaughtered and their country ruined is irresponsible and dangerous. We are dealing with a nuclear power that is predisposed for the worst-case scenario thinking, and it will invoke the worst case before it accepts defeat in Ukraine.",7,4.577084555486351,4.101097930666193,0.4759866248201581,14

Russia is looking to add more sophisticated weaponry to its stocks and ordered ""several dozen"" Tsirkon hypersonic missiles this fall, state-owned news outlet reported Friday. The order is reportedly set to be fulfilled by the end of 2023 and comes after the Kremlin order a ""batch of Tsirkons"" during the summer of 2021. The report comes just days after Tehran, which has aided Russia in its war in Ukraine, announced that it had developed its own hypersonic missile – prompting some to question of whether Moscow had assisted its Middle Eastern ally in developing the sophisticated weaponry, though U.S. defense officials have expressed skepticism over the authenticity of Tehran's claims. - In this file photo taken from a video distributed by Russian Defense Ministry Press Service, on Dec. 9, 2020, a ground-based intercontinental ballistic missile was launched from the Plesetsk facility in northwestern Russia. Hypersonic missiles are not only capable of traveling over five times faster than the speed of sound, at a rate of 3,800 mph, they also can travel on complex trajectories, which makes them difficult to defend against, the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute reported. Russian armed forces have reportedly launched ""multiple"" hypersonic missiles in Ukraine since the war began, according to top U.S. defense officials, though it remains unclear how many of the missiles remain in Russia's stocks. The Kremlin has seen significant setbacks in its arms supplies and ability to hold its military lines in Ukraine, and Kyiv saw one of its greatest achievements Friday after Russian forces withdrew from the southern city of Kherson. While Ukraine and Western allies have championed Ukraine’s advancement, former intelligence officer for Russian Doctrine & Strategy Rebekah Koffler cautioned that the withdrawal could be a trap. Russia said it tested a hypersonic Zircon cruise missile in the Barents Sea, Saturday, May 28, 2022. 'S '' ""Things are very fluid now,"" she told Fox News Digital.

Australian Federal Police took the unusual step of attributing blame for the unsolved cybercrime that resulted in the personal data of 9.7 million current and former Medibank customers being stolen. A group of ""loosely affiliated cybercriminals"" operating like a business in Russia were likely responsible for the Medibank attack as well as other significant security breaches around the world, Australian Federal Police Commissioner Reece Kershaw said. ""We believe we know which individuals are responsible, but I will not be naming them,"" Kershaw told reporters. ""What I will say is that we’ll be holding talks with Russian law enforcement about these individuals."" Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, who is a Medibank customer who had personal data stolen, said he had authorized police to reveal where the attack had come from. ""We know where they’re coming from, we know who is responsible, and we say that they should be held to account,"" Albanese said. ""The nation where these attacks are coming from should also be held accountable for the disgusting attacks, and the release of information including very private and personal information,"" Albanese added. An official from the Russian Embassy in Australia could not be immediately contacted for comment. The extortionists have been linked to high-profile Russian cybercrime gang vil, short for Ransomware Evil and also known as Sodinokibi. The Russian Federal Security Service said in January vil ""ceased to exist"" after several arrests were made at the insistence of the United States. An old vil dark web site had started redirecting traffic to a new site that hosts the stolen Medibank data. Fergus Hanson, director of Australian Strategic Policy Institute think tank’s cyber policy center, said he was not surprised that the crime gang was based in Russia. 2 A Medibank employee’s stolen username and password, which allowed the hackers to enter the company’s database, had been sold on a Russian dark web forum, Hanson said. Hanson doubted that culprits operating in Russia would be brought to justice. But Australia could use its offensive cyber capabilities against the gang in Russia and prosecute their affiliates, who police suspect are operating in other countries. ""There’s potential to conduct operations against the group to disrupt their operations, but in terms of seeing them go to prison or appear before a court, I think that’s pretty unlikely,"" Hanson told Australian Broadcasting Corp. People walk past a Medibank branch in Sydney on Nov. 11, 2022. Extortionists have dumped personal medical records on the dark web for a third day as they pressure Australia's largest health insurer to pay a ransom. Cybercriminals dumped personal medical records on the dark web for a third day on Friday, this time focusing on alcohol-related illnesses, as they pressure Medibank to pay a ransom. The criminals began dumping customer records Wednesday, including those involving treatments for and drug addiction, which they described as a ""naughty"" list, after Medibank ruled out paying a ransom for the return of the hacked data. The focus shifted to terminated pregnancies in Thursday’s dump and on Friday to conditions related to harmful levels of alcohol consumption, in a file the thieves labeled ""boozy."" Medical treatment records of more than 700 customers had been published through Friday in what has been described as Australia’s most invasive cybercrime. Other personal details of many more customers have also been made public that could leave them vulnerable to identity theft or fraud, including phone numbers and email addresses. Confirming the third dump, Medibank David Koczkar said his company was contacting exposed customers and offering support. He expected the daily dumps would continue. ""The relentless nature of this tactic being used by the criminal is designed to cause distress and harm,"" Koczkar said. , ""These are real people behind this data and the misuse of their data is deplorable and may discourage them from seeking medical care,"" he added. The gang, which is becoming increasingly better known as BlogXX within cybersecurity circles, blamed Medibank's failure to pay a $9.7 million ransom demand. ""But we warned you. we always keep our word, if we wouldn't receive a ransom - we should post this data, because nobody will believe us in the future,"" they posted on Friday. Kershaw said Australian government policy did not condone paying ransoms to cybercriminals. ""Any ransom payment, small or large, fuels the cybercrime business model, putting other Australians at risk,"" Kershaw said. Australian authorities are hoping the data remains confined to the dark web and is not spread to a wider audience by social media or reported in detail by the news media. Albanese urged against anyone accessing the data. ""We need to provide a disincentive for this sort of criminal, disgusting behavior that is reprehensible,"" Albanese said.",20,5.958920376918897,5.373456443589432,0.5854639333294651,8

They are not the most dangerous thing Russia is using against Ukraine in this war, but they are arguably one of the scariest. They are Iranian-made Russian-launched drones. They are small…only about 9 feet by 9 feet. They are relatively slow…they only travel at about a hundred miles an hour. And they make a lot of noise…like a lawn mower or a moped. However, they can be sent from a thousand miles away or more.

As their progress slows on the battle front, Russian forces have been targeting civilian infrastructure. With winter closing in, and power, heat and water going, it could be Moscow’s most dangerous tactic. ""Militarily it’s absolutely nothing,"" Ukrainian Member of Parliament Oleksiy Goncharenko explained, ""but yes, it can cause a lot of suffering for civilians."" The numbers tell the tale.

The Foundation for the Defense of Democracies reported that Iran may even increase its support and provide Russia with short-range ballistic missiles, a move that indicates any economic relief Tehran would gain through the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action — also known as the Iran nuclear deal — would end up funding Russia’s war and undercut U.S. sanctions. ""With reports that Iran plans to send short-range ballistic missiles to Russia to use against Ukraine — and as the people of Iran cry out in the streets for a change in regime — the U.S. and its European allies should withdraw all sanctions relief offers made to Tehran and complete the snapback of U.N. sanctions at the Security Council,"" Richard Goldberg, a senior advisor at the , wrote in an analysis published Wednesday. , The transfer would include Fateh-110 and Zulfiqar short-range ballistic missiles. The Fateh-110 can reach a distance of 150-180 miles, while the Zulfiqar could potentially reach targets within 435 miles. Iran already sent over 3,500 drones to Russia, with most of the units produced in factories operated by the Iranian Ministry of Defense and the Iranian Aviation and Space Industries Association .

Weapons alone will not win the war as Putin also looked to replenish his depleted forces. After months of silence about the true number of casualties, both Director William Burns and British Intelligence Chief Richard Moore indicated that Russia lost around 15,000 troops over the first five months of the invasion. ""We've seen for months now attempts by Russia to recruit sort of their own version of the foreign legion, of particular communities by the Wagner Group in the field from Syria, from Libya, from the Central African Republic,"" Goldberg told Fox News Digital. ""We've heard reports of Serbians, as well, fighting on the pro-Russia side."" 'S : ""[One of] the main motivations for doing this for the Russians is they're quickly depleting their own forces,"" Goldberg explained. ""They are moving into reserve call-ups, and they don't want to have to continue taxing the Russian population wherever possible. ""So to the extent that they can lean on foreign troops to do the work, to have non-Russians fighting and dying rather than Russian bodies coming home to their families, that's their preference,"" he added, noting that Putin is seeking ""low-cost, high-impact systems."" Russian and Belarusian armed forces take part in a military drill in Gomel, Belarus, Feb. 19. Putin attempted to replenish his forces through a forced enlistment by announcing a ""partial mobilization,"" but many Russian men decided to flee the country rather than join Putin’s war in Ukraine. Russia had already drawn in Chechen fighters in the early phase of the Ukraine war after it became clear the conflict would not end as soon as Putin had believed and would require more commitment. Reports started to emerge over the following months of Russia reaching out to friendly nations and seeking reinforcements. The New York Times in April reported that Putin had looked to Syrian and Georgian fighters to bolster its forces. And multiple Afghan military and security sources last week said that elite National Army Commando Corps soldiers started joining the Russian forces after the U.S. left behind the 20,000 to 30,000-member force following its military drawdown. Ukrainian firefighters put out a fire after a strike in Zaporizhzhia Oct. 6, 2022, amid the Russian invasion of Ukraine. As many as 10,000 of the former commandos were initially inclined to accept Russia’s offer, Foreign Policy reported. Goldberg likened Russia’s growing coalition to Ukraine’s International Legion, which Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy established at the start of the conflict. It drew 20,000 volunteers from 52 countries in the first week. ""Moscow is running low both military hardware and personnel, having to fill the gaps with non-indigenous capabilities. It’s procuring weapons from Iran and North Korea and is relying on the mercenary contingent, the Wagner Group, the Chechen fighters, Kadyrov, to replenish its regular forces,"" Koffler said. ""They are even recruiting prisoners and bringing in former Afghan security forces, who were displaced as the Taliban came back to power, after the U.S. withdrawal. ""Despite all of these limitations, Putin will not back down. To the contrary, he is preparing for an all-out fight with the U.S. and and switching to asymmetric strategy.""

Iranian instructors have been spotted in Belarus teaching Russian forces to coordinate drone strikes with the Iranian-made drone system, leading to further fears that Belarus' role in the conflict in Ukraine may soon escalate.

2022-10-15,Fox,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/us-signals-slowdown-high-end-munitions-deliveries-ukraine,US poised for slowdown in high-end munitions deliveries to Ukraine,"U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin pledged to stand by Ukraine in their war against Russia ""for as long as it takes,"" in Wednesday remarks to the Ukraine Defense Contact Group in Belgium. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin signaled this week that the U.S. and its Western allies are having trouble keeping pace with Ukraine’s demand for the advanced weaponry it needs to fend off Russia’s invasion. That signal reflects dwindling supplies for Ukraine and fear in the White House of escalation that could lead to war between the U.S. and Russia. The risk of reduced U.S. stockpiles of high-end munitions has been reported almost since the U.S. began contributing to Ukraine’s defense. Now, nearly eight months since the start of the war, experts interviewed by Fox News Digital say the U.S. is at or very near the end of its capacity to give. They agreed that Austin’s remarks indicate that the initial rush of high-end munitions like rocket launchers, Javelin anti-tank missiles, anti-aircraft Stingers and M-777 Howitzers is over. These sources said there may be two factors at play that are contributing to this reality. One factor is the issue that Austin addressed directly this week – the U.S. is running low on equipment that it can hand over to Ukraine. , ‘’ In this photo released by Ukrainian Presidential Press Office, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy leads a meeting of the National Security and Defense Council in Kyiv, Ukraine, Friday, Sept. 30, 2022. At a press conference Wednesday, Austin was asked whether the U.S. and other nations are worried about running so low on domestic supplies of critical munitions that they can no longer help Ukraine. Austin dodged the question by stressing that the desire is there to get Ukraine what it needs, but he left unsaid whether Ukraine’s allies can actually deliver. ""Well, it certainly is not a question of lack of will,"" Austin replied. Austin had just concluded a meeting with officials from dozens of countries about Ukraine’s munitions needs. As he described that meeting, he again talked about willpower but hinted at strained capacity to provide more for Ukraine, which is using up munitions faster than the world can deliver them. 'S ‘’ : ""We will produce and deliver these highly effective capabilities over the course of the coming months — and in some cases years — even as we continue to meet Ukraine’s most pressing self-defense requirements in real time,"" Austin said of the most recent commitment to send , vehicles, radar systems and other equipment. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin testifies before a House subcommittee in Washington, D.C., on May 11, 2022. Mark Cancian is a senior adviser at the Center for Strategic & International Studies who spent seven years working on procurement issues for the Office of Management and Budget. His assessment based on inventory levels, industrial capacity, and information from the Biden administration is that the U.S. has ""limited"" supplies of s, Javelins, Stingers and M-777 Howitzers. ""There are some areas where we’re basically at the bottom of the barrel,"" he told Fox News Digital. In some cases, this means the U.S. will likely start meeting Ukraine’s request for weaponry by sending over lower-end substitutions, such as lighter Howitzers that are serviceable but not what Ukraine is after. In other cases, the U.S. may not have much to give – Cancian said that while there is talk of the U.S. providing more air defense equipment, there is not much the U.S. can give in that area. Cancian said he reads Austin comments as a sign that the days of the U.S. giving Ukraine its best stuff are gone. ‘ ’ ""It confirmed what I believe, that we will continue support Ukraine, but we’re going to have to do it in different ways, like providing substitutes, or we might have to buy stuff from other people, or it will take longer,"" he said. ""That it won’t be quite the same."" He said this runs the risk of creating what he called a ""petting zoo of equipment"" in Ukraine – relatively small numbers of many types of equipment that could create compatibility issues. Some on Capitol Hill are reading Austin’s remark differently that leads to largely the same result – that the Biden administration is purposefully slowing down the transfer of critical munitions to Ukraine, because it is increasingly worried about stumbling into a direct conflict with Russia. Photo of Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and President Biden A congressional aide with working knowledge of these issues told Fox News Digital that while officials are hinting at limited supplies, there is still room to give more, and that the slowdown is because of a different calculation the Biden administration is making. ""They are afraid of escalation,"" this aide said. Just last week, President Biden openly talked about the ""Armageddon"" scenario that could unfold if Russia tried to win the war with a tactical nuclear strike. The congressional aide interpreted Austin’s remarks as a sign the administration is more and more worried about crossing a line that might force that outcome. Another sign of U.S. caution, the aide said, is that the administration allowed nearly $2.8 billion in authority to supply Ukraine with weapons to expire a few weeks ago, at the end of fiscal year 2022. Some on Capitol Hill are reading that as an indication that the administration is finding its own comfort level when it comes to arming Ukraine, and that level stops short of what Congress authorized. ""Congress gave the administration more than it wanted,"" the aide said. The Defense Department declined to respond to questions from Fox News Digital about the expiration of this authority. - ‘ ’ Destroyed Russian armored vehicles left behind by the Russian forces in Izium, Kharkiv, Ukraine on Oct. 2, 2022. There is a related view within Congress that while U.S. stocks of certain munitions have clearly been reduced as the U.S. sends items to Ukraine, that reduction is not a security threat to the United States itself. The aide explained that many of these items were stockpiled largely for use in a possible conflict with Russia, and that conflict is already playing out with Ukraine in the lead. That conflict is reducing Russia’s military capacity, which means a corresponding drop in U.S. inventories is not putting the U.S. anywhere near a stockpile crisis. To put it another way: the Biden administration has more flexibility to give Ukraine more but is choosing not to. The evolving U.S. posture comes just as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is intensifying pressure on Western nations to provide more weapons. Just this week, Zelenskyy asked for air defense systems that can blunt Russia’s recent missile attacks on Ukraine’s capital. ""The 229th day of full-scale war,"" he said. ""On the 229th day, they are trying to destroy us and wipe us off the face of the earth.""",49,4.5514782317393445,3.8213043289778024,0.7301739027615421,9
2022-10-14,Fox,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/putins-cyber-armageddon-doctrine-seeks-expand-russias-offense-beyond-battlefield,Putin’s cyber Armageddon doctrine seeks to expand Russia's offense beyond battlefield,"Former U.S. Defense intelligence officer Rebekah Koffler says Putin is switching his strategy to a 'new generation warfare.' The Russian cybercriminal group KillNet struck the websites of multiple U.S. airports with distributed denial-of-service attacks, taking them off-line temporarily on Monday. On Tuesday, Killnet claimed another cyberattack, blocking the entire network infrastructure of the largest U.S. bank, organ. A spokesperson for the bank said that no operations were impacted, without denying that its networks were compromised by a cyber intrusion. Across the Atlantic, Russia unleashed a barrage of missile and drone strikes throughout Ukraine in an apparent escalation of it seven-month war against its post-Soviet neighbor. Russian cyberstrikes on the U.S. homeland are almost certainly part of Putin’s shift in strategy, expanding Russia’s offensive operations beyond the actual battlefield in Ukraine and into the cyber domain. This week’s cyber intrusions may have been Putin’s ""shot across the bow,"" signaling to Washington that Russia possesses the capability to inflict devastating damage. White House spokesman John Kirby’s statement that it is too soon to know if Kremlin was behind the cyberstrikes on U.S. airports is naïve. It is a false distinction whether a Russian government employee or a KillNet hacker pulled the cyber trigger. Russian intelligence routinely hires cybercriminals to do its dirty work, to ensure plausible deniability. : , ' ,' ', , , 911' A hand on the keyboard is seen with binary code displayed on a laptop screen in this illustration photo taken in Krakow, Poland on Aug. 17, 2021. Moscow believes that in Ukraine, Russia is fighting a proxy war with the Washington, given that the U.S. government has been providing top-of-the-line weaponry and other support to Kyiv that has dramatically enhanced Ukraine’s warfighting capabilities. On Tuesday, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov remarked that the United States is ""de facto"" a participant in Ukraine war, probably signaling that Russia believes it is justified in targeting the U.S., albeit non-kinetically. Moscow’s goal is to place psychological pressure on Americans by gradually destabilizing the normal functioning of the society via cyber strikes, in order to persuade us to abandon support for Ukraine. The Russians view cyber as a low-cost, flexible, non-kinetic tool capable of dialing the pain inflicted on the opponent up and down, until it reaches the threshold of ""unacceptable damage."" Russian military planners have concluded that a direct war between Russia and the U.S. is inevitable, given that two have been in confrontation over the control of the post-Soviet states bordering Russia, the area that Moscow views as its sphere of influence and security perimeter – that is, its version of the Monroe Doctrine. 'S , 'S - Fearing Washington's conventional superiority, Russian strategists conceptualized a cyberwarfare doctrine, which they believe would allow them to exploit American’s reliance on technology both in daily life and in military operations. Russia has studied our vulnerabilities and has already practiced conducting cyber intrusions into our networks and computer systems for two decades. A previously highly classified cyber multi-year Russian cyber operation code named by U.S. investigators as ""Moonlight Maze"" dates back to 1999. In it, the Russians breached multiple U.S. government and military agencies, including weapons labs, and exfiltrated massive amounts of sensitive data. The Russians have compromised the networks of many sectors of the economy and countless government agencies, including the White House, the State Department and the Pentagon. Russia is considered by U.S. intelligence to be the most formidable foreign cyber actor, with a flexible arsenal capable of producing carefully tailored effects. The attacks of the airport websites on Monday did not affect the systems that handle air traffic control, internal airline communications and transportation security, causing only a temporary inconvenience. Russia’s ransomware attack on the Colonial Pipeline, a critical part of U.S. petroleum infrastructure, supplying around half of the East Coast’s fuel, did more damage. The six-day shutdown of the pipeline, which transports 2.5 million barrels per day of gasoline, diesel fuel, heating oil and jet fuel, resulted in gas shortages, outages at gas stations, price hikes, long lines, and panicking consumers. Similarly, Russia’s ransomware attack on , which processes one-fifth of the nation’s meat supply, raised the issue of food security and affordability. Putin, in the wake of Biden's comments, says Russia knows ""how to defend our own interests."" The most destructive cyber weapon is a computer worm capable of taking over programmable systems of critical infrastructure. The Russians have been mapping out access to U.S. critical infrastructure facilities and conducting proof-of-concept operations, as part of what is called in the intelligence business ""cyber preparation of the battlefield."" However, even carefully planned cyber operation of this complexity can get out of control and spill over into unintended targets, resulting in cascading impact and wreaking havoc across global cyberspace. As we saw in the case of Stuxnet, a U.S.-Israeli computer worm that was covertly deployed to a uranium enrichment facility in Iran to sabotage and slow down the Iranian nuclear program. Although Stuxnet achieved its mission of destroying numerous centrifuges in Iran’s Natanz uranium enrichment facility by causing them to burn themselves out, the virus mutated and spread to other ""supervisory control and data acquisition,"" or , systems installed in similar power plants, infecting other energy-producing facilities and wreaking havoc all over the world. As the first known computer virus that actually crippled hardware, Stuxnet was a ""game changer"" in cyber warfare, earning respect from cybersecurity researchers and instilling fear in governments, including the Kremlin. It is unclear if Russia has a Stuxnet-like capability, but the Kremlin took careful note of it. Capitalizing on spying tools believed to have been developed by the U.S. National Security Agency, hackers staged a cyber assault with a self-spreading malware that has infected tens of thousands of computers in nearly 100 countries. Since at least March 2016, six of the 16 sectors designated by the Department of Homeland Security as critical have been penetrated by the Russians, including energy, water, aviation, commercial facilities, critical manufacturing and nuclear facilities. In June 2018, top Trump administration officials were advised that the threat to the U.S. electric grid was so serious, that the country needed to prepare for a catastrophic power outage, possibly caused by a cyberattack. Following Russia’s attacks on U.S. airports on Monday, the director of the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency , warned about ""potential attacks on U.S. critical infrastructure,"" remarking that the ""Russians are very unpredictable"" and ""their back is up against the wall."" On Thursday released twenty-five advisories, flagging current security vulnerabilities and exploits surrounding our Industrial Control Systems and providing mitigation recommendations. In the first recorded cyberattack on a power grid outside a military conflict, Russia temporarily shut down Ukraine’s power grid in a crippling operation during Christmas of 2015, causing a blackout for 250,000 people in freezing temperatures. Putin will almost certainly not resort to launch a similarly debilitating attack on the U.S. homeland in peacetime. However, if Moscow and Washington are indeed in a direct kinetic war, and especially if Putin is cornered and facing defeat, unleashing Cyber Armageddon is an integral part of Putin’s Playbook.",20,4.726542983778746,5.7064112549771195,-0.9798682711983737,24

The new package includes rounds for the High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems, known as , a critical weapon that has improved Ukraine’s ability to strike ammunition depots, bridges and other key targets that erode Russia’s ability to resupply troops. The U.S. has already sent 20 to Ukraine, and has promised 18 more that would be delivered in the coming years. Last week, the British government said it would provide missiles for advanced anti-aircraft systems that the Pentagon plans to send to Ukraine. Britain is also sending hundreds of drones and 18 howitzer artillery guns. Germany has sent the first of four promised -T air defense systems, France pledged more artillery, anti-aircraft systems and missiles, the Netherlands said it would send missiles, and Canada is planning to send winter equipment, drone cameras and satellite communications. Russia has intensified attacks on Ukraine after the bombing of a bridge that links to Crimea, which Moscow annexed in 2014. The bridge holds important strategic value to Moscow, which has seen multiple setbacks on the battlefield. Most recently, Russia has sent bombers to an airbase on the Kola Peninsula roughly 100 miles from Finland and Norway ahead of nuclear exercises in Europe. Satellite images obtained by Fox News show nearly a dozen supersonic and other long-range bombers capable of launching nuclear weapons. The deployment of Cold War bombers comes days after Russian President Vladimir Putin threatened to potentially launch a low-yield nuclear strike on Ukraine, saying there was historical ""precedent,"" a reference to the U.S. dropping nuclear bombs on Japan at the end of World War . The Russian show of force near the Barents Sea comes as kicks-off annual nuclear exercises of its own, which will involve U.S. B-52 bombers flying from their base in North Dakota over Europe.

According to Russian milbloggers, one commander from the 58th Combined Arms Army of the Southern Military District, Mikhail Zusko, apparently ordered the ""immediate deployment without any pre-combat training of newly mobilized servicemen."" These conscripts were sent to fight for the 15th Regiment in 27th Motor Rifle Brigade in one of the most brutal warfronts in Ukraine near the city of Svatove in Luhansk. Milbloggers reported that half of this regiment was later found by relatives at a Russian hospital in the Belgorod Oblast, roughly 40 miles from Ukraine, after the unit came under heavy fire when attempting to reach the frontline near Svatove.

Instead of striking targets kinetically, Russian forces and military intelligence will seek to disrupt the ‘kill chain’ by attacking Ukraine’s command and control non-kinetically."" ""The targets will be primarily critical infrastructure, including civilian, as we’ve seen today. Transportation, banking, telecommunications, dams. The goal is to disrupt the normal functioning of the society—create floods, turn off electricity—in order to unbalance the Kyiv regime and frighten the population so they give up the fight,"" she added.

Meet Putin's new top general for Ukraine,"Russian President Vladimir Putin appointed General Sergei Surovikin to lead Russia's invasion of Ukraine on Friday, and it took no time at all for the infamous commander to bring his tactics from the Middle East to Europe. Surovikin's appointment represents the first time Russian troops in Ukraine will all answer to a single commander. The general first gained notoriety in 1991 for ordering Russian soldiers to fire on protesting civilians in Moscow in the final months of the Soviet Union. He displayed similar brutality when Putin deployed him to Syria in 2017, allegedly ordering the indiscriminate bombings of Aleppo and other anti-government strongholds. Surovikin has also been accused of complicity in the use of chemical weapons in Syria. Surovikin has been imprisoned in Russia twice over his career, once for selling weapons and again for ordering the shooting of civilians in Moscow, according to the Guardian.

He fought alongside Soviet loyalists who attempted a coup against Mikhail Gorbachev in 1991. He drove a vehicle through pro-democracy barricades in the Capital and ordered his soldiers to fire on civilians, killing three people. Yevgeny Prigozhin, the founder of the Wagner private military company, praised Putin's decision to appoint Surovikin this weekend. ""Surovikin is the most able commander in the Russian army,"" Prigozhin said, according to the Guardian. ""He was born to serve his motherland faithfully. Having received an order in 1991, Surovikin was that officer who without hesitation got in his tank and went forward to save his country."" ‘’ Intelligence experts have warned that Surovikin's appointment could also signal that Putin is moving one step closer to ordering the use of tactical nuclear weapons. The decision to use such weapons would have vast consequences for Russia, and Putin would need to have commanders on the ground willing to carry out the order. ""So they have already signaled their intent, but they would need commanders who would have the capability to do it,"" Military analyst and head of McKenzie Intelligence Forbes McKenzie told Sky News. ""This is a man who has used chemical weapons in recent history, so that demonstrates capability.""

Surovikin previously held command of the Southern group in June and Commander-in-Chief of the Russian Aerospace Forces in 2017.

2022-10-04,Fox,https://www.foxnews.com/us/us-warns-foreign-efforts-sway-american-voters,US warns about foreign efforts to sway American voters,"Federal officials are warning ahead of the November midterms that Russia is working to amplify doubts about the integrity of U.S. elections while China is interested in undermining American politicians it sees as threats to Beijing’s interests. An unclassified intelligence advisory, newly obtained by The Associated Press, says China is probably seeking to influence select races to ""hinder candidates perceived to be particularly adversarial to Beijing."" In the advisory, sent to state and local officials in mid-September, intelligence officials said they believe Beijing sees a lower risk in meddling in the midterms versus a presidential election. While officials said they've not identified any credible threats to election infrastructure in the U.S., the latest intelligence warning comes amid the peak of a midterm campaign in which a rising number of candidates and voters openly express a lack of confidence in the nation's democratic processes. Foreign countries have long sought to sway public opinion in America, perhaps most notably in a covert Russian campaign that used social media to sow discord on hot-button social issues ahead of the 2016 presidential election. The U.S. government has been on high alert since, warning about efforts by Russia, China and Iran to meddle in American politics and shape how voters think. 30- - Kathie Hoekstra arrives to vote in Alexandria, Va., Monday, Sept. 26, 2022. In-person voting for the midterm elections has started in Minnesota, South Dakota, Virginia and Wyoming, in a landscape that has changed since the pandemic drove a shift to mail balloting in the 2020 presidential contest. The U.S. faces foreign influence campaigns while still dealing with growing threats to election workers domestically and the systematic spread of falsehoods and disinformation about voter fraud. Former President Donald Trump and many of his supporters — including candidates running to oversee elections in several states — continue to lie about the 2020 presidential election even as no evidence has emerged of significant voter fraud. ""The current environment is pretty complex, arguably much more complex than it was in 2020,"" Jen Easterly, director of the Department of Homeland Security's cybersecurity arm, told reporters Monday. Russia is amplifying divisive topics already circulating on the Internet — including doubts about the integrity of American elections — but not creating its own content, said a senior official who briefed reporters Monday on the condition of anonymity under terms set by the bureau. Overall, the official said, China’s efforts are focused more on shaping policy perspectives, including at the state and local level, rather than on electoral outcomes. 2020 Jean Pogue, who turns 100 this month, says she likes going to vote because, ""you get to go to one of those little booths and you look at that fancy ballot."" Still, China appears to have focused its attention on a ""subset of candidates"" in the U.S. it sees as opposed to its policy interests, the official explained. In one high-profile case, the Justice Department in March charged Chinese operatives in a plot to undermine the candidacy of a Chinese dissident and student leader of the Tiananmen Square protests in 1989 who was running for a congressional seat in New York. The briefing Monday came weeks after distributed an advisory that described China’s approach during this midterm as different from the 2020 election, when the intelligence community assessed that China considered but did not deploy efforts to influence the presidential election. There were publicly revealed examples during the last presidential election of influence campaigns originating in China. Facebook in September 2020 took down pages that posted what it said was a ""small amount of content"" on the election; that effort focused primarily on the South China Sea. The advisory doesn’t list specific races or states where it thinks China-linked actors might operate, but cites the March indictment alleging efforts to undermine the New York congressional candidate. It also suggests China's interest in politics extends beyond the U.S., saying Australian intelligence since 2017 has scrutinized Chinese government attempts to support legislators or candidates, including those who have amplified Beijing's stances on select issues. A Kentucky Democrat put in ad in a publication appearing to depict a lynching. A spokesperson said the department regularly shares threat information with federal, state and local officials. Chinese and Russian officials and state media have historically rejected U.S. allegations of election meddling and pointed in turn to American influence efforts in other countries. State and local governments are limited in what they can do against influence campaigns, given that ""their job isn't to police political conversation,"" said Larry Norden, an election security expert with the Brennan Center for Justice. ""I do think there is a lot voters should be doing,"" he added. ""If they are seeing messages about candidates presented in an alarmist or emotionally charged way, their radar should be going up. They should be checking the accuracy of claims, and if they are seeing false claims, they should be letting the social media companies know."" ' ' , - 24: People use voting machines to fill out their ballots as they vote in the Georgia primary at the Metropolitan Library on May 24, 2022 in Atlanta, Georgia. Scott Bates, the deputy secretary of state in Connecticut, noted that election officials in the state had responded to warnings about foreign influence dating back to 2016. ""Our best defense is to have an educated populace,"" he said. He drew a distinction between misinformation about election processes and misinformation about a candidate or campaign. ""The election process, we can protect that,"" he said. ""If you're talking about talking trash about a candidate, we're not in the business of patrolling that."" , Nineteen foreign nationals have been charged with illegally voting in the 2016 election, the Justice Department said Friday. Some signs of influence operations from Russia and China are already public. Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, said in late September that it disabled a sprawling disinformation network coming from Russia involving sham news websites and hundreds of fake social media accounts. Researchers also exposed a much smaller network originating in China that was intended to spread divisive political content in the U.S., but reached only a tiny audience. Officials at the and said Monday they were not aware of any credible threat to election infrastructure. A senior official said that though officials were not tracking any specific effort by a foreign government to hack election equipment, they were nonetheless concerned that an adversary could spread exaggerated or false claims of compromise to undermine confidence in the elections.

Since then, it has received and reviewed more than 1,000 reports of harassing communication.

""Dead bodies smell the same everywhere,"" special operations Marine veteran Chad Robichaux said, describing the grizzly sight he witnessed this week. ""The distinct smell of decaying people. Just to know that, that was women and children and non-combatants,"" he continued before adding, ""Russia has the most land in the world – comes in and takes more. And to just do this to these people who can't defend themselves. ""It's just hard not to be emotionally upset, angry. It's just, it's disgusting,"" he added. Bags with dead bodies are seen during the exhumation in the recently retaken area of Izyum, Ukraine, Friday, Sept. 16, 2022. 'S According to Robichaux and one of his partners with the Mighty Oaks Program – which has been in Ukraine since February assisting soldiers on the front lines with trauma and medical counseling – Ukrainian forces this week discovered a series of partially covered mass graves in an area one hour southeast of Izyum. The special ops veteran said he was not permitted to disclose the exact location of the site but said it was clear Russian soldiers were trying to conceal evidence of war crimes. Some 1,100 Ukrainian men, women and children, many with their hands bound behind their backs, were reportedly found in several pits roughly 20 feet by 30 feet that had been originally dug out to hide Russian tanks. ""They tried to burn the evidence of the bodies,"" Robichaux said. ""But they didn’t do a very good job of it. ""They actually left 74 tanks in this one area and they were using the tank positions to put the bodies in,"" he explained. Ukrainian troops retook a wide swath of territory from Russia on Monday, pushing all the way back to the northeastern border in some places, and claimed to have captured many Russian soldiers as part of a lightning advance that forced Moscow to make a hasty retreat. 450 , Disturbing reports of extreme violence and war crimes committed against civilians, including other mass grave sites, evidence of torture, and the extreme living conditions Ukrainians were forced to endure during six months of Russian occupation, continue to emerge as Russian forces retreat from areas in southeast Kharkiv. Russian forces have largely retreated from areas surrounding Izyum in southeast Kharkiv, but Robichaux explained that doesn’t mean Russian soldiers are no longer a threat. ""Just because Ukraine retakes control of an area doesn’t mean that equates to no Russians,"" he said. Robichaux described a chaotic scene and said he and his team were with Ukrainian forces on the front lines where attacks by Russian forces overhead and on the ground remain a very real threat. At least 60 deceased Russian soldiers were found this week as they continued to advance in the area, along with 15 Russian troops who surrendered. Reports of Russia’s inability to maintain command and control in its ranks have emerged in the weeks following Ukraine’s major counteroffensive, and, according to Robichaux, these issues stem from a lack of basic communication among Russia’s soldiers. ""They don't have inner team communications like we would normally have, so they have no way to communicate,"" he said adding they do not appear well-trained or even know how to navigate. ""They're just lost and walking around. Almost like they have to get picked up because they wouldn't survive."" Robichaux described the harsh dichotomy of war and said the Russian soldiers he’s seen were not only under-trained but young and ""terrified."" Part of the body of a Ukrainian soldier is uncovered during an exhumation in the recently retaken area of Izium, Ukraine, Friday, Sept. 16, 2022. ""You see these Russian soldiers, these kids who are like 18,19, 20 years old. It's hard not to feel sorry for them because they're just kids that were forced to be out there. But then they participated in this,"" he said, referring to the litany of human rights abuses that have been reported. The International Criminal Court and several nations, including the U.S. and its European allies, have opened investigations into the alleged war crimes. But the special ops veteran argued the West should be doing more to help Ukraine win this war more efficiently and faster. ""Bullies don't stop bullying until somebody walks across the playground and punches him in the face,"" he said. ""It's a problem that won't go away until somebody draws a line and does something about it. ""The world needs to know,"" Robichaux added.",45,4.032853648373685,4.239871163979579,-0.20701751560589443,16

The head of a monitoring mission set up by the U.N. human rights office said Tuesday that Russia must address such mistreatment, which amounts a ""grave violation"" of international law. The mission issued its first comprehensive look at rights violations and abuses committed by both sides of the war between Feb. 1 and July 31 — covering the first months after Russian forces invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24. The mission, which tracks the situation daily, has been monitoring rights in Ukraine ever since a conflict involving Russian-backed insurgents began in eastern Ukraine in 2014. A ?

In the cases it documented, the mission found that the ""vast majority"" of Ukrainian prisoners of war were subjected to ""torture or cruel and degrading treatment by the detaining power,"" a statement from the mission said. Matilda Bogner, the mission’s chief, said such mistreatment of Ukrainian s ""appears to be systematic, not only upon their capture, but also following their transfer to places of internment"" both in areas of Russian-controlled Ukraine and Russia itself.

The podcast comes during the ’s 75th anniversary — a time, Burns said, for the agency to ""reflect on how we need to organize ourselves to navigate successfully what is an incredibly complicated international terrain."" Burns warned that terrain features a ""major power competition with rising powers like China,"" which he referred to as a ""central geopolitical challenge."" - '' Director William Burns testifies during a House Intelligence Committee hearing about worldwide threats on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., on April 15, 2021.

""We have to deal with declining powers, not just rising ones, like Russia,"" Burns said. ""And Putin demonstrates every day that declining powers can be at least as disruptive as rising ones."" Burns pointed to Russia’s war in Ukraine and stressed the importance of intelligence. ""We were able to paint a pretty clear picture of Putin’s plans to mount a major new invasion of Ukraine last fall, months before he actually launched that invasion on the 24th of February,"" Burns explained. ""That enabled us to help Ukrainians defend themselves. It helped us to build allied unity.""

2022-09-22,Fox,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/end-near-putin-war-against-ukraine,The end is near for Putin's war against Ukraine,"Fox News senior strategic analyst retired General Jack Keane discusses Putin's most recent threats and the challenges he will face both domestically and abroad given his most recent actions to mobilize 300,000 reserve troops The end is near. For Putin’s military options in Ukraine, that is. Wednesday in Moscow, Putin said he will call up reservists and hold political referenda in captured Ukrainian territory. And yet again, he threatened to use nuclear weapons if Russian territory is in danger. Despite the scary language, Putin is not fooling anybody in . Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg lost no time pointing out that Russia doesn’t have enough weapons to equip more troops. White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby immediately said the speech showed Putin was struggling. And at the , President Biden denounced Putin’s war. Putin’s biggest problem is that Russia is losing and Ukraine has seized the initiative. Ukraine has two counter-offensives underway, in the north and the south. Ukraine scored a major victory by pushing Russian forces out of the town of Izyum two weeks ago, thus keeping control of a major highway and turning back territorial gains in the east. Russian forces broke and fled. The defeat around Izyum also showed that the battlefield performance of Russia’s forces is getting worse, not better. Ukraine is learning and improving while Russia is on the run. ‘ ’ , ‘ ’ Wednesday’s announcement sounded to me like Putin had to do something to rally his own beleaguered military forces and attempt to convince the Russians he still has a plan. But here’s why his words rang hollow. Putin announced a partial call-up of 300,000 Russian reserves. But the mobilization won’t happen overnight, or even over the next few weeks. Simply transporting new troops to the front lines will be difficult for Russia as Ukraine uses long-range weapons to target roads and supply depots. Russia’s military is losing this war despite their superior numbers; so calling for more troops tells you they don’t have a clue how to cope with Ukraine’s tactics and new weapons. I think Putin may be trying to figure out how to sell his defeat. He’ll hold rigged referenda where occupied territories ""vote"" to join Russia. That’s part of his old plan, but it won’t help if Russia keeps losing ground to Ukraine’s forces. The biggest sign of desperation was the renewed nuclear threat. All along, Putin’s nuclear threats have been intended to scare , the U.S. and allies into halting military assistance to Ukraine. He’d like nothing better than to have Washington and London and Berlin and Warsaw cower and cool it on the aid. But the simple fact is that Russia’s threats are not working. As of now, the U.S. military reports that Russian nuclear forces have not changed their posture, according to Kirby. That is a very significant point. It means that Russia is not unwrapping the nuclear weapons and activating units and people to employ them. Of course, the U.S. military has been watching Russia’s nuclear units closely since well before Feb. 24 and the Pentagon says the Russian posture had not changed over the last seven months. So, Putin says he’s ""not bluffing"" but for now his nuclear threats are all just words. It's true that Russia has some rather nasty nukes. However, Putin well knows that use of a Russian nuclear weapon in Ukraine will blow back radiation on Russian forces and into Russia itself, due to prevailing winds. As Biden said, there will also be ""severe consequences"" should Russia use a nuclear weapon. If such a heinous event takes place, there is a full array of legitimate military retaliation options for allies to consider. Just imagine what a U.S. B-2 stealth bomber could do to military targets in Crimea with non-nuclear weapons. For that matter, nuclear powers Britain and France have options, too. Detonating a Russian nuclear weapon will not win the war in Ukraine for Putin. Don’t forget China is already nervous about Russia’s military failures; use of a nuclear weapon by Putin could break up China’s vital energy purchases and isolate Russia even more. The bottom line is that Ukraine’s success is closing off Putin’s options. More troops won’t fix Russia’s almost-insurmountable tactical problems such as poor command and control, an inability to maneuver, no air superiority, and high losses of helicopters and unmanned drones, to name a few. If this is Putin’s next great plan, we are seeing again that Putin is no military genius.",7,4.482916007694832,3.742902592473797,0.7400134152210347,5

""We need to keep the pressure on them,"" Yuriy Sak, adviser to Ukraine’s defense minister, told Fox News Digital. ""If we allow them time to recuperate, if we allow them time to rebuild their capacity, then it will be more possible for them to strike back. ""We need to keep the momentum, and we need to keep going,"" he added, noting that the momentum must also continue to come in the way of international arms if Ukraine is going to be successful. Ukrainian forces have taken back nearly the entire northern region of Kharkiv, liberating more than 400 towns and cities and forcing Russian troops to withdraw. , The advances in Ukraine’s north were part of a long-awaited counteroffensive — first alluded to in mid-May — that also included an offensive push in Ukraine’s southern region. Ukrainian forces are seen in Izyum after Russian forces withdrew from the city in Kharkiv Oblast, Ukraine, on Sept. 16, 2022. But even Kyiv was surprised by its success in Kharkiv, where it managed to take Russian forces by surprise and force them to hastily retreat, in some cases back across Russia’s own borders. ""This was a mission that for a good reason was kept secret for a long time,"" Sak said. ""The outcome of this counteroffensive actually exceeded even our own expectations."" The adviser said it was not only the amount of territory that exceeded Kyiv’s imagination but the success rate of the mission. ‘ ,’ Sak claimed that for every Ukrainian soldier killed in the counteroffensive, somewhere between ""9 to 10"" Russian soldiers were killed. Reports have since surfaced suggesting there was a breakdown in command and control in Russia’s ranks as it withdrew from Kharkiv, prompting its soldiers to abandon not only military equipment but their own troops. Sak said that Ukrainian defense officials had also received word that in an attempt to withdraw faster, Russian troops left behind soldiers killed in action and at times shot their own wounded, though he said these accounts still need to be confirmed. Ukrainian troops retook a wide swath of territory from Russia on Monday, pushing all the way back to the northeastern border in some places, and claimed to have captured many Russian soldiers as part of a lightning advance that forced Moscow to make a hasty retreat. : ""The Ukrainian army has had tremendous success,"" he said. ""They know what they're fighting for. They want to win this war."" But Western officials have said it is too early to say if Ukraine’s ability to recapture some 3,300 square miles is a turning point or whether Russia has another operational ploy up its weathered sleeve. ""We're not fully aware of what they're capable of in this state of desperation — in which they definitely are in now,"" the adviser said. ""We have to be prepared for everything. Again, this brings us back to the issue of haste and speed. ""They are learning from their own mistakes,"" he continued. ""From a purely logical point of view, it is possible to assume that the next stages will be accompanied by a more sophisticated response."" Sak said Ukrainian defense officials are relying heavily on intelligence to determine their offensive strategy and would not guess at what Russia might do next. ""Our plan is simple: to keep fighting until we win this war,"" he added. Ukrainian soldiers sit on infantry fighting vehicles as they advance near Izyum in eastern Ukraine on Sept. 16, 2022. Sak pointed out that as Ukrainian forces were gaining in Kharkiv, Russia increasingly relied on hitting civilian targets and using ""missile terror"" in areas like the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. Ukraine continues to ask for greater air defense like anti-rocket systems, fourth-generation aircraft and longer-range missile systems. But the White House has not yet agreed to these big ticket items. ""We can be as successful as the amount of weapons that we receive,"" he said. ""We understand that this war is far from over.""",7,4.408632519291896,3.188651388501304,1.2199811307905915,26

""This is highly likely due to the recent change in the local security threat level in the face of increased Ukrainian long-range strike capability,"" the defense ministry said. A submarine of the Russian Black Sea fleet anchors on July 27, 2019, in the port city of Sevastopol. ' ' - The move also comes roughly a month after an ammunition depot in Crimea went up in flames after it was targeted in an apparent missile attack, just weeks after at least eight fighter jets were destroyed during the bombardment of Saki airbase, some 140 miles behind the Russian front lines in Crimea. But it remains unclear what long-range strike capabilities Ukraine has or has used as Kyiv has repeatedly called on western allies to supply them with longer-range weaponry like the U.S. Army Tactical Missile System , which has a range of roughly 185 miles. The U.S. has said it will not send over concerns of sparking a third world war. Ukraine has received at least 16 High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems , which have a range of roughly 50 miles – suggesting they could not be the systems used to hit Crimea earlier this year.

The redacted report, from the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, was released Tuesday after two years of independent research conducted by non-partisan Committee staff. : Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Mark Warner, D-Va., speaks to a reporter at the Capitol in Washington, March 16, 2022. The report identified challenges facing the National Counterintelligence and Security Center and offered solutions to ensure that it is better positioned to respond to these foreign intelligence threats. ""The United States faces a dramatically different threat landscape today than it did just a couple of decades ago,"" said Sen. Mark Warner, the Virginia Democrat who chairs the Senate Intelligence Committee, in a statement. ""New threats and new technology mean that we have to make substantial adjustments to our counterintelligence posture if we are going to protect our country's national and economic security.""

The report warned that U.S. adversaries have access to a wider variety of tools for stealing information or inflaming social and political tensions than in past years. The report concluded that U.S. spy agencies' efforts to meet these challenges are hampered by miscommunication and a lack of money and staff at the agency intended to coordinate those efforts. It also recommended that Congress, in conjunction with the Executive Branch and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, develop a consistent U.S. government-wide definition of counterintelligence that reflects today’s landscape. There's also disagreement among intelligence officials about who should lead responses to cyberattacks and campaigns trying to influence Americans — and whether those efforts should be categorized as counterintelligence, the report said. , The Senate report primarily focused on , an element of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. was created in the 2004 reforms following the Sept. 11 attacks and revelations that agencies did not share information about the hijackers involved.

Some 450 bodies have been exhumed from a mass grave in Izyum, a city in the northeast region of Khakriv, a top Ukrainian official told Fox News Digital Saturday. Russian troops withdrew from Kharkiv last week as Ukrainian ground forces made rapid advances and regained the majority of the region’s territory back from Russian troops. But the devastation left in Russia's wake has been akin to atrocities and alleged war crimes witnessed in other regained areas across Ukraine, like Bucha and Irpin. Bags with dead bodies are seen during the exhumation in the recently retaken area of Izyum, Ukraine, Friday, Sept. 16, 2022. - : ""We're discovering new sites of atrocities and renew evidence of war crimes,"" Yuriy Sak advisor to Ukraine’s Defense Minister told Fox News Digital. ""Men, women children. Some of the bodies were dug out with their hands tied behind their backs."" Witnesses of the bodies being exhumed said they depicted signs of having been shot, killed by artillery fire, mines or by airstrikes. ""We are seeing what we have warned about before, that everywhere where the Russian occupiers set their foot they leave disaster, they leave atrocities, they commit war crimes, they terrify and terrorize peaceful populations,"" he added. Sak said a torture chamber was found in the city of Kupiansk, roughly 75 miles north of Izyum, and was allegedly used by Russian forces to terrorize those they suspected of working to thwart Russia’s invasion. Reports on Friday suggested as many as 10 torture chambers had been discovered since Russian troops withdrew. Part of the body of Ukrainian soldier emerges from the ground during an exhumation in the recently retaken area of Izyum, Ukraine, Friday, Sept. 16, 2022. Ukrainian forces since the beginning of September have retaken roughly 3,300 sq miles of territory that was under Russian occupation, but Sak said Ukrainians are not celebrating yet. ""It is absolutely a paralyzing thought trying to imagine what the Ukrainian army will discover when we liberate cities like Mariupol,"" Sak said, referring to the site of one of the most hard-fought battles in Ukraine where hundreds of soldiers and civilians were trapped after Russian troops advanced on the city. ""Absolutely razed to the ground and destroyed and pounded by rockets and bombs for months."" Sak said at least 25,000 civilians were believed to have been killed in the southern port city by the time Ukrainian troops left the city in May following weeks of intense fighting, mounting risk of starvation and an eventual ceasefire. Ukrainian authorities discovered a mass burial site near the recaptured city of Izyum that contained hundreds of graves. ""We understand that this war is far from over. We understand that we are standing up against an enemy which is treacherous, which is genocidal, which is still well-equipped,"" he added. ""We're determined to continue what we're doing.""

""The fact that several municipal deputies in St. Petersburg, Putin’s hometown, came forward accusing [him] of treason and calling for his removal is highly significant,"" Rebekah Koffler, a former intelligence officer and author of ""Putin’s Playbook,"" told Fox News Digital. ""They know the punishment will be severe. They can easily face a death sentence based on Russian federal law. The significance of this act of defiance and dissent by a handful of Russian officials cannot be possibly overstated."" The deputies appealed to the central governing body known as the Duma to punish Putin for countless deaths of military personnel, prompting economic sanctions from other nations, motivating to expand and leading Ukraine to build its military power. 'S Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered Russia’s all-out invasion of Ukraine only eight months after magazine billed President Biden as ready to take on the Russian leader. Their first point is that the president is blamed for the loss of the army, according to Russian newspaper Kommersant. The second problem is the economy.

And Russia has suffered significant losses during its campaign. director William Burns and British intelligence chief Sir Ronald Moore in July said they believed Russia had lost around 15,000 troops, with ""maybe three times"" as many troops wounded. If Ukraine can maintain that momentum, it could revive pressure among officials to take action and change the fortunes of Russia, according to Koffler. , ""It is possible they decided to risk their lives in order to build momentum among the Russian people to oust Putin, which is an incredibly difficult thing to do because Putin has surrounded himself with loyal security and intelligence operatives,"" Koffler explained.

Gorbachev played a role in repairing relations between the Soviet Union and the United States, and his funeral drew thousands of Russians to mourn him despite Putin’s attempt to downplay the significance by ruling out a full state funeral and not even appearing at the funeral himself.

2022-09-09,Fox,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/ukraine-aid-working-russia-invasion-losing-ground,Ukraine aid is working and Russia’s invasion is losing ground,"Fox News correspondent Alex Hogan has the details from Kyiv, Ukraine, on 'America Reports.' It’s official. Ukraine is on the attack, and it’s working. On Thursday, Secretary of State Antony Blinken made a surprise visit to Kyiv promising help ""for as long as it takes"" and announcing $3 billion in aid. Then at the Pentagon, Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark Milley confirmed Ukraine has launched a major counter-offensive in the south. Ukraine’s been out of the headlines this summer, and the sheer mass of Russia’s army and their limitless barbarity stoked fears Russia might be too strong after all. The triple play by Blinken, Austin and Milley reversed all that. Milley described a ""very deliberate offensive attack"" by Ukraine that is ""calibrated to set conditions, and then seize their objectives."" On Day 197, this is no stalemate. Russia and Ukraine are fighting on a curving, 300-mile front with Russia launching a renewed, grinding attack near Bakhmut in the east, while Ukraine pushes its successful counter-offensive centered on Kherson in the south. 30 3 - From what the Pentagon says, Russian President Vladimir Putin is losing, and Russian forces in Ukraine are having ""great difficulty"" with supplies, reinforcements and even basic command and control. Americans can be proud of this. The military training and tactical coaching by America and other allies is paying off on the battlefield for Ukraine. To my eye, there is a now a military plan in place to push Russia back. It took Team Biden a while, but Blinken, Austin and Milley made clear the military operations are in high gear. Ukraine is on the path to victory. A pallet of fuses for 155 mm shells, ultimately bound for Ukraine, is spun as it's loaded on to a C-17 cargo aircraft, April 29, 2022, at Dover Air Force Base, Del. However, there’s a catch. On Sept. 2, the White House asked for another $11.7 billion in aid to get Ukraine to the end of the year. Granted, the money is covering everything from refugee assistance to replenishing U.S. weapons stocks, and of course, major weapons systems for Ukraine like anti-air defense missiles and s precision rocket artillery. That’s on top of $40 billion authorized back in May. That’s a lot of cash. Are you wondering why this fight is worth your tax dollars? I get it. As Americans, we always have qualms about these ""foreign entanglements"" as George Washington called them. And given the mistakes Team Biden made early on, it’s smart to question the plan. Here’s why aid for Ukraine makes sense. First, it’s the reason Ukraine is winning. Austin said Ukraine has ""put to use, good use, the equipment that we've provided them."" Austin and Milley don’t want to say too much yet, but they clearly see Ukraine’s deliberate, precision attacks are choking Russia’s options. Second, Russia has got to lose this war, for so many reasons. Fifteen billion dollars spent so far with billions more to come to defeat Putin’s Russian imperialism is the best investment we Americans can make. Third, military defeat of Russia is essential in our struggle to deter China’s rising military ambitions.

""They will infiltrate the security services,"" Ihor Zvhokva, a top diplomatic aide to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, told Fox News. ""The armed forces, the intelligence community -- you name it -- with the people, with their agents."" The espionage problem has gotten so bad, Zelenskyy recently fired two top officials, including the head of his security services, over their failure to root out the spies. Today, there are hundreds of active investigations. Ihor Zvhovka, a top diplomatic aide to President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says Russian spies infiltrate Ukrainian armed forces and intelligence communities. ""Russia was never, you know, forgetting about this dream for Ukraine to become, again, a part of Russia,"" Zvhokva said. ""In times of war, some of them reveal themselves and some [do] not."" 40 , ' ' ""That's why my president will keep fighting with these Russian agents,"" Zvhokva continued. ""The unlawful acts are causing casualties, unfortunately."" During an interview with Kyiv’s mayor, Vitali Klitschko, the former boxing heavyweight champion of the world warned the problem is massive. ""Everywhere, there’s spies,"" Klitschko said Wednesday. ""They give the target and [coordinate] where the Russians send their rockets."" Mayor Klitschko told Fox News Correspondent Lucas Tomlinson that spies inform Russian military and intelligence of specific coordinates in Ukraine to send missiles. Former boxing heavyweight champ, Vital Klitschko, is now the mayor of Kyiv. Two top officials were recently fired from their government positions for failing to properly vet officials of espionage. Russian espionage is not confined to the capital as suburbs such as Irpin and Bucha have been infiltrated. Vasyl told Fox News Correspondent, Lucas Tomlinson, that elderly people, families, and other unlikely suspects could very likely be spies. On Thursday, six Russian cruise missiles hit just outside of Kyiv for the first time in weeks. ""Everyone right now in Kyiv and Ukraine is under the danger of air attacks,"" Klitschko continued. ""We need modern weapons, defensive weapons… Right now, it's not enough."" The strikes were among more than two dozen launched into Ukraine from Belarus and the Black Sea. Zvhokva accused Russian President Vladimir Putin of ""deliberately"" ordering the massive missile barrage as millions celebrated Statehood Day, a new holiday marking the founding of Kyiv as the capital and the birth of Christianity in Ukraine. In the Kyiv suburb of Irpin, where massive shelling leveled entire neighborhoods during the initial days of the invasion, a local commander who helped repel the Russian advance had a similar warning about Russian espionage. A deputy commander of a local militia says espionage has expanded to the Kyiv suburbs. ""Most of them were in Kyiv. Now they are in Irpin, in Bucha -- in any city,"" Vasyl, a deputy commander of a local militia in Irpin, told Fox News this week. ""They are sabotage teams waiting for Russia's command to harm Ukrainian citizens,"" said Vasyl, who declined to give his last name due to security reasons. ""There are a lot of elderly people and even entire families who don’t seem suspicious at all but are actually saboteurs sending information to the other side."" , When asked if the United States was giving Ukraine enough weapons to defeat the other side, Zelenskyy’s aide Zvhokva told Fox News, ""If we had enough weaponry to defeat Russia, we would have already defeated them."" Rob Lee, a senior fellow at the Foreign Policy Research Institute and a former U.S. Marine infantryman, told Fox News, ""For Ukraine to recapture a sizable amount of territory, short of Russian forces collapsing somewhere along the front, it will need more than just ,"" the satellite-guided rocket launchers recently sent to Ukraine and responsible for destroying 100 high-value Russian targets, a senior Biden administration official recently told reporters. A fisherman watches smoke rise after Russian forces launched a missile attack on a military unit in the Vyshhorod district on the outskirts of Kyiv, Ukraine, Thursday, July 28, 2022. ) ""[Ukraine] needs to have sufficient artillery ammunition to suppress Russian defenses, s to correct artillery, sufficient tanks and armored vehicles, and a large enough ground force with well-trained professional units not just volunteers,"" Lee added. Zvhokva’s goal is to defeat Russia completely and get them out of all of Ukraine, not back to where they were on Feb. 23rd before the invasion or even in 2014 following the annexation of Crimea. He wants Ukraine’s borders restored to where they were on Aug. 24, 1991, the day it declared its independence from the Soviet Union. When asked what message he wanted to send back to Americans, Zvhokva replied, ""Are you ready to sacrifice some part of your cozy life in order for evil not to win?"" ""If this evil will not be stopped here in Ukraine, it will spread further,"" said Zvhorkva. ""Don't pretend you can hide.""",47,3.3550667067704674,3.2318873364944154,0.12317937027605197,12
2022-07-28,Fox,https://www.foxnews.com/world/how-russia-spread-secret-web-agents-across-ukraine,How Russia spread a secret web of agents across Ukraine,"When the first armoured vehicles of Russia's invading army reached the heart of Chornobyl nuclear plant on the afternoon of Feb. 24, they encountered a Ukrainian unit charged with defending the notorious facility. In less than two hours, and without a fight, the 169 members of the Ukrainian National Guard laid down their weapons. Russia had taken Chornobyl, a repository for tonnes of nuclear material and a key staging post on the approach to Kyiv. The fall of Chornobyl, site of the world's worst nuclear disaster, stands out as an anomaly in the five-month old war: a successful blitzkrieg operation in a conflict marked elsewhere by a brutal and halting advance by Russian troops and grinding resistance by Ukraine. Now a Reuters investigation has found that Russia's success at Chornobyl was no accident, but part of a long-standing Kremlin operation to infiltrate the Ukrainian state with secret agents. Vladimir President Vladimir Putin ordered Russia’s all-out invasion of Ukraine only eight months after magazine billed President Biden as ready to take on the Russian leader. - : '' Five people with knowledge of the Kremlin's preparations said war planners around President Vladimir Putin believed that, aided by these agents, Russia would require only a small military force and a few days to force Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's administration to quit, flee or capitulate. Through interviews with dozens of officials in Russia and Ukraine and a review of Ukrainian court documents and statements to investigators, related to a probe into the conduct of people who worked at Chornobyl, Reuters has established that this infiltration reached far deeper than has been publicly acknowledged. The officials interviewed include people inside Russia who were briefed on Moscow's invasion planning and Ukrainian investigators tasked with tracking down spies. ""Apart from the external enemy, we unfortunately have an internal enemy, and this enemy is no less dangerous,"" the secretary of Ukraine's National Security and Defence Council, Oleksiy Danilov, said in an interview. At the time of the invasion, Danilov said, Russia had agents in the Ukrainian defence, security and law enforcement sectors. He declined to give names but said such traitors needed to be ""neutralised"" at all costs. Ukraine's State Bureau of Investigation is conducting a probe into whether the National Guard acted unlawfully by surrendering its weapons to an enemy, a local official told Reuters. The State Bureau of Investigation didn't comment. The National Guard defended the actions of its unit at the plant, pointing to the risks of conflict at a nuclear site. Troops march during a rehearsal for the Victory Day military parade which will take place at Dvortsovaya Square on May 9 to celebrate 77 years after the victory in World War in St. Petersburg, Russia, Thursday, May 5, 2022. Court documents and testimony, reported here for the first time, reveal the role played by Chornobyl's head of security, Valentin Viter, who is in detention and is being investigated for absenting himself from his post. An extract from the state register of pre-trial investigations, seen by Reuters, shows Viter is also suspected of treason, an allegation his lawyer says is unfounded. In a statement to investigators, Viter said that on the day of the invasion he spoke by phone with the National Guard unit commander. Viter advised the commander not to endanger his unit, telling him: ""Spare your people."" One source with direct knowledge of the Kremlin's invasion plans told Reuters that Russian agents were deployed to Chornobyl last year to bribe officials and prepare the ground for a bloodless takeover. Reuters couldn't independently verify the details of this assertion. However, Ukraine's State Bureau of Investigation has said it is investigating a former top intelligence official, Andriy Naumov, on suspicion of treason for passing Chornobyl security secrets to a foreign state. A lawyer for Naumov declined to comment. At a national level, sources with knowledge of the Kremlin's plans said Moscow was counting on activating sleeper agents inside the Ukrainian security apparatus. The sources confirmed Western intelligence reports that the Kremlin was lining up Oleg Tsaryov, a hotelier, to lead a puppet government in Kyiv. And a former Ukrainian prosecutor general disclosed to Reuters in June that Ukrainian politician Viktor Medvedchuk, a friend of Putin, had an encrypted phone issued by Russia so he could communicate with the Kremlin. Tsaryov said the Reuters account of how Moscow's operation overall unfolded ""has very little to do with reality."" He did not address his relationship with the Kremlin. A lawyer for Medvedchuk declined to comment. Medvedchuk is in a Ukrainian jail awaiting trial on treason charges that pre-date the Russian invasion. - Syrian Foreign Minister Faisal Mekdad, right, meets with Russian lawmaker Dmitry Sablin, who visits Syria as part of a large Russian delegation that includes the foreign minister for the breakaway pro-Russian area in Ukraine, the so-called ""Donetsk People's Republic"", in Damascus, Syria, Tuesday, June 14, 2022. Syria said Wednesday, July 20, 2022, that it is formally breaking diplomatic ties with Ukraine in response to a similar move by Kyiv. Syria is a strong ally of Russia, which joined Syria’s conflict in September 2015 in favor of President Bashar Assad. ) Though Russia captured Chornobyl, its plan to take power in Kyiv failed. In many cases, the sleeper agents Moscow had installed failed to do their job, according to multiple sources in Russia and Ukraine. Ukraine Security Council Secretary Danilov said the agents and their handlers believed Ukraine was weak, which was ""a total misconception."" People the Kremlin counted on as its proxies in Ukraine overstated their influence in the years leading up to the invasion, said four of the sources with knowledge of the Kremlin's preparations. The Kremlin relied in its planning on ""clowns – they know a little bit, but they always say what the leadership wants to hear because otherwise they won't get paid,"" said one of the four, a person close to the Moscow-backed separatist leadership in eastern Ukraine. Putin now finds himself in a protracted, full-scale war, fighting for every inch of territory at huge cost. , : 'S A ' ' But the Russian intelligence infiltration did succeed in one way: It has sown mistrust inside Ukraine and laid bare the shortcomings of Ukraine's near 30,000-strong Security Service of Ukraine, or , which shares a complicated history with Russia, and is now tasked with hunting down traitors and collaborators. This internal Ukrainian turmoil burst into partial view on July 17. In a video address to the nation, President Zelenskyy suspended head Ivan Bakanov, whom he has known for years, citing the large number of staff suspected of treason. Ukrainian law enforcement sources told Reuters that some staff recounted in conversation with them that they were unable to reach Bakanov for several days after Russia invaded, adding to a sense of chaos in Kyiv. Bakanov didn't respond to Reuters' requests for comment. Zelenskyy also said 651 cases of alleged treason and collaboration have been opened against individuals involved in law enforcement and in the prosecutor's office. More than 60 officials from the and the prosecutor general's office are working against Ukraine in Russian-occupied zones, Zelenskyy added. Asked to comment on Reuters' findings, the Ukrainian presidential administration, the and the prosecutor general's office did not respond. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said: ""All these questions have no relation whatsoever to us, therefore there is nothing for us to comment on here."" The Russian intelligence agency, the , and the defence ministry did not respond to Reuters' questions. Moscow's spy apparatus has been intertwined with Chornobyl for decades. After the 1986 disaster, when a reactor blew up scattering radioactive clouds across Europe, the Soviet stepped in. More than 1,000 staff took part in the clean-up, according to a declassified internal memo to a Ukrainian government minister, dated 1991. Then- boss Viktor Chebrikov ordered his officers to recruit agents among the plant's staff and instructed that a officer should hold the post of deputy boss of the plant in charge of security, according to another memo - an internal communication from 1986. Even after Ukraine became independent in 1991, Moscow's spy chiefs remained powerful there. The first head of Ukraine's domestic intelligence service was Nikolai Golushko, who started his career in Soviet Russia. Before his appointment he led the Ukraine arm of the Soviet . Golushko kept most of the Soviet-era officers in their jobs, he wrote in a 2012 memoir. Consulate employees remove the U.S flag at the U.S. consulate in St.Petersburg, Russia. After four months as Ukraine's spy chief, Golushko moved back to Moscow to rejoin headquarters, and in 1993 became head of Russia's newly created Federal Counter-Intelligence Service, precursor to today's . In Moscow, Golushko received a visit from the deputy head of Ukraine's State Security Service, Golushko wrote in the memoir. He recalled how Oleg Pugach, the Ukrainian official, asked for Golushko's help finding fabric to make the uniforms for Ukraine's intelligence officers. Golushko also wrote that Kyiv, short of its own resources and expertise, signed deals under which the agreed to share intelligence information with Moscow. In exchange, Moscow provided supplies, technology and expert help with investigations. Reuters approached Golushko for comment. A colleague from an intelligence veterans' group told Reuters Golushko, now 85, was in ill health and could not answer questions. Reuters was unable to reach Pugach and couldn't independently confirm Golushko's account. Intelligence officers working at Chornobyl officially became part of Ukraine's security apparatus in 1991, but they continued to take orders from Moscow, said the person with direct knowledge of the invasion plan. ""In effect, these were employees,"" said the person. The did not respond to questions about Chornobyl or historical ties to Russian intelligence. The Chornobyl nuclear plant is a vast facility. A giant steel structure encases Reactor No. 4, ground zero of the 1986 disaster. The plant lies just 10 kilometres at the closest point from the border with Belarus, in a dense and highly irradiated forest. Russia's war planners considered control of Chornobyl to be strategically important because it sat on the shortest route for their advance on Kyiv, according to Western military analysts. ' ' The source with direct knowledge of the invasion plan said that in November 2021 Russia started sending undercover intelligence agents to Ukraine, tasked with establishing contacts with officials responsible for securing the Chornobyl power plant. The agents' goal was to ensure there would be no armed resistance once Russian troops rolled in. The source said Chornobyl also served as a drop-off point for documents from headquarters. In return for payment, Ukrainian officials handed Russian spies information about Ukraine's military readiness. Reuters could not independently verify details of the source's account, and neither Ukraine's State Bureau of Investigation nor the responded to the news agency's questions. But a review of Ukrainian testimony and court documents and an interview with a local official show that Kyiv is conducting at least three investigations into the conduct of people who worked at Chornobyl. The investigations have identified at least two people suspected of providing information to Russian agents or otherwise helping them seize the plant, according to these documents. A New Safe Confinement structure over the old sarcophagus covering the damaged fourth reactor at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant is seen behind the abandoned town of Pripyat, Ukraine. Workers at the plant said Russian soldiers disturbed radioactive dust and failed to wear protective gear after taking control of the site. One of the men suspected by Ukrainian prosecutors and investigators of helping Russian forces is Valentin Viter, a 47-year-old colonel in the . At the time of the Russian invasion, Viter was the deputy general-director of the plant responsible for its physical protection. In May last year, Viter oversaw a routine training exercise that was meant to simulate an attack by armed saboteurs. Armed members of the National Guard unit that protects Chornobyl took part, and rehearsed repelling the attackers by force. Viter said the exercise was a success, according to a video interview posted shortly afterwards on the plant's website. He also said he hoped Chornobyl's security team would ""not need to apply the knowledge and skills we acquired in a real-life situation."" Viter was seconded from the to work at Chornobyl as security chief in mid-2019, according to a statement he gave to investigators. In a further statement, he said that on Feb. 18 this year – six days before the Russian invasion – he went on sick leave with a respiratory problem. By then, Russia was bolstering its troops in Belarus in preparation for an invasion, U.S. officials said at the time. Satellite images shot by U.S. satellite imagery company Maxar on Feb. 15 showed a military pontoon bridge under construction across the Pripyat River in Belarus, north of the power plant. Ukraine's police, and the , were on heightened alert in response to the Russian threat, and the national police chief said in a statement at the time that security was reinforced at the Chornobyl plant. On the morning of the Russian invasion, Feb. 24, Viter said, in a statement to investigators, that he was at his home in Kyiv. He telephoned the head of the Chornobyl National Guard unit, who was at his post. By then, people at the plant knew a column of Russian armoured vehicles was heading their way. A view of an abandoned city of Pripyat in Chernobyl, Ukraine, on 25 December, 2019. The Chernobyl disaster on the Chernobyl nuclear power plant occurred on April 26, 1986. Viter, according to his testimony to Ukrainian investigators, told the commander, in Russian: ""Spare your people."" Viter had no official authority over the National Guard, and Reuters could not determine whether the commander was heeding Viter's words when the unit surrendered after discussions with the Russian invaders. A National Guard statement identified the unit commander as Yuriy Pindak. When the Russian soldiers finally retreated from Chornobyl after a 36-day occupation, they took Pindak and most of his unit away as captives. Ukraine says the guards are being held in Russia or Belarus. Russian officials did not comment on the unit's whereabouts. Ukraine's State Bureau of Investigation is conducting a probe into whether the National Guard broke the law by laying down arms, said Yuriy Fomichev, mayor of the town of Slavutych where most of the Chornobyl workers live. Fomichev said he was not aware of anyone having been charged. The State Bureau of Investigation didn't respond to Reuters' questions about the matter. The National Guard declined to comment on the actions of individual commanders and members of the unit tasked with protecting Chornobyl. ""Fighting on the territory of nuclear facilities is prohibited by the Geneva Convention,"" it said, adding that this was ""one of the reasons"" why there was no heavy fighting at the site. It referred questions about any investigation to the Bureau. Article 56 of an additional protocol to the Geneva Conventions states that nuclear power plants and other dangerous installations should not be attacked. , Viter was arrested in western Ukraine and is now in pre-trial detention there on suspicion of absenting himself from his post. An extract from the court's register, seen by Reuters, shows that law enforcement agents have initiated a second investigation into Viter for suspected treason by ""deliberately assisting the military units of the aggressor country, the Russian Federation, in carrying out subversive activities against Ukraine."" They have yet to uncover evidence tying him to Russian special services. Viter has said in court statements that he fled Kyiv for the safety of his family two days after Chornobyl was seized but tried to stay in contact with colleagues at the plant. His lawyer, Oleksandr Kovalenko, said Viter had a legitimate reason for being off work and was unaware that he should stay at Chornobyl. The lawyer said any treason allegation was unfounded and Viter had not been served with a letter of suspicion, a step which usually precedes charges. According to the lawyer, Viter said ""Spare your people"" to remind the National Guard commander that many people depended on him. Viter did not discuss surrender, Kovalenko said. He added that investigators had not asked Viter about any exchange of documents at Chornobyl. The extent to which Russia infiltrated Chornobyl has focused Ukrainian authorities' attention on the , the agency Viter worked for, sources said. In particular, military prosecutors on Viter's case are interested in his connection to a former Ukrainian official called Andriy Naumov, according to sources with knowledge of the investigation and a transcript of Viter's questioning seen by Reuters. Russian Foreign Intelligence Service Director Sergei Naryshkin is seen while opening of the exhibition on violations of human rights in Ukraine , on January 18, 2022 in Moscow, Russia. Naryshkin reportedly said that state terror in Ukraine can be compared with times of Hitler in Nazi Germany. Previously an official in the Ukrainian prosecutor's office, by 2018 Naumov had been appointed head of , a state enterprise responsible for estate-management of the radioactive exclusion zone around Chornobyl. A major part of 's role was to promote ""extreme tourism"" in the exclusion zone, but the enterprise also had a role in keeping the site secure, according to its website. After his stint at Chornobyl, Naumov was made the head of the 's department of internal security, a division that investigates other officers suspected of criminal activity. Last year, the agency said it thwarted an assassination attempt on Naumov by other officers. Naumov was later fired as department chief, according to Ukrainian media outlet Ukrainska Pravda and a law enforcement source. Naumov vanished shortly before the invasion, a person in law enforcement said. He eventually turned up in Serbia in June. A Serbian police statement issued on June 8 said police and anti-corruption agents had arrested a Ukrainian citizen identified by the initials ""A.N."" on the border with North Macedonia. He had been trying to cross into North Macedonia from Serbia. A search of the in which he was a passenger uncovered $124,924 and 607,990 euros in cash, plus two emeralds, the statement said. It said the individual and the unnamed driver of the , who was also detained, were suspected of intending to launder the cash and emeralds, which police believe originated from criminal activities. Volodymyr Tolkach, Ukraine's ambassador to Serbia, publicly confirmed the arrested man was Naumov. : - The State Bureau of Investigation confirmed a local media report that it is conducting a pre-trial investigation into Naumov for state treason. It said it was looking into whether Naumov collected information on the security set-up at Chornobyl while working at the plant and later at the and passed it to a foreign state. The statement did not say what grounds it had for suspecting he passed on secrets or if it had specific evidence linking him to Russia. On March 31, President Zelenskyy issued a decree stripping Naumov of his brigadier-general rank. The same day, the Ukrainian president announced in an emotional address that Naumov and another general were ""traitors"" who violated their oath of allegiance to Ukraine. Zelenskyy did not make reference to Chornobyl. Naumov remains in detention in Serbia and could not be reached for comment. His lawyer in Serbia, Viktor Gostiljac, declined to comment. The did not reply to questions about Naumov. Ukainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy stands in the town of Bucha, northwest of the Ukrainian capital Kyiv, on April 4, 2022. - Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky said on April 3, 2022 the Russian leadership was responsible for civilian killings in Bucha, outside Kyiv, where bodies were found lying in the street after the town was retaken by the Ukrainian army. For Russia's war planners, seizing Chornobyl was just a stepping stone to the main objective: taking control of the Ukrainian national government in Kyiv. There, too, the Kremlin expected that undercover agents in positions of power would play a crucial part, according to four sources with knowledge of the plan. Yuriy Lutsenko, who served as Ukraine's prosecutor general from 2016 until 2019, revealed to Reuters that at the time he left the role ""hundreds"" of Defence Ministry employees were under surveillance, approved by his office, because they were suspected of ties to the Russian state. Lutsenko said he believed there were similar numbers of suspected spies in other ministries. Russia's war planners were also counting on other allies to help in the takeover, five sources said. One of the most visible loyalists was Viktor Medvedchuk, a leader of Ukraine's Opposition Platform – For Life party. Putin is god-father to one of Medvedchuk's children. Since 2014, Medvedchuk has been a vocal opponent of the popular protests that called for closer ties to the European Union. 10 Medvedchuk was charged with state treason on May 11, 2021. Investigators from the alleged at the time that Medvedchuk passed secret details about Ukrainian military units to Russian officials, and intended to recruit Ukrainian agents and covertly influence Ukrainian politics. The day before the invasion, he left his home in Kyiv and was planning on leaving the country, in violation of the terms of his bail, according to the . Medvedchuk was detained on April 12, Zelenskyy announced that day. Zelenskyy immediately posted pictures of him handcuffed, in Ukrainian military fatigues and looking bedraggled. Medvedchuk has since been in detention. Medvedchuk has denied the treason charges, saying they were falsified and part of a political plot against him. Kremlin spokesman Peskov told reporters on April 13 Medvedchuk had no back-channel communication with the Russian leadership. A Russian serviceman walks while guarding an area of the Mariupol Sea Port in Mariupol, in territory under the government of the Donetsk People's Republic, eastern Ukraine. Lutsenko, the former Ukraine prosecutor general, told Reuters that before the Russian invasion, Medvedchuk used an encrypted telephone that was issued to him by the Kremlin, equipment reserved only for the most senior Russian officials and pro-Russian separatist leaders. Lutsenko said Ukrainian investigators had managed to hack the encrypted phone system, without disclosing what they found. Medvedchuk's lawyer, Tetyana Zhukovska, declined to comment until a court has handed down a decision in the case. The Ukrainian prosecutor's office did not comment. Another key figure, according to three sources familiar with the Russian plans, was Oleg Tsaryov, a square-jawed 52-year-old former member of Ukraine's parliament. He was picked by Kremlin invasion planners to lead the new interim government they planned to install, these sources said. Their comments are the first confirmation from within Russia of U.S. intelligence assessments, reported by the Financial Times earlier this year, that Moscow was considering putting Tsaryov in a leadership role in a puppet government in Kyiv. Tsaryov has been under Ukrainian and U.S. sanctions since 2014, when, after a bid to win election as Ukrainian president collapsed, he headed up a body called ""Novorossiya,"" or New Russia. The group pushed the idea of turning southeastern Ukraine into a separate pro-Russian statelet. By the start of this year, he was in Russian-annexed Crimea, where he owns two hotels. In the early hours of Feb. 24, at the start of the invasion, Tsaryov told his more than 200,000 Telegram followers he had crossed into Kyiv-controlled territory. ""I'm in Ukraine. Kyiv will be free from fascists."" But Zelenskyy did not capitulate. Any expectations in Moscow that he would flee Kyiv or negotiate a deal that would cede to Russia's demands soon evaporated. In the weeks that followed, Ukrainian forces halted Russian troops' advance on Kyiv. Tsaryov never made it to the capital. On June 10, he posted an advertisement to his Telegram followers for his seaside hotel in Crimea, where a one-night stay costs 1,500 roubles per person per night. Tsaryov is now spending his time in Crimea with visits to Moscow, according to his social media posts. Russia's campaign of infiltration did, however, stir suspicion and mistrust at some levels of the Ukrainian state, which hampered its ability to govern, especially in the first few days after the invasion. Service members take part in a military parade on Victory Day, which marks the 77th anniversary of the victory over Nazi Germany in World War , in the Chechen capital Grozny, Russia May 9, 2022. /Chingis Kondarov One stark incident that fuelled the tensions in Kyiv's power corridors related to the death in early March of Denys Kirieiev, a former bank executive, several sources said. He was a member of the Ukrainian delegation that took part in short-lived talks with Russian negotiators on the Ukraine-Belarus border, starting on Feb. 28. A photograph showed Kirieiev sitting alongside Ukrainian officials at the negotiating table. An advisor to the Zelenskyy administration said, in an online interview, that officers from the shot Kirieiev while trying to arrest him as a Russian spy. But Ukraine's Military Intelligence Agency said Kirieiev was its employee and intelligence officer, and that he died a hero while conducting an unspecified special assignment defending Ukraine. A source close to the Ukrainian military told Reuters that Kirieiev was indeed a spy working for Ukraine. He had access to the highest levels of the Russian leadership, this source said, and was feeding back valuable information on invasion plans and other matters to his handlers in Kyiv. Amid the chaos early in the war, Bakanov, then the head of the , left Kyiv for at least three days after the Russian invasion, according to three people in Ukrainian law enforcement. Two of these people said some staff recounted they were unable to reach Bakanov for several days after Russia invaded. In suspending Bakanov on July 17, Zelenskyy cited an article in Ukraine's Armed Forces statute, under which servicemen can be relieved of their duties for improper conduct leading to casualties or a threat of casualties. Bakanov and the did not respond to Reuters' questions. Zelenskyy, in his speech, stressed the toll Russian infiltration was taking on his embattled country by speaking of the numerous officials who have been accused of betraying Ukraine.",20,3.103546244985845,4.321405171908269,-1.2178589269224243,27

Ukrainian troops are finally seeing a boost to their war effort as the impact of U.S.-supplied High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems have successfully stalled Russian forces on the front lines, Yuriy Sak advisor to Ukraine’s Defense Minister told Fox News Digital. ""They have not progressed anywhere during the last two weeks,"" Sak said in an exclusive interview. ""Their offensive is pretty much stalled at the moment. The conclusion is that they are not able to beat Ukrainian armed forces in the conventional warfare."" Russia has depended heavily on artillery strikes throughout the war, but Moscow’s stalled abilities to push forward with ground forces has prompted a greater reliance on missile strikes in civilian areas. Ukrainian soldiers are sitting at the shelling scene of a destroyed school in Kramatorsk, Donetsk, Ukraine. As Russia stepped up its ""military operation"" in Ukraine, a school in Kramatorsk was hit and destroyed by Russian rockets on July 21, 2022. , ""We've managed to slow them down on the front line, we have managed to stabilize the front line. But at the same time, they are still shooting missiles at cities across Ukraine,"" the defense official explained. ""This is why they resort to the tactics of terror."" However, Sak said Moscow’s heavy reliance on artillery, and its inability to effectively advance ground forces has given Kyiv an effective operational strategy to repel Russian troops. The has become top dog in Ukraine’s defensive posture because it has enabled Ukrainian forces to hit Russia where it hurts the most – its eastern and southern ammunitions depots. The M142 has proven particularly effective given its range of roughly 50 miles. The missile system is reportedly more effective than previous artillery deployed to Ukraine, and as it is essentially a rocket system mounted to the back of a truck, its high mobility makes it more difficult for opposing forces to target. The U.S. has so far pledged to send at least 20 to Kyiv. ""We are very thankful to the U.S. government to the U.S. people for their unprecedented support. I'm telling you this sincerely from the bottom of my heart,"" Sak said. ""Small children in Ukraine, without exception, know the word now. ""They will start calling their kittens and puppies ,"" he added in a stark reminder of how deeply every Ukrainian has been affected by the war. A launch truck fires the High Mobility Artillery Rocket System produced by Lockheed Martin during combat training May 23, 2011, in the high desert of the Yakima Training Center, Wash.

It's a distance which is almost the length of the U.S.-Mexico border,"" he explained for context. Sak argued that Ukraine needs longer range missile capabilities, like the Army Tactical Missile System which has a range of roughly 185 miles. The longer range of fire would allow Ukrainian forces to more effectively launch counter-offensives against Russia. However, White House National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said speaking from the Aspen Security Forum Friday that President Biden is not yet prepared to supply Ukraine with certain missile systems. ""One of them are long-range missiles, , which have a range of 300 km,"" explained Sullivan. ""He does believe that while the key goal of the United States is to do the needful to support and defend Ukraine, another key goal is to ensure that we do not end up in a circumstance where we are heading down the road towards a third World War,"" he added. Ukrainian servicemen fire a towed howitzer in eastern Ukraine July 18, 2022. ) However, Sak pushed back on this line of reasoning and argued Kyiv has made it clear that it has no intention to strike targets within Russia’s internationally recognized borders. ""We just want to de-occupy our land, and we want to be able to defend our people,"" he told Fox News Digital with the aid of the Ukraine Frontline Media Platform, who helped facilitate the interview with the official. The defense official said Ukraine needs more than just advanced missile systems to counter Russian forces. Defense systems, armored vehicles, tanks and modern combat aircraft are essential if Kyiv wants to liberate its occupied territories. The defense ministry has broken down its strategy across Ukraine into three different operational objectives, including stabilizing the eastern front with the goal of liberating the temporarily occupied territories. The second component is the ""gradual liberation"" of the occupied areas in southern Ukraine and finally, preserving the security of the northern border. ""We understand that we cannot sacrifice one of these components and gamble and hope that nothing will happen. We have always been prepared for any turn of events because we know that we are facing a very unpredictable and deranged enemy,"" Sak said.

""This will be like a time bomb. This will just give Russia time to regroup, to rearm and then strike again.

Since invading Ukraine, Russia has upped their cyberattacks on the United States and its allies, according to a report from Microsoft, and there are several lessons to help protect against these attacks in the future, Microsoft President and vice-Chair Brad Smith told Fox News Digital. A drastic cyberattack against the United States is not a far-reaching idea. In fact, according to the report ""Defending Ukraine: Early Lessons from the Cyber War,"" Microsoft has tracked Russian cyber hacking in 42 countries, with the United States being the top target, followed by Poland. ""I would say the number one goal of the Russians appears to be to get access to information so they know what governments are planning to do, it’s sort of classic espionage,"" Smith told Fox News Digital at the Aspen Security Forum. The war in Ukraine, while brutal on the ground, shows that Russia is a major cyber threat as well, Smith said, noting that the country has used their cyber capabilities in three ways. 5 ' Microsoft Corp. logo outside the Microsoft Visitor Center in Redmond, Wash. ""First, with destructive cyberattacks,"" he said. ""If they are trying to take over a nuclear power plant, they also try to take over the network, say the day before they have the troops outside. The second prominent way Russia has been using its cyber capabilities is ""espionage outside of Ukraine,"" Smith said, referencing more than 120 efforts in just the first few months of the war to infiltrate Microsoft customers, primarily governments. ""The third thing is what we call cyber influence operations,"" he added. ""This is really an effort to put out propaganda to support the Russian war aims."" , : Smith said Microsoft has tracked an 82% increase of Russian propaganda in the United States, and a 216% increase in Ukraine. Russia President Vladimir Putin. One lesson, according to the report, is that countries should distribute digital operations and data sets across geographies. ""It’s sort of a classic lesson from military history,"" Smith said. ""When German bombers were dropping bombs on London, the British moved their communications infrastructure underground. Today, a data center can be taken out by a cruise missile, and that, in fact, is part of what the Ukrainians experienced."" Smith also highlighted the importance of public-private partnerships when dealing with cyberspace, in contrast to traditional warfare which took place on land, sea and air. 85% : A pallet of fuses for 155 mm shells, ultimately bound for Ukraine, is spun as it's loaded on to a C-17 cargo aircraft, April 29, 2022, at Dover Air Force Base, Del.

""It may be a data center, it may be a cable that belongs to a company like Microsoft or someone else. Ultimately, it includes everybody’s laptops. It includes the phone in someone’s hand."" ""And so, the only way to really defend against attacks in cyberspace is … to bring everybody together. We need to bring together governments and tech companies and other businesses and nonprofits and s. Only then can we do collectively what it takes to really ensure security in cyberspace,"" he continued.",20,4.20304704822399,3.594647075124369,0.6083999730996208,13

Michael Waller shares insight on 'America's News .' America must work with rival nations to develop international norms for developing technologies such artificial intelligence or face increasingly difficult challenges in tackling misinformation and cyberwarfare, experts have said. ""I like to think of this as sort of where things were 20 years ago in tech, where we were incredibly naïve,"" said Eric Schmidt, former Google and current Chairman of the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence, said Friday at the Aspen Security Forum. ""I was very naive about the impact of what we were doing. I now understand that information is everything: It's incredibly powerful."" Much of the security forum focused on various challenges the United States and western allies face at the international level from rival nations Russia, China and Iran. ""When we talk about information operations, we usually say the Russians are the most prolific, the Chinese are the most sophisticated, and the Iranians are the most angry,"" Brad Smith, of Microsoft, said. ""Most of their anger is not directed at the United States, but it is directed at American allies."" ‘ ’ 'S ; ‘’T ' - The three nations mainly make headlines regarding their more obvious military aggressions against neighboring countries – Russia’s invasion of Ukraine; China’s posturing on a possible Taiwan invasion; and Iran supporting Houthi activities in various Middle Eastern countries. But cybersecurity experts have tried to draw more attention to the arena of cyberwarfare, including both the use of misinformation and the development of technology to improve weapons and information technology. Microsoft President Brad Smith speaks during a Reuters Newsmaker event in New York, U.S., September 13, 2019. ""So I think the first comment I would make is I think that the government and other institutions should put more pressure on tech to get these things consistent with our values and so forth,"" he continued. ""I suspect we all agree - we can debate how to do it, but it requires a conversation; it requires engagement."" Schmidt specifically highlighted the complications surrounding negotiations of a possible A.I. agreement between countries: He argued that finding common ground between China and the U.S. would likely prove more challenging than people realize despite the apparent importance and need for such agreements. ‘ ’ , ‘’ ""How would we do it?"" he asked of the Chinese side. ""Who do we call? I’ve tried to find that person and I can’t find them. We’re not ready for the negotiations we need."" He likened artificial intelligence to nuclear weapons, with the latter showing that rival nations can come to an agreement on procedures and systems regarding vital and dangerous assets. , - 16: Eric Schmidt, former chairman and at visits Fox Business Network Studios on April 16, 2019 in New York City. Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va. and Chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, noted that America did create the problem in the 1990s by walking away from efforts to create an international norm for cyber rules. ""I get it because there are still folks in our government, I have some sympathy for this,"" he explained. ""Say we adhere to cyber norms and the bad guys won't - I think we at least ought to have a debate about, say, if you bring down a health care system: Should there be a lower attribution rule in terms of going after the actors than if you're taking down something else?"" ‘ ’ : Smith agreed, urging the U.S. to find ways to develop ""stronger norms"" for cyberspace. - This Wednesday July 25, 2018 file photo shows Sen.

""The truth is, there's never been a rule that wasn't violated by somebody. That's why we have police forces and courts."" But rules alone will not limit the possibilities and uses of such technologies: The development of the physical hardware must take priority as well, according to Warner.

The White House continues to provide assistance to ensure the safety of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s safety even as the Russian invasion has focused in the eastern region of the country, a security official revealed. ""It’s not something to make light of because President Zelenskyy's personal safety is something that that concerns us,"" Jake Sullivan, the White House National Security Advisor, said Friday during the Aspen Security Forum. ""This is a leader in wartime dealing with an opponent, an adversary, an enemy in Russia that is ruthless, brutal and capable of just about anything, so it is a concern,"" he continued. ""President Zelenskyy takes the precautions you would expect to protect himself, to protect continuity of government in Ukraine, and we are trying to help and facilitate that in any way that we can."" Zelenskyy allegedly survived at least three assassination attempts by Russian troops in the early weeks of the invasion. The Times of London reported that he was able to avoid these attempts because Russian individuals fed intelligence to Ukrainian government officials. , : The report stated that the Wagner Group, a Russian backed paramilitary mercenary force, was behind two of the attempts which would presumably allow Russia to deny involvement if the group was successful in killing Zelenskyy. In a move supported by U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, the European Union in December moved to sanction the Russia-backed Wagner Group and its associates for serious human rights abuses, including torture and extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions and killings, and destabilizing activities in countries including Libya, Syria, the Central African Republic and Ukraine’s Donbas region. National security adviser Jake Sullivan speaks during a press briefing at the White House, Tuesday, March 22, 2022, in Washington. The failure to kill Zelenskyy ranks among the greatest shortcomings during Russia’s invasion, according to British spy chief Richard Moore. ""We had the enormous privilege in the U.S. and U.K. intelligence services of knowing what [Putin’s] plan was, and he had three things he wanted,"" Moore said. ""One was to remove [President Volodymyr] Zelenskyy, second was to capture Kiev, and third was to sow disunity within the alliance."" ‘ ’ 'S ; ‘’T ' - ""If you turn to those three briefly … I think that's a fail, if you completely failed to capture Kyiv."" That, he said, means Russia suffered a ""very, very bloody nose."" Sullivan acknowledged that the American intelligence community misjudged Russia, claiming that assessments before the war indicated that Russia would be ""significantly more capable and … more successful on the battlefield."" In this photo provided by the Ukrainian Presidential Press Office on Saturday, June 18, 2022, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy attends a meeting with military officials as he visits the war-hit Mykolaiv region. ""Russia was not able to achieve the basic strategic objectives that President Putin set out, which were to seize the capital city of Kiev and to end Ukraine as a going concern,"" Sullivan said. ""Instead, the Ukrainians won the battle of Kiev; they beat Russia back from Kharkiv; they stopped Russia from being able to make bombs rush to Odessa, and they essentially stymied the Russian effort to get beyond a swath of territory in the south and east of the country."" ""Now we're in a circumstance in which Russia is facing significant difficulties, constituting the kind of force necessary for them to achieve the objectives which have not fundamentally changed,"" he added. Both Moore and Director William Burns revealed this week that U.S. and British intelligence estimates would suggest that Russia has lost at least 15,000 troops since the start of the invasion almost five months ago: That would equal the total number of Russian troops that died in the decade-long Afghanistan war effort in the 1980s.

Col. Darin Gaub joins 'Fox News Live' with analysis on U.S. aid to Ukraine. Recent developments have made it easier than ever to acquire military grade drones, and the U.S. needs to focus on developing counter-drone measures, experts said Friday at the Aspen Security Forum in Aspen, Colorado. ""We do see this as a growing problem, because if you look at the availability of inexpensive drones, you find that the violent extremist organizations that we battle around the globe have easy access to this technology,"" Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, and Ranking Member on the Senate Armed Services Committee, said. ""They don't need to develop anything. All they need to do is hop on Amazon, and they can buy a $300 drone that can be used against an adversary. And so it is a real concern."" Ernst and Rep. Jason Crow, D-Colo, a member of the House Committee on Armed Services, discussed developments concerning drone technology and the need for countermeasures. Ernst noted that China and Russia have started to focus on ""swarm technology,"" a concept discussed in U.S. Air Force papers and defined as ""a group of autonomous networked small unmanned aircraft systems operating collaboratively to achieve common objectives."" The goal of such approaches focuses on overwhelming a target and ""saturating its defenses."" ‘ ’ 'S ; ‘’T ' - ""It's not just the one-offs that are being purchased on the internet, but now we have near-peer adversaries that are developing swarm technology where they can use 100 or 200 different drones — highly, highly evolved drones that can attack our service members on the battlefield,"" she said.

Developing to better utilize such technologies would remain important as the U.S. explores these kinds of weapons as well, Crow added. ‘-’ , ""We have some really big unanswered questions, too, that we have to have some public debate about,"" he said.

""I think our sense is that it probably affects less the question of whether the Chinese leadership might choose some years down the road to use force to control Taiwan, but how and when they would do it,"" Burns said at the Aspen Security Forum.

It has ""unsettled the Chinese … since they banked on their ability to play off some Europeans against the Americans as well,"" Burns said. ""The Chinese leadership has been unsettled to some extent — especially in the first days of Putin's war in Ukraine — by what they saw. Unsettled by the military performance of the Russians early on and the performance of Russian weaponry. Unsettled by the economic uncertainties that the war is unleashed around the world in a year. ""I think Xi Jinping’s main concern is getting through a very important party congress in the autumn and having a relatively predictable global economic landscape.""

Speaking from the Aspen Security Forum Wednesday, Air Force Gen. Charles Brown, who also serves as the chief of staff of the military branch, echoed his support in training Ukrainian pilots and said the U.S. and its allies have a responsibility ""to be prepared to train them in various capabilities and capacities.""

'S 'A ' 'S '' , ""We consistently see that it’s the Chinese government that poses the biggest long-term threat to our economic and national security, and by ‘our,’ I mean both of our nations, along with our allies in Europe and elsewhere,"" Wray said, adding that ""it is the Chinese government and the Chinese Community Party that pose the threat we’re focused on countering – not the Chinese people, and certainly not Chinese immigrants in our countries – who are themselves frequently victims of the Chinese government’s lawless aggression."" Director Christopher A. Wray speaks to the media during a news conference at headquarters, on June 14, 2018, in Washington. Wray warned that the Chinese government ""poses an even more serious threat to Western businesses than even many sophisticated business people realize,"" and said the ""danger"" from China is ""complex and growing."" ""The Chinese government is set on stealing your technology – whatever it is that makes your industry tick – and using it to undercut your business, and dominate your market,"" Wray said. ""And they’re set on using every tool at their disposal to do it."" Wray warned that Beijing uses intelligence officers to target valuable private sector information, multiplying their efforts by working extensively through scores of ""co-optees,"" people who aren’t technically Chinese government officials but assist in intelligence operations. But it isn’t just large corporations China is keen on targeting. Wray said the ""wants to target companies in big cities to small towns, from Fortune 100s to start-ups,"" specifically those in aviation, artificial intelligence and pharmaceuticals. Wray said the has ""even caught people affiliated with Chinese companies out in the U.S. heartland, sneaking into fields to dig up proprietary, genetically modified seeds, which would have cost them nearly a decade and billions in research to develop themselves."" But Wray said those efforts ""pale in comparison to their lavishly resourced hacking program that’s bigger than that of every other major country – combined,"" warning that Beijing views cyber as ""the pathway to cheat and steal on a massive scale."" Meanwhile, Wray also warned of China interfering in elections, pointing to one example in New York this spring. ""The Chinese government went so far as directly interfering in a congressional election in New York, because they did not want the candidate – a Tiananmen Square protester and critic of the Chinese government – to be elected."" ' ' 'S '' , Wray detailed their efforts, including the hiring a private investigator to dig up derogatory info and derail the candidate's campaign. ""But when they couldn't find anything, they decided to manufacture a controversy using a sex worker, and when that didn't work out, they even suggested using violence, such as arranging for the candidate to be struck by a vehicle and making it look like an accident,"" Wray explained. ""The Chinese government is trying to shape the world by interfering in our politics, and those of our allies,"" Wray said. ""All of that is to say – China poses a far more complex and pervasive threat to businesses than even the most sophisticated company leaders realize."" Wray encouraged business leaders to coordinate with the and 5 in order to protect themselves. President Joe Biden meets with China's President Xi Jinping during a virtual summit from the White House, Nov. 15, 2021. But Wray also warned that China is emboldened by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, with regard to its ambitions to take Taiwan. ""When it comes to the threat against Taiwan… I’m confident in saying that China is drawing all sorts of lessons from what’s happening with Russia and its invasion of Ukraine,"" Wray said, noting that the has seen China ""looking for ways to insulate their economy against potential sanctions"" to protect themselves from ""harm if they do anything to draw the ire of the international community."" ""In our world, we call that kind of behavior a clue,"" Wray said. Wray warned that ""if China does invade Taiwan,"" Western allies could see ""supply chains and relationships disrupted."" But Wray said the U.S. and the U.K., together are ""confronting this threat and winning important battles."" ""All of us in America, in the U.K., and across the free world, are in this together,"" Wray said. ""And together, we’re an awfully formidable team."" , ' ' As for Taiwan, in March, the intelligence community annual threat assessment was released with data through January. It warned that China is increasingly a ""near-peer competitor, challenging the United States in multiple arenas – especially economically, militarily and technologically – and is pushing to change global norms and potentially threatening its neighbors."" The intelligence community warned that Beijing is using a coordinated approach to compel neighbors to ""acquiesce"" to its preferences, ""including its territorial and maritime claims and assertions of sovereignty over Taiwan."" Russian President Vladimir Putin shakes hands with his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping at the Kremlin in Moscow, June 5, 2019. ""Beijing will press Taiwan to move toward unification and will react to what it views as increased U.S.–Taiwan engagement,"" the states. ""We expect that friction will grow as China continues to increase military activity around the island and Taiwan’s leaders resist Beijing’s pressure for progress toward unification."" In April, Director William Burns issued a similar warning to Wray’s – also noting that China has been ""a silent partner"" in Russian President Vladimir Putin’s aggression in Ukraine. Burns, at the time, said China is ""in many ways, the most profound tests the has ever faced,"" calling China a ""formidable competitor lacking in neither ambition nor capability."" Meanwhile, as for the ’s move to abolish the Trump-era ""China Initiative,"" Justice Department officials were concerned that the program stoked anti-Asian bias after receiving input from the Asian American community. The replaced the program with the ""Strategy for Countering Nation-State Threats,"" saying the ""current threat landscape"" demanded ""a broader approach,"" and cited not just China, but Iran, Russia and North Korea. ""These nations seek to undermine our core democratic, economic and scientific institutions,"" Assistant Attorney General Matthew Olsen of the 's National Security Division said in March. ""And they employ a growing range of tactics to advance their interests and to harm the United States. Defending American institutions and values against these threats is a national security imperative and a priority for the Department."" Olsen, though, insisted that the new approach does not mean that the agency is losing sight of the threat China poses. ""Make no mistake, we will be relentless in defending our country from China,"" Olsen said.",20,6.833457849224723,6.383512421317185,0.44994542790753744,6

""There’s 20 plus years of mining work already in Ukraine and for every day of war there’s an additional 30 days of mining work that will be required,"" Cameron Chell, of drone company Draganfly Inc. , explained to Fox News upon his return from Kyiv.

Draganfly officials help Ukrainians detect landmines after Russian forces withdrew from Kyiv. , - However, the drone expert said where Russian troops left the explosive devices says a lot about the war Putin is raging against its former Soviet neighbor. ""We were shown some fields that there just seemed to be no reason to bomb them. There wasn’t even real action in the area, according to what we were told,"" Chell described. ""Fact is, if you just go and inadvertently bomb hectares and hectares [of land] – that’s unusable. ""It becomes unusable, unproductive land, and it would appear that it is some sort of economic terrorism,"" he added. The war in Ukraine has dragged on for more than four months. In April, Russian officials said Moscow’s ambition in Ukraine was to gain ""full control"" over its eastern and southern regions, though Kremlin officials only made this announcement after first failing to take Kyiv following a month's worth of fighting. Officials on the ground have argued this war is about more than gaining back former Soviet territory – its about crippling Kyiv.

""There's a very pragmatic approach to ‘Okay, what does this really mean over the next year, three years, five years, 10 years’,"" he said. ""I didn't come across anybody that had an expectation that this was going to be done by Christmas. ""The morale is resilient,"" Chell added. The number of landmines Russian forces deployed across Ukraine remains unknown, but by mid-May Ukrainian authorities had reported a whopping 80,000 mines and other explosive ordnance that had already been found, recorded, and disabled. ""Ukraine is now by far the most mined country in the world,"" Chell said. Draganfly officials help Ukrainians detect landmines after Russian forces withdrew from Kyiv. Draganfly’s drone technology cannot detect underwater mines yet, but its ability to find and record landmine locations is not only a safer method, but could speed up the de-mining process by up to 40%. Drone technology is also being looked into to help disable mines, though the expert said the most effective way of removing the threat of underground explosives is still by training personnel to individually disable the bombs.",7,4.653864567061258,4.9082880824116115,-0.25442351535035357,10

Photo by Yurii Kysil. Washington has responded to the deadly bombardment of Russian airstrikes and heavy artillery in Ukraine by sending the former Soviet state-turned democratic nation billions of dollars worth of equipment, but the Pentagon has all but shut the door on sending warplanes. , : Leaders of the world’s most sophisticated military have cited concerns over Ukrainian ability and the threat of escalated warfare as chief reasons why they have denied Kyiv’s repeated pleas for modern warplanes like F-16s, F-15s of A-10s. However, top fighter pilots are taking the war’s politics into their own hands and for the California Air National Guard, this means informing American leaders that Ukrainian pilots are more than capable of flying fourth-generation aircraft. The California Air National Guard has held a longstanding partnership with Ukraine and has helped to train its military under a state program since the 1990s. Swertfager, who has traveled to Ukraine more than 70 times in the last 20 years, has a personal relationship with the Ukrainian air force and told Fox News that he has spoken with his fellow pilots daily since the war began in February. ""I'm the Operations Group Commander for the California F-15 unit. One of my duties is to challenge and evaluate ability to fly combat aircraft. My professional assessment, and I've been sharing this with lawmakers this week, is these guys are more than capable of flying our aircraft. 100 percent,"" he said. -29 , ‘-’ Ukrainian fighter pilots met with a bipartisan group of U.S. senators this week in an attempt to lobby for an upgrade in planes to fight the Russian air force. A three-way deal to send American F-16s to Poland in exchange for their deployment of Soviet-era MiG-29s to Ukraine was shut down by Washington in March. Pentagon officials flagged concerns that Moscow would negatively interpret the move as direct involvement in the conflict and could escalate the war beyond Ukraine’s borders. ‘ ’ 20 : However, some have begun to question the administration’s line of reasoning as the U.S. and allies continue to send sophisticated weaponry like Howitzers, Javelins and Stinger missiles. The U.S. Air Force even created a ""Phoenix Ghost"" drone specifically designed for Ukrainian needs in its war against Russia. ""It's the political decisions being made by the civilian Pentagon leadership, but also in other parts of the Biden administration, that somehow view certain platforms as provocative but others as not,"" said Alaska Republican Sen. Dan Sullivan. ""I just actually don't agree with that assessment. ""We're sending Stinger missiles and Javelins, those are taking out helicopters, killing tank commanders. And then we're sending heavy artillery,"" he continued. ""What's the line between letting them defend themselves as something that's offensive and provocative?"" Sullivan hosted a bipartisan meeting last week with two Ukrainian fighter pilots who traveled from the front lines to Washington to outline their urgent need for modern aircraft to U.S. lawmakers. - ""The Russian air force is still very active in the east and in south of Ukraine,"" one fighter pilot who answers under the call sign ""Juice"" told Fox News. Ace Ukrainian pilot known as ""Juice,"" was in Washington D.C last week seeking more help for Ukraine's Air Force. ""Of course, they are not so stupid as during the first weeks [of the war] and they’ve changed tactics, but they're still deadly,"" he said in reference to Russia's areal bombardment. ""They're sending their attack jets and helicopters at low altitudes through the front lines to attack our war-fighters in the trenches. ""We need to react, we need to intercept them. We need to save the lives of our citizens and ground troops,"" he added. Juice, who was given his call sign while training with the California Air National Guard in 2018 after repeatedly ordering juice instead of alcohol when out with his American comrades, said the Ukrainian pilots could be trained up on modern American planes in a three to six-month period. Ukrainian pilot ""Juice"" flies. When questioned about this relatively short training period, Swertfager backed the suggestion and said he would roughly estimate that a four-month training program would suffice. ""I've flown with these guys, multiple, multiple times. And they're professional pilots,"" he said. ""They come from a Soviet doctrine, which is much different than ours, but they have adapted as a hybrid in their capabilities."" Swertfager said the Ukrainian air force has not fully integrated Western or capabilities into their fighting force, nor have they solely maintained former Soviet-era practices. ""They’re somewhere in between. And this is where I think they get a lot of advantage when they're fighting the Russians,"" he added.

But now that Russia shifted its objectives and has focused only on securing the Donbas region, it has improved its capability to wage war, with faster supply lines and better range for its heavy weapons. A former defense official told Fox News Digital that some reports indicate that ""the weapons are not getting to the Ukrainians quick enough."" ‘, , ,’: ""It seems the right weapons are just not getting there in time, and turning what could have been a clear victory for Ukraine into a Russian advantage - a fumble on the 10-yard line by the West,"" the official said. Defense officials noted it would take ""several"" months for those weapons to reach the Ukrainian forces – specifically, the Harpoon missile system, which will require weeks to transfer the weapons and train the troops in their use. ""The truck-mounted Harpoon, in this condition, in this configuration, is new, right?"" a defense official told reporters on June 15. ""And so that’s why it’s taking a little bit of time to pull the systems together for full operational capability."" - Ukrainian servicemen study a Sweden shoulder-launched weapon system Carl Gustaf M4 during a training session on the near Kharkiv, Ukraine, April 7, 2022.

""We are in constant communication with our Ukrainian counterparts discussing the evolving situation and their critical requirements,"" Lieutenant Colonel Anton T. Semelroth, Department of Defense Spokesman, told Fox News Digital. ""This coordination and our support for Ukraine will continue."" Ukraine has also grappled with hesitation from its European allies regarding the delivery of lethal aid. Some European leaders – primarily Chancellor Olaf Scholz of Germany and President Emmanuel Macron of France - have pushed for Russia and Ukraine to end the war through peace talks rather than conflict. 'S : 'S Germany, which initially delayed the delivery of lethal aid to Ukraine until two months into the invasion, has lagged significantly behind Ukraine’s other allies in delivering any of its aid: Data from German think tank The Kiel Institute indicates Germany lags behind most allies, both in terms of the amount of aid promised and the amount actually delivered – amounting to roughly 35% of its total commitment. ""You can see the breaking in the ranks in the Europeans,"" Keane told John Roberts during an appearance on ""America Reports."" ""You've got the U.K., the Baltics and Poland all in on Zelensky's side, which is drive the Russians out of my territory."" ""You've got the French and the Germans - they're not there,"" he continued. ""Where they are is they want a cease-fire: Go to negotiations as quickly as possible, end this thing as soon as possible … any kind of stalemate like that favors the Russians rather dramatically."" 'S Keane also admitted that the U.S. might favor the peace talk approach, saying, ""the United States, I think, was strongly in a little bit of both of that, to be frank about it."" That indecision and divisiveness in target and commitment is something that Russia will look to exploit as it presses its advantage to secure the Donbas region while the Ukrainians fight with depleting resources and inferior weapons. ""Russia is acutely aware of the lack of cohesion within and among European governments regarding how far the West should go to support Ukraine,"" Rebekah Koffler, president of Doctrine & Strategy Consulting, a former intelligence officer, told Fox News Digital. ""Moscow has been trying to fracture and deepen the split between Old Europe and New Europe for years by running covert intelligence operations and waging disinformation warfare."" Morgan Ortagus, a former State Department Spokesperson, argued that it is not a matter of timing but of the ""right"" weapons reaching the Ukrainians. ""The dire straits Ukraine's fighters find themselves in are not so much about delays in delivering the arms we've agreed to send - it's more that those arms aren't sufficient to tip the balance on the battlefield,"" Ortagus told Fox News Digital. ""Unfortunately we, and none more than the Ukrainians, are learning how costly it can be when we fail to deter war.""",49,4.102180278815327,3.169800188204094,0.932380090611233,9

""They are a lot of the brunt of casualties because they are the more exposed, constantly moving around trying to do things."" - Makhachek, a military engineer, led a detachment that laid minefields and other defenses, said Col. Ruslan Shutov, who attended the funeral of his friend of more than 30 years. ""Once the shelling began, he and a group hid in a shelter. There were four people in his group, and he told them to hide in the dugout. He hid in another. Unfortunately, an artillery shell hit the dugout where he was hiding."" Ukraine had about 250,000 men and women in uniform before the war and was in the process of adding another 100,000. The government hasn’t said how many have died in more than 14 weeks of fighting. Relatives of Army Col. Oleksander Makhachek mourn during his funeral in Zhytomyr, Ukraine, on Friday, June 3. Nobody really knows the number of Ukrainian civilians who have been killed or how many combatants have died on either side. Claims of casualties by government officials – who may sometimes exaggerate or lowball their figures for public relations reasons – are all but impossible to verify. Western analysts estimate far higher Russian military casualties, in the many thousands. Still, as Ukraine’s losses mount, the grim mathematics of war require that it find replacements. With a population of 43 million, it has manpower. ""The problem is recruiting, training and getting them on the front line,"" said retired U.S. Marine Col. Mark Cancian, a senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. ""If the war is now moving into a long-term attrition struggle, then you have to build systems to get replacements,"" he said. ""This has been a difficult moment for every army in combat."" Muzhenko, the Ukrainian general, said Zelenskyy’s admission of high casualties would further galvanize Ukrainian morale and that more Western weaponry would help turn the tide.",7,4.244237420659208,3.654293586881702,0.589943833777506,26
2022-06-05,Fox,https://www.foxnews.com/world/putin-russia-hit-us-supplies-long-range-missiles-ukraine,Putin says Russia will hit harder if US supplies long-range missiles to Ukraine,"President Vladimir Putin warned the West that Russia would strike new targets if the United States started supplying Ukraine with longer-range missiles, the news agency reported on Sunday. If such missiles are supplied, ""we will strike at those targets which we have not yet been hitting,"" Putin was quoted as saying in an excerpt of an interview with Rossiya-1 state television channel. The Kyiv Independent accused The New York Times of calling for the West to appease Russian President Vladimir Putin and ""give up"" assisting Ukraine in the on-going war. Putin did not name the targets Russia planned to pursue if Western countries began supplying Ukraine with longer-range missiles. He said the ""fuss"" around Western weapon supplies to Ukraine was designed to drag out the conflict. Ukraine has been seeking Multiple Rocket Launch Systems such as the M270 and M142 to strike troops and weapons stockpiles at the Russian forces' rear. U.S. President Joe Biden announced plans this week to give Ukraine precision rocket systems after receiving assurances from Kyiv that it would not use them to hit targets inside Russia. The White House has been plagued with drama in recent weeks as negative reports about President Biden’s press office coincide with a series of messaging gaffes. ) Although Russian officials have warned that the U.S. decision to supply Ukraine with advanced rocket systems could exacerbate the conflict, Putin said it would not bring on any fundamental changes on the battlefield. ""We understand that this supply from the United States and some other countries is meant to make up for the losses of this military equipment,"" Putin said. ‘ ’ I : 'S Ukraine's biggest national flag flies in Kyiv on February 26, 2022.

2022-06-04,Fox,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/american-spy-agencies-review-misses-ukraine-russia,"American spy agencies review their misses on Ukraine, Russia","The question was posed in a private briefing to U.S. intelligence officials weeks before Russia launched its invasion in late February: Was Ukraine’s leader, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, made in the mold of Britain’s Winston Churchill or Afghanistan’s Ashraf Ghani? In other words, would Zelenskyy lead a historic resistance or flee while his government collapsed? Ultimately, U.S. intelligence agencies underestimated Zelenskyy and Ukraine while overestimating Russia and its president, even as they accurately predicted Vladimir Putin would order an invasion. But Kyiv, Ukraine's capital, did not fall in a few days, as the United States had expected. And while American spy agencies have been credited with supporting Ukraine's resistance, they now face bipartisan pressure to review what they got wrong beforehand — especially after their mistakes in judging Afghanistan last year. Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines testifies during a Senate Armed Services hearing to examine worldwide threats on Capitol Hill in Washington, May 10, 2022. Intelligence officials have begun a review of how their agencies judge the will and ability of foreign governments to fight. The review is taking place while U.S. intelligence continues to have a critical role in Ukraine and as the White House ramps up weapons deliveries and support to Ukraine, trying to predict what Putin might see as escalatory and seeking to avoid a direct war with Russia. President Joe Biden's administration announced it would give Ukraine a small number of high-tech, medium-range rocket systems, a weapon that Ukraine has long wanted. Since the war began on Feb. 24, the White House has approved shipping drones, anti-tank and anti-aircraft systems, and millions of rounds of ammunition. The U.S. has lifted early restrictions on intelligence-sharing to provide information that Ukraine has used to strike critical targets, including the flagship of the Russian navy. Lawmakers from both parties question whether the U.S. could have done more before Putin invaded and whether the White House held back some support due to pessimistic assessments of Ukraine. Sen. Angus King, an independent from Maine, told officials at a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing last month that ""had we had a better handle on the prediction, we could have done more to assist the Ukrainians earlier."" Ohio Rep. Mike Turner, the top Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, said in an interview that he thought the White House and top administration officials had projected ""their own bias on the situation in a way that lends itself to inaction."" - Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines and Director Lt. General Scott Berrier appear during a Senate Armed Services hearing to examine worldwide threats on Capitol Hill in Washington, May 10, 2022. The Senate Intelligence Committee sent a classified letter last month to the Office of the Director of National Intelligence asking about how intelligence agencies assessed both Ukraine and Afghanistan. first reported the letter. Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines told lawmakers in May that the National Intelligence Council would review how the agencies assess both ""will to fight"" and ""capacity to fight."" Both issues are ""quite challenging to provide effective analysis on, and we’re looking at different methodologies for doing so,"" Haines said. While there is no announced timetable on the review, which began before the committee's letter, officials have identified some errors. Several people familiar with prewar assessments spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive intelligence. Despite its vast advantages, Russia failed to establish air superiority over Ukraine and failed at basic tasks such as securing its battlefield communications. It has lost thousands of soldiers and at least eight to 10 generals, according to U.S. estimates. Russian and Ukrainian forces are now fighting in fierce, close quarters combat in eastern Ukraine, far from the swift Russian victory forecast by the U.S. and the West. While Russia has entered recent proxy wars, it had not directly fought a major land war since the 1980s. That meant many of Russia's projected and claimed capabilities had not been put to the test, posing a challenge for analysts to assess how Russia it would perform in a major invasion, some people said. Russia's active weapons export industry led some people to believe Moscow would have many more missile systems and planes ready to deploy. ‘ ’ : . Russia has not used chemical or biological weapons, as the U.S. publicly warned it might. One official noted that the U.S. had ""very strong concerns"" about a chemical attack, but that Russia may have decided that would cause too much global opposition. Fears that Russia would use a wave of cyberattacks against Ukraine and allies have not materialized so far. A man carries water in front of an apartment building damaged in an overnight missile strike, in Sloviansk, Ukraine, May 31, 2022. Other Russian problems were well-known, including low troop morale, a prevalence of drug and alcohol abuse among troops, and the lack of a noncommissioned officer corps to oversee forces and deliver instructions from commanders. ""We knew all of those things existed,"" said retired Lt. Gen. Robert Ashley, the former director of the Defense Intelligence Agency. ""But it just became a cascading effect of how overwhelming all of that became when they tried to do even the most simple of operations."" Sue Gordon, the former principal deputy director of national intelligence, said analysts may have relied too much on counting Russia's inventory of military and cyber tools. ""We’re going to learn a little bit about how we think about capability and use as not one and the same when you assess outcome,"" she said at a recent event sponsored by The Cipher Brief, an intelligence publication. Zelenskyy has received worldwide acclaim for refusing to flee as Russia sent teams to try to capture or kill him. Britain's Churchill, throughout the yearlong blitz of London by German fighter aircraft during World War , often watched the bombing raids from rooftops, and he made special effort to walk the streets in places where thousands were killed. In contrast, Afghanistan's Ghani slipped out of his country on Sunday last August, lonely and isolated, a few months after America's top diplomat had urged him to forge a united stand as the American military pullout neared. Ghani did not even tell other political leaders who had been negotiating a peaceful transition of power with the Taliban that he was heading for the exit. His sudden and secret departure left Kabul, the capital, rudderless as U.S. and forces were in the final stages of their chaotic withdrawal from the country after 20 years. For Zelenskyy, before the war there were tensions, too, with Washington about the likelihood of a Russian invasion and whether Ukraine was prepared. One flashpoint, according to people familiar with the dispute, was that the U.S. wanted Ukraine to move forces from its west to bolster defenses around Kyiv. Until shortly before the war, Zelenskyy and top Ukrainian officials discounted warnings of an invasion, in part to tamp down public panic and protect the economy. One U.S. official said there was a belief that Zelenskyy had never been tested in a crisis of the level his country was facing. Lt. Gen. Scott Berrier, the current director of the , testified in March that ""my view was that, based on a variety of factors, that the Ukrainians were not as ready as I thought they should be. Therefore, I questioned their will to fight. That was a bad assessment on my part because they have fought bravely and honorably and are doing the right thing."" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy answers media questions during a press conference in a city subway under a central square in Kyiv, Ukraine, April 23, 2022. In May, Berrier distanced his own view from that of the entire intelligence community, which he said never had an assessment ""that said the Ukrainians lacked the will to fight."" There was ample evidence of Ukraine’s determination before the war. Russia’s 2014 annexation of Crimea and the eight-year conflict in the Donbas region had hardened public attitudes against Moscow. Ukrainian forces had received years of training and weapons shipments from the U.S. across several administrations along with help bolstering its cyber defenses. U.S. intelligence had reviewed private polling suggested strong support in Ukraine for any resistance. In Kharkiv, a mostly Russian-speaking city near the border, citizens were learning to fire guns and training for guerrilla warfare. Rep. Brad Wenstrup, a member of the House Intelligence Committee, saw that determination firsthand during a December trip. Wenstrup, R-Ohio, witnessed a military ceremony where participants would read the names of every Ukrainian soldier who had died the previous day on the front lines in the Donbas, the region in eastern Ukraine where Moscow-backed separatists have been fighting Ukrainian government forces since 2014. ""It showed to me that they had a will to fight,"" he said. ""This has been brewing for a long time.""",20,3.9478925307949795,2.95221424867985,0.9956782821151293,6

The information war has proven an understandably vital and contentious element of the overall conflict, with both Russia and Ukraine fighting for their narrative to dominate. Both sides have claimed to have killed tens of thousands of enemy combatants: Moscow says its forces have killed around 23,367 Ukrainian troops, while Kyiv counters that its troops have killed around 30,850 Russian troops. - The counterclaims are only fractions of those totals, with Kyiv saying it has lost between 2,500 and 3,000 troops while Moscow insists only 1,351 Russian troops have died in combat.

To boost Ukraine’s defenses, the U.S. announced a new spending package of $700 million in military aid, which includes funding for High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems. The latest package adds to the already robust $4.6 billion in military assistance – soon to pale in comparison to the $40 billion aid bill President Biden signed May 21. That bill included $20 billion in military funding. - The latest bill included 1,000 Javelin shoulder-launched rockets, 50 Command Launch Units, 6,000 anti-armor weapons and 15,000 155mm artillery rounds, as well as four helicopters and 15 tactical vehicles. The staggering cost is evident in other areas, too, including extreme economic trouble for Russian citizens. The World Bank has projected Russia’s economy will shrink by approximately 11.2% in 2022, while Ukraine’s economy has already shrunk an estimated 45%. The fighting and economic troubles have threatened the world’s food supply as Russia and Ukraine together account for around 30% of the world’s grain supply. Sanctions against Russia, and the threat of additional sanctions for helping it, have further hurt its trading partners as Central Asian countries struggle with the sudden loss of a major export destination. The war has therefore proven unpopular within Russia as well.

2022-06-02,Fox,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/putin-russia-hack-elections-cyberattack,Putin wants to hack our elections. Here's how we stop it,"Eric Noonan, Cybersheath , joins 'Fox News Live' to discuss the evolving risk of Russian cyberattacks. The biggest near-term question facing America’s national security establishment is clear: When and how will Russia use its considerable offensive cyber capabilities to retaliate against the United States for sweeping sanctions as well as military aid to Ukraine? While it’s extremely difficult to predict how Russian agents may use their cyber weapons against business or even public infrastructure targets abroad, U.S. intelligence experts believe that Putin’s government will continue to engage in the kind of hacking and information warfare in which it has dabbled for years: attempting to interfere with our elections. We can only assume the threat is now greater than ever. Congress and the Biden administration have a range of options—but only a narrow window of time—to fortify our defenses. After all, the next presidential election is just around the corner. To be clear, there’s no evidence that Russia has successfully changed any votes, altered or deleted any voter records, or interfered with any election night reporting in the United States in recent years. However, there’s consensus in the U.S. intelligence community that officials — under Kremlin orders — have sought to interfere in our campaigns and elections. In addition to well-publicized information operations, Russian hackers actually probed elections websites in 21 U.S. states and breached some voter-registration databases. ‘ ’ 2016 As former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper pointed out, Russian interference and disinformation campaigns were a direct response to perceived U.S. interference in Russia’s sphere of influence, including activities in support of Ukraine’s 2014 Revolution of Dignity. Beyond the partisan goals of any Russian interference operations, officials in both the Obama and Trump administrations believe that the objective has been, first and foremost, to undermine faith in America’s electoral institutions. That’s why as policymakers debate options for defending against cyberattacks, one the most important and cost-effective ways to defend ourselves is to harden targets in our election system. Our nation’s leading computer science and internet security specialists and election administrators attest that America needs investments in our nation’s election infrastructure to better ensure security. Over recent years, lawmakers from both parties have coalesced around a common agenda for election cybersecurity, sponsoring legislation to boost funding, improve security standards, ensure the use of paper ballots that provide durable records, and mainstream the use of risk-limiting audits to verify vote counts. While many Democrats have been pushing for paper ballot requirements and election security funding for more than a decade, a growing number of Republicans — including former President Trump — have been vocal in their support for these policies. In December, the leaders of prominent conservative groups — including Americans for Tax Reform, FreedomWorks, R Street Institute, James Madison Institute, and others — sent a letter to Congress calling for more federal funding for election cybersecurity. The crisis with Russia will hopefully prompt Congress to act. A significant investment in election security grants for states would substantially harden election systems as targets. Given that the security of our elections is necessary for our entire society to function, this represents an extremely cost-effective way of defending our critical national security interests. Congress should also make a commitment to offer recurring financial support so that state and local election administrators can count on reliable federal funding when developing their election budgets. The Biden administration also has options for taking immediate action. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas can require that a percentage of Homeland Security grants be used for election-related spending and request chief state election officials be involved grant applications. The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency can also hire more election specialists and boost its programming to make local officials aware of opportunities to strengthen defenses. While Russia’s interest in interfering with U.S. voting is, by this point, ""old news,"" we can’t lose sight of just how devastating a cyber-attack of an election would be to the civic life of our nation. It’s time that we start investing in defenses commensurate with the seriousness of the risk.

2022-05-23,Fox,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/ukraine-russia-war-kramatorsk,"2 ways Ukraine could win the next battle, and the war","Fox News contributor Dr. Rebecca Grant assesses what the loss of a nearly an entire Russian battalion means on ‘America Reports.’ Forget whoever told you there’s a stalemate in the Ukraine war right now. Mariupol is gone, but a hot fight is raging through eastern Ukraine. It’s Russian artillery versus Ukraine’s hit-and-run counter-offensives, and at several points the battle is touch and go. Much will depend on whether Russia can keep pushing toward the city of Kramatorsk. ‘ ’ ' ' A man carries chairs out of an office on a ground floor of an apartment building destroyed by night shelling in Kramatorsk, Ukraine, on Thursday, May 5. You remember Kramatorsk, where the Russians hit the train station on April 9 with a single ballistic -21 missile strike, killing 57, including five children. Since then, Russian forces have advanced to within about 20 miles of the city. They are even closer to Russia has forces attacking from both the north and south, pressuring cities like Syeverodonetsk. On a map, the curving Russian force position looks like a crocodile’s mouth. Let’s call it the jaws of Kramatorsk. ""The primary objective on this axis is to envelop Ukrainian forces,"" Britain’s Ministry of Defence warned May 13. If Russia succeeds, some of Ukraine’s best forces will be cut off from other units in the West. It’s the highways Putin wants. He’d like to grab the major road systems and snap the jaws shut on Kramatorsk—which was the high-water mark of Russia’s 2014 offensive before Ukraine took it back. Zelenskyy needs to hold around Kramatorsk to keep alive his hopes of pushing Russia out of the east and ultimately, all of Ukraine. Since late April, Ukraine has generated momentum by pushing Russian forces away from Kharkhiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city. Russia is still struggling with battlefield coordination, according to the Pentagon. But there’s no denying Russia has made progress by taking key highway towns like Popasna, which fell May 8. Russian tactics look like World War . The Russian army pounds each town or crossroads with artillery, then makes a frontal attack. If they move too far and fast, Ukraine’s forces strike them. Russia’s pace is ""uneven, slow, incremental, short, and small,"" in the Pentagon’s words May 16, but they have not stopped yet. Despite all this, two factors prove Ukraine’s forces have the tactical ability to win. First, U.S. and artillery and training are taking effect. ""We do believe that the howitzers are having an impact, particularly in Kharkiv,"" the Pentagon said Monday. Second, Ukraine has mastered some very sophisticated tactics. You saw the Russian tanks blown apart in the mud after attempting to cross the Donets river at Bilohorivka last week. That’s right in the crucial area east of Kramatorsk. Now consider the tactics behind it. First, Ukrainians watched the Russians set up to cross the river. Drones provided accurate positions. Then they waited, as the first Russian forces started across, and bunched up like it was the morning rush hour. Finally, Ukraine unleashed precise artillery fire, perhaps with sub-munitions that seek and hit armor. Post-strike pictures showed dozens of Russian vehicles destroyed. Ukraine displayed excellent command and control, and it tells you why Ukraine’s forces have the edge against Russian forces on the move. Who wins at Kramatorsk could also determine the next phase of the war. Mariupol was no big win for Putin. Heartbreaking as the final withdrawal of the soldiers from Azovstal was, it doesn’t dent Ukraine’s growing combat power. ""We hope to save the lives of our boys,"" President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Tuesday. ""Ukraine needs Ukrainian heroes alive."" But if Putin gets Kramatorsk, Russia’s army can take the roads from Izyum to Donetsk, lock down control in the east and consider new options. Russia has 50 Battalion Tactical Groups in the south in position for new operations to landlock Ukraine. If Ukraine holds open the jaws of Kramatorsk, Ukraine can push Russia out of Izyum and start taking back other towns along the 100-mile front. Zelenskyy’s new total victory plan will eventually require Ukraine to increase the pressure, such as by striking Russian military targets in Crimea, for example. It will be much harder to win if Kramatorsk falls. Sadly, Putin has enough oil money to keep up the slow, ugly fight into summer. Ukraine may need two or three more big U.S. aid packages and help from to keep going. Russia’s illegal invasion has brought evil back to Europe. That’s why Sweden is poised to give up over 200 years of neutrality and join . Sweden hasn’t fought a war or joined an alliance since 1814, the era of Napoleon’s wars. Russia’s brutality and threats have changed all that. And it’s not just Putin, who is, obviously, far crazier than we knew. The war in Ukraine daily reveals the sheer barbarism among Russia’s generals. Can you believe President Joe Biden ever thought sanctions would stop the bleeding?",7,2.8463678656919438,3.150611200204611,-0.3042433345126674,5

""We said we're probably not the right guys, but they said ‘you’re all we have,’ so we read the manuals, we looked at everything we could get our hands on,"" Hayward explained. ""We were self-taught Javelin instructors, and we were super lucky because after a couple of days, other volunteers in the U.S. and U.K. would come out of the woodwork … so we had other volunteers come forward."" The trickiest part – after learning on the fly how to use the weapon – was teaching the troops without much ability to actually try out the weapon before deploying them into the field, due to limited supplies. Each Javelin had a non-rechargeable battery that was good for only two things: once the Command Launch Unit was on, the battery could either power top-notch thermal night sight for four hours or try to launch between two and four missiles. : ‘ ’ ""It's kind of variable depending on how much time you spend acquiring your target,"" Hayward said. ""The Marines had not been issued enough batteries to do anything other than get out there and shoot some missiles, which meant that, since they didn't have any other choice, the guns were almost like a Hail Mary for them."" The Ukrainian engineers provided some relief by helping build prototype external rechargeable battery packs – a field innovation they managed to pull together within 48 hours. But without anyone to help them verify the safety, they had to deploy the batteries without much testing. They plugged the prototype into a $100,000 , and it worked without a problem. ""It didn’t blow up and it worked just fine, and suddenly we were in business,"" Hayward said. ""Suddenly, we were in business, we could actually train on how to use these missiles."" Sending the troops out with minimal practical training unnerved Hayward, and he can only hope that the U.S. continues to provide the kind of weapons and training the Ukrainians need to defend their homeland.

""They have threatened to use nuclear war, and the West has supported these military actions carried out in our neighborhood, and that is why it was a threat we couldn’t accept,"" Putin stated. ‘ ,’ ‘’ He also condemned the U.S. by name, saying it has ""tried to denigrate the memory of the Second World War."" But Russia did not boost its offensives following the celebration and may have actually signaled intent to wrap up the invasion with the integration of the Kherson region. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said completion of the ""special operation"" would stop the West’s attempts to ""promote a unipolar world,"" which Lavrov defined as ""attempts to undermine international law."" This marked the first time since the beginning of the invasion that any senior official has mentioned the idea of ending the ""special operation,"" according to former officer Rebekah Koffler.

Leaders say it is expected to replace the Stryker Brigade in the state with a more mobile infantry unit. ""I think right now the purpose of Army forces in Alaska is much more about creating an extreme cold weather capable formation"" that could be used in Europe or the Indo-Pacific, Army Secretary Christine Wormuth told The Associated Press. ""We’re trying to get to a place where we have Arctic capable forces — forces that can survive and operate in that environment."" She said she expects to make a final decision about the troop change soon, including likely converting the Stryker unit to an infantry brigade. - Capt. Corey Wheeler, front, commander of B Company, 1st Battalion, 52nd Aviation Regiment at Fort Wainwright, Alaska, walks away from a Chinook helicopter that landed on the glacier near Denali, April 24, 2016, on the Kahiltna Glacier in Alaska. The 1st Stryker Brigade Combat Team, 25th Infantry Division, would be converted to a light infantry brigade. The unit and the division's 4th Infantry Brigade Combat team would become the 11th Airborne Division, based in Alaska. Wormuth said that Stryker vehicles would be replaced by some that are more suitable for the terrain. ""I think it really makes sense to have forces trained in the Arctic environments that they would be used for,"" she said. ""If we’re going to have ground forces in Alaska, that’s what we need them to be able to do. They can’t get that experience going to the Mojave Desert or to Fort Polk."" - 1M -19 The revisions were under consideration before Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February. Any final decision would need approval from Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin. ""If you’re going to do big movements of equipment and things like that, the summer is a pretty important window because it’s a lot easier to move vehicles around than doing it in the dead of winter,"" Wormuth explained, telling members of Congress that the Army would offset Stryker losses by increasing the size and capabilities of the headquarters.

The U.S., Wormuth said, has previously resisted moves to militarize the Arctic, even as Russia has expanded its military presence there. Wormuth wondered if that mindset will be revisited in the near future. In April, the secretary watched an Army brigade wage war against fictional ""Denovian"" forces from California's dusty Mojave Desert.

""As we’re watching what’s happening to the Russians now, it’s informative for us to think about what is right, from a modernization standpoint,"" she said, noting that some U.S. tanks are very heavy and that Europe is muddier.

""If you look back to stuff like the WannaCry and NotPetya events ... bad guys took them, tweaked them and throw them right back at you, so we get into this dangerous situation where if Russia did decide to use something that we hadn't seen before, somebody else would undoubtedly get hold of it, do some research, break apart, figure out what they could do with it,"" Stamford said. 'S : ‘ ’ - The issue grows more complicated due to the fact that Moscow appears to operate with a model that allows free reign for individual operators to attack foreign targets without explicit direction or acknowledgment from the government. The U.S. has faced a few different hacking crises that officials tied back to Russian actors, such as the SolarWinds hack - tied to hackers acting at the direction of Russia's intelligence service - and the Colonial Pipeline hack - believed to be the act of a lone Russian hacker that local police arrested. Putin also recently signed an initiative to bolster Russia's cyber defenses, which former defense official James Anderson said could be a move to further entangle state and business enterprises in the country. ""The public effort to ban Russia from using cyber security tools from ""unfriendly countries"" appears, at least in part, to be a face-saving measure, since many major Western technology firms have already withdrawn from the Russian market in response to Moscow's brutish invasion of Ukraine,"" Anderson explained. ""In addition to helping Russia to better protect itself from hackers, the cyber security decree probably reflects Putin's desire to further extend his authoritarian tentacles, since state corporations and other strategically important enterprises will be required to provide the state's security services with ""unhindered access to information resources."" , But the U.S. should remain confident in its ability to defend against attacks from foreign actors, especially with the implementation of quantum computing, according to Martin Moore, a retired Special Forces Sergeant Major and Owner of ZeroOneAngus . ""I think quantum computing and having that post-quantum encryption is better than relying on a firewall to protect us - that is a higher priority,"" Moore said. ""A firewall can only protect traffic and data leaks. We need protection and systems that don't have back and side doors build in."" Quantum computing simply allows for an increase in the already incredible number of calculations a machine could make, going through ""a million keys"" in moments. ' The U.S. may not provide a national firewall in the way that Russia and China have aimed to do, but companies and government agencies can start to wrap quantum encryption around what is already ""robust"" encryption that is widely used. The Department of Homeland Security leads the national effort to improve cybersecurity through the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency . Moore attributes the success of American companies to their approach, which assumes that companies and users operate in a ""zero trust environment."" ""We know everything is vulnerable and it's always going to be vulnerable and we have to stay ahead of that, and it's tough to stay ahead of that when there's so many variables at play,"" Moore said. ""So I think developing a system that cannot be penetrated is going to be almost impossible."" ""We have to put more effort into understanding the threat and the potential threat and doing something about it, because we think that even though we think we're secure, we're not,"" he added. ""You can never know, and we should treat everything as if it is a ‘Zero Trust’ environment.""",20,5.387573329554606,5.279083356557248,0.10848997299735874,24

As of Monday, Ukrainian forces have pushed the Russian army about 25 miles away from Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second largest city, according to the official.

The game-changing impact of those arms is exactly what President Joe Biden hopes to spotlight as he visits a Lockheed Martin plant in Alabama on Tuesday that builds the portable Javelin anti-tank weapons that have played a crucial role in Ukraine. U.S. Air Force Airman Megan Konsmo, from Tacoma, Wash., checks pallets of equipment ultimately bound for Ukraine in the Super Port of the 436th Aerial Port Squadron, Friday, April 29, 2022, at Dover Air Force Base, Del. But Biden’s visit is also drawing attention to a growing concern as the war drags on: Can the U.S. sustain the cadence of shipping vast amounts of arms to Ukraine while maintaining the healthy stockpile it may need if a new conflict erupts with North Korea, Iran or elsewhere? The U.S. already has provided about 7,000 Javelins, including some that were delivered during the Trump administration, about one-third of its stockpile, to Ukraine, according to an analysis by Mark Cancian, a senior adviser with the Center for Strategic and International Studies international security program. The Biden administration says it has committed to sending about 5,500 to Ukraine since the Russian invasion more than two months ago. Analysts also estimate that the United States has sent about one-quarter of its stockpile of shoulder-fired Stinger missiles to Ukraine. Raytheon Technologies Greg Hayes told investors last week during a quarterly call that his company, which makes the weapons system, wouldn’t be able to ramp up production until next year due to parts shortages. ""Could this be a problem? The short answer is, ‘Probably, yes,'"" said Cancian, a retired Marine colonel and former government specialist on Pentagon budget strategy, war funding and procurement. He said that Stingers and Javelins were where ""we’re seeing the most significant inventory issues,"" and production of both weapons systems has been limited in recent years.

Airmen push over 8,000 pounds of 155 mm shells ultimately bound for Ukraine on to a C-17 aircraft for transport, Friday, April 29, 2022, at Dover Air Force Base, Del. The Russian invasion offers the U.S. and European defense industry a big opportunity to bolster profits as lawmakers from Washington to Warsaw are primed to increase defense spending in response to Russian aggression. Defense contractors, however, face the same supply chain and labor shortage challenges that other manufacturers are facing, along with some others that are specific to the industry. Military spending by the U.S. and around the world was rising even before Russia’s Feb. 24 invasion. Biden’s proposed 2023 budget sought $773 billion for the Pentagon, an annual increase of about 4%. Globally, total military spending rose 0.7% to more than $2 trillion for the first time in 2021, according to an April report from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. Russia ranked fifth, as its spending on weapons increased ahead of its invasion of Ukraine. A ‘ ’: . The war will mean increased sales for some defense contractors, including Raytheon, which makes the Stinger missiles Ukrainian troops have used to knock out Russian aircraft. The company is also part of a joint venture with Lockheed Martin that makes the Javelins. Biden will visit Lockheed Martin's facility in Troy, Ala., which has the capacity to manufacture about 2,100 Javelins per year. The trip comes as he presses Congress to quickly approve his request for an additional $33 billion in security and economic assistance for Kyiv, Western allies and restocking weapons the U.S. has sent to those countries. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said Monday he hoped quick bipartisan agreement on the security package could be reached so the Senate could begin considering it ""as early as next week."" U.S. Air Force Airman Megan Konsmo, from Tacoma, Wash., checks pallets of helmets ultimately bound for Ukraine in the Super Port of the 436th Aerial Port Squadron, Friday, April 29, 2022, at Dover Air Force Base, Del. The president is expected to use his remarks to highlight the importance of the Javelins and other U.S. weaponry in helping Ukraine's military put up a vigorous fight as he makes the case to keep security and economic assistance flowing. A White House official, who was not authorized to comment publicly and requested anonymity, said the Pentagon is working with defense contractors ""to evaluate the health of weapons systems’ production lines and examine bottlenecks in every component and step of the manufacturing process."" The administration is also considering a range of options, if needed, to boost production of both Javelins and Stingers, the official said. Pentagon press secretary John Kirby said Monday that America’s military readiness is not dependent on one system, such as the Javelin. He said that every time the Pentagon develops a package of weapons to send to Ukraine, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the department assesses the broader impact. ""It’s not about counting say Javelins and being able to say that when you reach a certain level then all your readiness is gone,"" Kirby said. ""The Javelin is an anti-armor capability, so we judge it all as a conglomerate of what’s our ability to meet this particular mission set, realizing that a Javelin isn’t the only capability you have against armor."" Cancian, the former government specialist on defense budget strategy, said the fact that Stingers and Javelins were not included in the most recent tranche of weapons the Biden administration announced it was sending to Ukraine could be a sign that Pentagon officials are mindful about inventory as they conduct contingency planning for other possible conflicts. ""There’s no question that whatever war plan they're looking at there is risk associated with the depleting levels of Stingers and Javelins, and I’m sure that they’re having that discussion at the Pentagon,"" he said. Airmen with the 436th Aerial Port Squadron place 155 mm shells on aircraft pallets ultimately bound for Ukraine, Friday, April 29, 2022, at Dover Air Force Base, Del. The U.S. military effort to move weaponry to Eastern Europe for Ukraine’s fight has been Herculean. From Dover Air Base in Delaware, U.S. airmen have carried out nearly 70 missions to deliver some 7 million pounds of Javelins, Stingers, 155mm howitzers, helmets and other essentials to Eastern Europe since February. Col. Matt Husemann, commander of the 436th Airlift Wing, described the mission as a ""whole of government approach that’s delivering hope."" ""It is awesome,"" said Husemann, after providing with a recent tour of the airlift operation. $7B The lightweight but lethal Javelin has helped the Ukrainians inflict major damage on Russia's larger and better-equipped military. As a result, the weapon has gained almost mythic regard, celebrated with a Javelin song and images of Mary Magdalene carrying a Javelin becoming a meme in Ukraine. Lockheed Martin James Taiclet said in a recent interview that demand for the Javelin and other weapon systems would increase broadly over time because of the Russian invasion. He said the company was working ""to get our supply chain ramped up."" ""We have the ability to meet current production demands, are investing in increased capacity and are exploring ways to further increase production as needed,"" Lockheed Martin said in a statement. Pentagon officials recently sat down with some of the leading defense contractors, including Lockheed Martin, Raytheon, Boeing, General Dynamics, Systems and Northrop Grumman to discuss efforts to ramp up production. Pallets of 155 mm shells and fuses are loaded, ultimately bound for Ukraine, Friday, April 29, 2022, at Dover Air Force Base, Del. The big defense contractors face some serious challenges. Raytheon, for example, can’t simply crank out Stingers to replace the 1,400 that the U.S. sent to Ukraine. Hayes, the Raytheon , said in a recent conference call with analysts that the company has only limited supplies of components to make the missile. Only one undisclosed country has been buying them in recent years, and the Pentagon hasn’t bought any new ones in nearly 20 years. Sanctions further complicate the picture. Companies must find new sources of important raw materials such as titanium, a crucial component in aerospace manufacturing that is produced in Russia. Concerns about the Stinger stockpile have been raised by House Armed Services Committee chairman Rep. Adam Smith, D-Wash., and the top Republican on the committee, Rep. Mike Rogers of Alabama. The two in March wrote to Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley, describing the stockpile issue as one of ""urgency."" Rogers said he remains concerned that the matter hasn't been properly addressed.",49,4.990896766290861,4.911365634919661,0.07953113137120038,9

They are expected to arrive in Zaporizhzhia, about 140 miles northwest of the city. The operation to remove the civilians is being coordinated by the United Nations and the International Committee of the Red Cross. It comes after the plant has suffered weeks of attacks by Russian forces, killing an unknown number of people and wounding at least 600. The wounded were being attended to by a small medical staff, with some victims reportedly suffering from gangrene and other life-threatening conditions because of the inability to provide advanced medical care.

2022-04-26,Fox,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/defense-secretary-austin-russia-ukraine-rebecca-grant,Defense Secretary Austin's plan to weaken Russia could be a Ukraine game changer,"Defense Secretary Gen. Lloyd Austin speaks to Fox News' Jennifer Griffin in Germany after meeting with dozens of defense ministers on the war in Ukraine. On Monday morning in Poland, after his visit to Kyiv, Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin laid down a new take on Russia with these six words: ""We want to see Russia weakened."" Wow. Austin is the first senior cabinet member to state the intent to weaken Russia’s military. Usually they talk about deterrence. Looks like the Pentagon finally found its sense of urgency, and then some. On Tuesday, Austin hosted 40 nations at Ramstein Air Base in Germany to line up more military aid for Ukraine. 'S ' ' '' But as Austin’s statements make clear, this is not just about helping Ukraine. It’s about grinding down Russia as a land power, too. U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken. ""We want to see Russia weakened to the degree that it can’t do the kinds of things that it has done in invading Ukraine,"" Austin said. Russia has lost ""a lot of military capability"" and troops, according to Austin. He wants to make sure Russia can’t ""very quickly reproduce that capability."" ""I think the secretary said it very well,"" echoed Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who was standing right beside Austin in front of shrink-wrapped pallets of military assistance bound for Ukraine. As Winston Churchill said, Americans will do the right thing after they’ve tried everything else. Now Austin must deliver on enough military assistance, training and tactical coaching for Ukraine to maul Russia’s forces. What changed? Credit Ukraine’s success on the battlefield and Zelenskyy’s leadership. Russia’s brutality is an equally important factor. From the devastation of Mariupol to the graves of Bucha, Putin has unleashed horror not seen in Europe since World War . , ‘’ : ' . ' Taking down Russia’s military capability is the only way to ensure it won’t happen again. Austin has quietly moved U.S. policy to a stance almost unthinkable two months ago.

A fallen rocket that was fired from Kherson but got intercepted by Ukrainian forces remains unexploded in the street in Mykolaiv, Ukraine on April 4. Perhaps it was that train ride from southwest Poland to Kyiv and back on an Orthodox Easter Sunday somber with ""despair and blood"" as the Washington Post headlined it. Or maybe it was the actual meeting with President Zelenskyy, where Blinken and Austin came face-to-face with a Ukrainian leadership team they’d greatly underestimated. In Kyiv, the Americans ""expressed our deepest condolences for the loss of so many civilians, and, of course, the loss of those courageous troops that have done such a magnificent job of pushing back Russian forces,"" Austin said Monday. Now Austin must deliver on enough military assistance, training and tactical coaching for Ukraine to maul Russia’s forces. Apparently that’s the plan. On Friday, the Pentagon’s new chief weapons buyer Dr. William LaPlante sent out an urgent request to U.S. industry for ideas on weapons systems or commercial capabilities for Ukraine, including air defense, anti-armor, coastal defense, counter-battery radar, drones, secure radios and satellite internet. Zelenskyy won't get U.S. ground troops. Ukraine’s never asked for them. So a lot is riding on heavy artillery, lethal drones, better battlefield intelligence, and taking advantage of the Russian army’s limitations in maneuver and command and control. Of course, victory for Ukraine comes first. ""They have the mindset that they want to win; we have the mindset that we want to help them win, and we are going to do that,"" Austin said. Still, to my mind, Austin is the first U.S. defense secretary who has a chance to do more than deter Russia. If Ukraine defeats Russia’s invading forces, Austin can reset U.S. and security for a generation. Plenty of challenges remain, like Russia’s expanding nuclear arsenal and their ties to China. On that point, Austin’s new goal of weakening Russian forces – and hampering Russia’s efforts to rebuild its military losses – pays off double. A degraded Russian military, thrashed on the battlefield, won’t be such an attractive military partner for China, either. Maybe this is the Austin doctrine – weakening Russia’s military to enhance world security. Churchill would approve.",49,3.900108752038007,3.8574641853657234,0.042644566672283446,5

""We really hope that with the help of other western leaders, other leaders of civilized world, we will be able to save kids and women who are still in the basement of the massive Azovstal plant."" - Mariupol has been a key Russian objective since the Feb. 24 invasion began. Capturing the city would allow the establishment of a land corridor from Russia's border to Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula that Moscow annexed in 2014. It also would deprive Ukraine of a major port and prized industrial assets. The bulk of the neon used in advanced microprocessors, for instance, comes from firms based in Mariupol. Smoke rises above Azovstal steelworks, in Mariupol, Ukraine, in this still image obtained from a recent drone video posted on social media. Since the battle for the city began March 1, the Russian military has pummeled Mariupol relentlessly with artillery barrages and air raids, flattening most of the once-bustling city. The indiscriminate bombardment has hit homes, hospitals and other public buildings, killing thousands. Mariupol Mayor Vadym Boychenko estimates that at least 21,000 people were killed in Mariupol and another 120,000 people remain in Mariupol out of a prewar population of about 450,000.

2022-04-24,Fox,https://www.foxnews.com/world/ukraine-leader-pushes-more-arms-us-officials-visit,Ukraine leader pushes for more arms; US officials to visit,"Ukraine’s leader petitioned for more powerful Western weapons as he prepared to meet with top U.S. officials in the war-torn country’s capital Sunday and Russian forces concentrated their attacks on the east, including trying to dislodge the last Ukrainian troops holding out in the battered port city of Mariupol. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy announced the planned visit by U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin during a lengthy Saturday night news conference held in a Kyiv subway station. The White House has not commented. Zelenskyy said he was looking for the Americans to produce results, both in terms of arms and security guarantees. ""You can’t come to us empty-handed today, and we are expecting not just presents or some kind of cakes, we are expecting specific things and specific weapons,″ he said. The visit would be the first by senior U.S. officials since Russia invaded Ukraine 60 days ago. Blinken stepped briefly onto Ukrainian soil in March to meet with the country’s foreign minister during a visit to Poland. Zelenskyy’s last face-to-face meeting with a U.S. leader was Feb. 19 in Munich with Vice President Kamala Harris. The meeting was set to take place as Ukrainians and Russians observed Orthodox Easter, celebrating the resurrection of Jesus Christ and considered the most joyful holiday on the Christian calendar. Speaking Sunday from the ancient St. Sophia Cathedral, Zelenskyy, who is Jewish, highlighted the allegorical significance of the occasion to a nation wracked by nearly two months of war. Worshippers light candles at St. Volodymyr's Cathedral during Orthodox Easter celebrations in Kyiv, Ukraine, Sunday, April 24, 2022. ""The great holiday today gives us great hope and unwavering faith that light will overcome darkness, good will overcome evil, life will overcome death and therefore Ukraine will surely win,"" he said. Earlier, during his nightly address to the nation, Zelenskyy claimed that intercepted communications recorded Russian troops discussing ""how they conceal the traces of their crimes"" in Mariupol. The president also highlighted the death of a 3-month old girl in a Russian missile strike Saturday on the Black Sea port of Odesa. , , Zelenskyy said that equipment from Western supporters had been a big help so far, but he also has stressed that Ukraine needs more heavy weapons, including long-range air defense systems and warplanes to fend off the Russian attacks. The Russian military reported that it hit 423 Ukrainian targets overnight, including fortified positions and troop concentrations, while Russian warplanes destroyed 26 Ukrainian military sites, including an explosives factory and several artillery depots. Most of the fighting Sunday focused on the eastern Donbas region, where Ukrainian forces are concentrated and where Moscow-backed separatists controlled some territory before the war. Since failing to capture Kyiv, the Russians are aiming to gain full control over Ukraine’s eastern industrial heartland. Russian forces launched fresh airstrikes on a Mariupol steel plant, where an estimated 1,000 civilians are sheltering along with about 2,000 Ukrainian fighters. The Azovstal steel mill where the defenders are holed up is the last corner of resistance in the city, which the Russians have otherwise occupied. A part of a destroyed tank and a burned vehicle sit in an area controlled by Russian-backed separatist forces in Mariupol, Ukraine, Saturday, April 23, 2022. Mykhailo Podolyak, a Ukrainian presidential adviser, called for a localized Easter truce. He urged Russia to allow civilians to leave the plant and suggested talks to negotiate an exit for the Ukrainian soldiers. Podolyak tweeted that the Russian military was attacking the plant with heavy bombs and artillery while accumulating forces and equipment for a direct assault. Mariupol has been the focus of fierce fighting since the start of the war due to its location on the Sea of Azov. Its capture would deprive Ukraine of a vital port, free up Russian troops to fight elsewhere, and allow Moscow to establish a land corridor to the Crimean Peninsula, which it seized from Ukraine in 2014. More than 100,000 people — down from a prewar population of about 430,000 — are believed to remain in Mariupol with scant food, water or heat. Ukrainian authorities estimate that over 20,000 civilians have been killed. Satellite images released this week showed what appeared to be mass graves dug in towns to the west and east of Mariupol. Zelenskyy accused the Russians of committing war crimes by killing civilians, as well as of setting up ""filtration camps"" near Mariupol for people caught trying to leave the city. From there, he said, Ukrainians are sent to areas under Russian occupation or to Russia itself, often as far as Siberia or the Far East. Many of them, he said, are children.

2022-04-22,Fox,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/russian-cyber-threat-nato-jason-blessing,The Russian cyber threat is here to stay and NATO needs to understand it,"Rep. Jake Auchincloss, D-Mass., on how the U.S. could support Ukraine during Russia’s invasion. Since the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the Biden administration has escalated warnings about likely Russian cyber-attacks on American infrastructure and business. More worrying still, cyber alarmists like Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Mark Warner, D-Va., have suggested that cyber-attacks from the Kremlin could be acts of war that trigger ’s collective defense. This sky-is-falling delusion, particularly from leaders with access to classified intelligence, is at best counterproductive and at worst dangerous. Cyber-attacks are rarely acts of war, and treating them as if they are undermines ’s ability to deal with real threats short of cyber war. , has only invoked Article 5 – which triggers a collective response – once and that was after the 9/11 attacks. Cyber-attacks are unlikely to destroy buildings and kill thousands in an instant. While collective defense extends to cyberspace, few operations could realistically be a cause for war. This would include cyber-attacks resulting in death or damage like traditional military operations or coordinated assaults that take the power grid or entire economic sectors offline. These scenarios are unlikely though: such attacks require far too much time, funding, manpower, and control. Instead, most attacks temporarily overwhelm servers with traffic, deny network access, hold computers hostage, and steal or delete data. Building cyber resilience is an important step forward. It acknowledges that, in many cases, the Russians will get the best of us in cyberspace. Even if allies wanted to trigger Article 5 over cyber operations, disagreements about the definitions of threats, origins of attacks, and pain thresholds in cyberspace can derail the process. 'S ' ' Collective retaliation requires a unanimous vote across ; building unity across these points is nearly impossible for most cyber activity. Unlike missile attacks or tanks in the streets, few ""red lines"" exist to distinguish cybercrime, cyber espionage, and cyber disruption from digital acts of war. Beyond the bureaucratic and logistical limitations of elevating cyber to a casus belli, focusing on cyber-attacks as acts of war distracts from the more likely Russian digital assaults below the level of armed conflict. These include ransomware attacks and supply chain infiltrations that look like criminal activity or espionage. The Kremlin is particularly adept at the latter. In the SolarWinds compromise, Russia hacked one company’s software product to access networks of Fortune 500 companies and U.S. government agencies. Spillover from operations in Ukraine poses an additional risk. The Russians have already deployed several digital tools to destroy computer data, resulting in corrupted computers for Ukrainian companies with government support roles. The same malicious software has also affected several Latvian and Lithuanian businesses. Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg speaks to the press ahead of a meeting of foreign ministers at headquarters, in Brussels, Belgium, Nov. 26, 2021. The danger is another situation like NotPetya in 2017, where malware self-replicated, spread past Ukrainian targets to cripple networks in over 150 countries, and created $10 billion in damages. Each of these scenarios are much more likely than a ""cyber doomsday"" that would justify an Article 5 response from members. To be fair, policymakers’ fears of cyber war have led to some positive developments for the alliance. For instance, over the last several years, has developed its own framework for combining cyber and conventional military capabilities in warfighting. But allies remain unprepared to deal with ""death by 1000 cuts"" in cyberspace. Concentrating only on acts of war comes at the expense of addressing the cumulative costs of low-level cyber threats over time. It leads to an overreliance on cyber deterrence or defensive whack-a-mole strategies, neither of which are sustainable. Threats of retaliation simply don’t deter most cyber-attacks, and it is unrealistic for defensive measures to stop every hacker. Policymakers across must acknowledge that security failures are the norm in cyberspace, and that the compounding costs of failure over time are every bit as dangerous as the threat of cyber war. Building cyber resilience is an important step forward. It acknowledges that, in many cases, the Russians will get the best of us in cyberspace. The focus is on controlling failures to limit damage and quickly get networks back online. Moving from buzzword to actual strategy requires addressing several questions. Which digital assets are most significant? Where is the alliance most exposed to Russian cyber-attacks? Where should reduce operating risks, and in what areas can it assume more? How can allies track long-term trends and adapt to new technologies? The Russian cyber threat is here to stay. Collective defense is – and should remain – the cornerstone of . But time is running out for the alliance to protect itself from scenarios that aren’t all-out cyber war.",20,6.174804989086417,6.468936904070067,-0.2941319149836499,24

The official said the newest drone would have similar capabilities to the Switchblade drone – which is small enough to be carried in a backpack, easily launched and detonates after it crashes into its target – but would not comment further on its scope of capabilities. The officials also would not specify how quickly the Air Force was able to develop the drone but said it was created in a ""direct response to Ukrainian requirements."" ""The fighting in the Donbas is going to be heavily reliant on artillery,"" the senior U.S. defense official said. ""Artillery systems and artillery rounds are what the Ukrainians say they need and we think they're saying it with good reason. It's no surprise that the Russians are also relying on artillery and bringing in artillery enablers before they started to bring in ground forces."" An additional $800 million dollars for Ukraine was approved by the Biden administration Thursday as Russia looks to pinch the Donbas region by invading down from the north through the Kharkiv region and up through the south by way of Mariupol.

""It's based on talking to the Ukrainians about what they need,"" the official said.

Howitzers, which are long-range weapons similar to a canon, tactical vehicles to tow the Howitzers, field equipment and spare parts were also included in the package. Officials said the ""Phoenix Ghost"" will require minimal instruction and that the U.S. will be working with Ukrainian armed forces to get them trained up on the drones.

2022-04-18,Fox,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/russia-putin-ukraine-war-bob-maginnis,Russia's Putin isn't finished in Ukraine,"Fox News correspondent Trey Yingst provides live updates of the Russia-Ukraine war and the impending investigation of suspected war crimes committed by Russia on 'Your World.' General Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs, testified that the war in Ukraine is likely to go on for ""years."" What are the indicators that war could last ""years"" and what might be the consequences for the West? Predicting how long a war might last isn’t a precise science. In August 1914, German Emperor Wilhelm promised his deploying troops they would be home before winter. Meanwhile, his Chief of the German General Staff predicted what became the First World War would last up to two years. An armed serviceman of Donetsk People's Republic militia walks past a building damaged during fighting in Mariupol on Wednesday. Soon both German leaders faced a new reality. The ensuing fight pitted two great alliance blocs, the Triple Entente and the Triple Alliance, involved millions of soldiers, consumed the lifeblood of entire nations, and ultimately lasted four and a half years. The costs of that ""War to End All Wars,"" which involved more than 100 countries were staggering: as much as $337 billion in direct and indirect costs. The human toll was equally sobering: 12 million dead and 20 million severely wounded. Seven weeks into the Ukraine war, no one is predicting the fight will mushroom into World War much less be as expensive and bloody as the First World War. However, it’s clear that Moscow isn’t finished and the toll in blood and treasure will grow. Russian President Vladimir Putin appears to have abandoned his hopes of capturing Ukraine’s capital city of Kyiv and is now focused on the Donbas and Luhansk regions. Russian movements suggest their forces hope to encircle the Ukrainian army’s most capable combat units in the east and force a surrender, destroying any hope Kyiv has of regaining control over the east. So, given Putin’s changed plans, what are the indicators that persuaded General Milley that the war is likely to last ""years""? First, Russia appears to have adopted a new, harsher strategy. President Putin replaced his field commander seeking different results, no matter how long it takes. He selected Gen. Alexander Dvorikov, a man known as the ""Butcher of Syria,"" to oversee the fresh assault on Ukraine. However, there is a problem for Russia with a new albeit harsher strategy. Time is not on their side. Khrystyna Holynska, a defense and security policy researcher reminds us ""This is still the same Russian military with low morale, distrust in the ranks, weapons systems and logistics problems, and many other issues that have been widely discussed"" and they ""cannot be solved quickly."" Second, due to heavy losses in tanks and troops, Putin has dipped into his reserves, a pool of two million men, to mobilize 20 Russian National Guard units. This is the first time the Rosgvardiya has been mobilized for anything other than rear area operations. Calling up these units and putting them into the fight indicates Moscow’s forces are severely stretched, or he’s holding back his best fighters for other operations, perhaps evidence of fighting elsewhere. Third, the Ukrainians are taking the fight to Russia, which could extend the war. Russian regional authorities along Ukraine’s border increased the terrorism threat level because of the presence of Ukrainian special operations forces intent on sabotage attacks. For example, on April 1st a Ukrainian Mi-24 helicopter attacked a Russian oil depot in Belgorod and again on April 12th a railroad track inside Russia leading to Kharkov, Ukraine was sabotaged, another indicator of Kyiv’s intent. Fourth, the Ukrainians will long hold a grudge against Russia for their war crimes, which will likely extend the fighting.The Ukrainians surprised the Russians with their resilience, but it is the Russian atrocities, such as in Bucha, that will fuel their anger against Moscow for decades to come. Fifth, the longevity of the war is directly tethered to continued Western support to Ukraine such as the flow of arms. Military assistance to Ukraine is pouring in from the West to sustain the Ukrainian fight. Slovakia is providing S-300 air defense systems, the Czech Republic is sending T-72 tanks and the is sending thousands of Javelin anti-armor weapons, artillery and radars, and more than a thousand Stinger shoulder-fired surface-to-air missiles along with hundreds of Switchblade suicide drones. Regardless of Ukraine’s efforts and the West’s flow of arms, Moscow is ultimately capable of committing more assets than Ukraine which means over time the Kremlin’s mass could ultimately crush Ukraine’s better tactics, and home field advantage, especially should the West grow weary of financing that war. Finally, Putin calculates that he can resource a long war thanks to two key Russian exports, energy and grain. The West’s crippling sanctions are failing to break Moscow’s ambitions to sustain its ""Special Military Operation."" In fact, Russia expects to earn almost $10 billion in additional revenue from energy sales in April 2022, thanks to high oil prices. Further, the Biden administration’s sanctions will ""… not affect this war in the short run, because Russia’s military is fighting with tanks it had already built and soldiers it had already trained,"" said, Johan Norberg, an analyst at the Swedish Defense Research Agency. Besides, Moscow can comfortably pay for the war because it can simply commandeer resources like fuel from state-owned companies. These indicators can be understood as prolonging the war. Alternatively, Russia’s new focus could position Putin to claim a quick ""victory"" followed by a ceasefire along a new line of control in Donbas. Then Putin celebrates his ""victory"" at the annual May 9th World War Victory Day celebration at the Kremlin. Whether the fight continues for years or is cut short, there are long-term questions for the West which require answers. Will permanently station forces along Russia’s border to make it clear the West will not tolerate more aggression? Will the European Union wean itself off Russian fuel to deny Putin the means to fund his authoritarianism? Will the continue to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with its allies to counter Moscow? What we know from history is that wars change things: boundaries, governments, economies and cultures. The Ukraine war may stiffen the spine of the West to advance freedom and prosperity. Alternatively, it may create a black swan-like scenario that fades Ukrainian resiliency and Western help, whereas change favors Putin. At this point, the best advice for the armchair generals, is to avoid staking our policies on which way the war might go and how long – ""years,"" or end next month.",7,4.856821522156288,3.8995272176429805,0.9572943045133075,0

Last week, Russia's military started a seemingly relentless siege of the city, which, if it falls, would be Russia's biggest victory of the war. A few thousand Ukrainian fighters reportedly remain in the city. Capturing Mariupol would provide Russia direct access to the Sea of Azov, giving it routes to resupply and reignite its offensive strategy in Ukraine, specifically in the eastern Donbas region. It would also provide Russia a land corridor to the Crimean Peninsula, an area it seized from Ukraine in 2014.

2022-04-17,Fox,https://www.foxnews.com/us/us-army-using-lessons-from-ukraine-war-to-aid-own-training,US Army using lessons from Ukraine war to aid own training,"In the dusty California desert, U.S. Army trainers are already using lessons learned from Russia’s war against Ukraine as they prepare soldiers for future fights against a major adversary such as Russia or China. The role-players in this month’s exercise at the National Training Center speak Russian. The enemy force that controls the fictional town of Ujen is using a steady stream of social media posts to make false accusations against the American brigade preparing to attack. In the coming weeks, the planned training scenario for the next brigade coming in will focus on how to battle an enemy willing to destroy a city with rocket and missile fire in order to conquer it. , ' ': . If the images seem familiar, they are, playing out on televisions and websites worldwide right now as Russian forces pound Ukrainian cities with airstrikes, killing scores of civilians. The information war on social media has showcased impassioned nightly speeches by Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, as well as Russian efforts to accuse Ukraine’s forces of faking mass killings in towns such as Bucha – massacres that the West blames on Moscow’s troops. ""I think right now the whole Army is really looking at what’s happening in Ukraine and trying to learn lessons,"" said Army Secretary Christine Wormuth. Those lessons, she said, range from Russia’s equipment and logistics troubles to communications and use of the internet. Soldiers from the 2nd Brigade, 1st Cavalry Division, prepare an attack during an early morning training exercise at the National Training Center at Fort Irwin, California, April 12, 2022. ""The Russia-Ukraine experience is a very powerful illustration for our Army of how important the information domain is going to be,"" said Wormuth, who spent two days at the training center in the Mojave Desert watching an Army brigade wage war against the fictional ""Denovian"" forces. ""We’ve been talking about that for about five years. But really seeing it and seeing the way Zelenskyy has been incredibly powerful. ... This is a world war that the actual world can see and watch in real time. "" ' ': ' At the center, the commander, Brig. Gen. Curt Taylor, and his staff have ripped pages out of the Russian playbook to ensure that U.S. soldiers are ready to fight and win against a sophisticated near-peer enemy. It’s a common tool. For example, his base and the Joint Readiness Training Center in Louisiana both shifted to counterinsurgency training during the Iraq and Afghanistan wars. And the military services have focused other training on how to fight in cold weather – mimicking conditions in Russia or North Korea. But these latest changes have happened quickly in the early months after Russia invaded Ukraine. $800 , About 4,500 soldiers from 2nd Brigade, 1st Cavalry Division, based at Fort Hood, Texas, are out in the vast desert training area at Fort Irwin, where they will spend two weeks fighting the ’s resident 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment, which acts as the enemy military. Soldiers from the regiment – known as Blackhorse – are arrayed in and around Ujen, which also includes role-players acting as the locals. Army Secretary Christine Wormuth, right, talks with Army Col. Ian Palmer, commander of the 2nd Brigade, 1st Cavalry Division, at the National Training Center at Fort Irwin, California, April 12, 2022. As the sun was rising earlier this past week, Army Col. Ian Palmer, the brigade commander, stood on Crash Hill, on the outskirts of the town, preparing his soldiers to launch an attack. Lines of tanks spread out in the distance. Heavy winds the night before hampered his progress, so the attack was a bit behind. He said the exercise is using more drones by the friendly and enemy forces, both for surveillance and attacks. So his forces are trying to use camouflage and tuck into the terrain to stay out of sight. ""You know if you can be seen, you can be shot, wherever you are,"" he said. , Down in the makeshift town, the opposition forces are confident they can hold off Palmer’s brigade despite the size difference. The Denovians only have about 1,350 forces, but they are throwing everything they have at the brigade, from jamming and other electronic warfare to insurgency attacks and propaganda. The role-players have their phones ready to film and post quickly to social media. The Denovian forces want to portray the unit in the worst possible light, said Taylor, and constantly twist the narrative on social media so Palmer’s troops realize they are in a battle for the truth. Army Secretary Christine Wormuth is surrounded by soldiers at the National Training Center at Fort Irwin, California, April 12, 2022. That’s a challenge, he said, because ""when I’ve got a bunch of casualties and I’m getting overrun on my left flank and my supply trains aren’t where they need to be and I can’t find the bulldozers, it’s hard to think about something that someone said about me on Twitter."" The training goal, said Taylor, is teaching how to fuse all elements of combat power into a coordinated assault. ""Everyone can play an instrument, but it’s about making music – bringing it all together in a synchronized fashion. And what you saw today was the artillery was doing the artillery thing, the aviation was doing the aviation thing and the maneuver guys were doing the maneuver thing. But part of the delay in their assault on the town was they couldn’t synchronize those three,"" he said. Again, they can look to Ukraine to see how Russia failed to do that in the early weeks of the war. U.S. leaders repeatedly noted that, in Russia’s initial multipronged assault in Ukraine, commanders consistently failed to provide the airstrikes and support their ground troops needed to move into key cities such as Kyiv. , That failure led to Russian troops bombing the cities from the outskirts, hitting hospitals, apartment buildings and other structures, and killing civilians. So when the next brigade arrives at the training center, Taylor said it will face an enemy on board with doing just that. Brig. Gen. Curt Taylor and Army Secretary Christine Wormuth observe exercises at the National Training Center at Fort Irwin, California, April 12, 2022. ""We will be very focused on how to fight against an adversary that is willing to destroy infrastructure because that’s how we think our adversaries will fight,"" Taylor said. ""We’ve got to be prepared for urban combat where we have an adversary that is indiscriminately firing artillery."" Wormuth, the Army secretary, said seeing the training also underscored other lessons the U.S. is taking from the war in Ukraine. ""As we’re watching what’s happening to the Russians now, it’s informative for us to think about what is right, from a modernization standpoint,"" she said, noting that some U.S. tanks are very heavy and the terrain in Europe is muddier, not like the hard-packed sand of the desert.",7,5.134208412761609,5.164734766352422,-0.030526353590812683,26

Burns, speaking at the Georgia Institute of Technology Thursday in his first public speech as director, laid out a ""new era"" for the agency and an international landscape that is ""vastly different"" from the inception of the . ' ' 'S '' , ""It’s a more complicated and contested world, featuring the rise of an increasingly adversarial China and a pugnacious and revisionist Russia,"" Burns said, noting that the agency will ""have to reimagine itself to compete successfully in this new age."" Burns pointed to the ""immediate threat posed by renewed Russian aggression against Ukraine,"" and to the ""longer term problem posed by China’s ambitious leadership,"" calling it ""the single most important geopolitical challenge"" of the 21st century. ""A silent partner in Putin’s aggression, Xi Jinping’s China is our greatest challenge, in many ways the most profound test the has ever faced,"" Burns warned, calling the People’s Republic of China a ""formidable competitor lacking in neither ambition nor capability."" Director William Burns testifies during a House Intelligence Committee hearing about worldwide threats on Capitol Hill in Washington April 15, 2021. ""It seeks to overtake us in literally every domain, from economic strength to military power, and from space to cyberspace,"" he said, adding that China is ""intent"" on replacing the United States as ""the preeminent power in the Indo-Pacific."" ""As an intelligence service, we have never had to deal with an adversary with more reach in more domain,"" Burns said. The Biden administration has voiced ""deep concerns"" about Russia’s ""alignment"" with China. Intelligence officials said that the Kremlin had turned to Beijing for economic and military aid after its invasion of Ukraine Feb. 24. Last month, President Biden held a secure video call with Xi for nearly two hours during which he warned of the ""consequences"" should China ""provide material support"" to Russia amid its multi-front war on Ukraine. As for Russia’s war on Ukraine, Burns reflected on his career, having previously served as the U.S. ambassador in Moscow and his experience with Putin. , ' ' Chinese President Xi Jinping I Russian President Vladimir Putin | Photo by Mikhail Svetlov/Getty Images) ""His risk appetite has grown, as his grip on Russia has tightened,"" Burns said. ""His circle of advisers has narrowed. And in that small circle, it has never been career enhancing to question his judgement or his stubborn, almost mystical belief that his destiny is to restore Russia’s sphere of influence."" Burns said the began gathering intelligence about Putin’s plans for an invasion of Ukraine early last fall. ""In November, President Biden asked me to travel to Russia to convey directly to Putin and several of his closest advisors the depth of our concern about his planning for war and the consequences for Russia of attempting to execute that plan,"" Burns said, noting he was ""troubled"" by what he heard. ""While it did not yet seem that he had made an irreversible decision to invade Ukraine, Putin was defiantly leaning in that direction, apparently convinced that his window was closing for shaping Ukraine’s orientation,"" Burns said, adding that he ""seemed convinced"" that winter ""offered a favorable landscape."" Burns said Putin, at the time, thought it was ""unlikely"" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Ukrainians would ""mount effective resistance."" Upon launching his multi-front war in February, Putin was ""proven wrong,"" Burns added. As for U.S. intelligence amid Russia’s war on Ukraine, Burns said the administration has been ""committed to rapid and effective intelligence sharing with our Ukrainian partners throughout the fighting and for months beforehand."" ""As allied leaders and counterparts have emphasized directly in my travels to Europe, the credibility of U.S. intelligence helped cement the solidarity of the alliance at President Biden’s direction,"" Burns said, adding that the U.S. government has also ""taken unprecedented steps to declassify intelligence and use it publicly to preempt false narratives and false flag operations, which Putin has used so often in the past."" Russian President Vladimir Putin shakes hands with his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping at the Kremlin in Moscow, Russia, June 5, 2019. ""By being open with some of our secrets, we made it harder for Putin to obscure the truth of his unprovoked and vicious aggression,"" Burns said. ""Those decisions can never be taken lightly given the importance of protecting sources and methods, but, in this case, they have made a crucial contribution to a successful whole of government strategy."" Burns said it reflects ""the need for new thinking and new tactics in this new and demanding era for intelligence."" ""The last chapter in Putin’s war has yet to be written as he grinds away in Ukraine,"" Burns warned, saying that he has ""no doubt about the cruel pain and damage that Putin can continue to inflict on Ukraine or the raw brutality with which Russian force is being applied."" ' A ,' Burns said the ""crimes in Bucha are horrific,"" but that the ""Ukrainian will is unbroken."" ""Putin’s Russia has inflicted massive material and reputational damage on itself,"" Burns said. ""American intelligence has been vital throughout and offers valuable lessons for the future of our profession — how to develop good intelligence, use it as the basis for good policy, share it systematically as the basis for good alliances and partnerships, and deploy it openly and creatively to discredit the false narratives on which adversaries so often thrive."" A Ukrainian serviceman walks amid destroyed Russian tanks in Bucha on the outskirts of Kyiv, Ukraine. President Biden, this week, has classified actions by Russian forces in Bucha and throughout Ukraine as ""genocide,"" saying it has become ""clearer and clearer that Putin is just trying to wipe out even the idea of being Ukrainian."" ""The evidence is mounting,"" Biden told reporters. Biden's comments drew praise Tuesday from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who called the comments ""true words of a true leader."" ""Calling things by their names is essential to stand up to evil,"" Zelenskyy said on Twitter. ""We are grateful for assistance provided so far and we urgently need more heavy weapons to prevent further Russian atrocities."" Russia on Wednesday said Biden's comments were ""unacceptable."" : A cemetery worker waits in a truck before colleagues start to load corpses of civilians killed in Bucha before transporting them to a morgue on the outskirts of Kyiv, Ukraine. ""We consider this kind of effort to distort the situation unacceptable,"" Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said, according to Reuters. ""This is hardly acceptable from a president of the United States, a country that has committed well-known crimes in recent times,"" he added. In Ukraine, Human Rights Watch has documented evidence of summary executions, unlawful violence and threats against civilians and repeated rapes between Feb. 27 and March 14. A report from the organization also implicates Russian soldiers in looting civilian property, including food, clothing and firewood. The Senate last month approved a resolution to investigate Putin for war crimes, and Secretary of State Antony Blinken said U.S. findings will be used to help international efforts to hold the Kremlin accountable. $800 , Since the onslaught of the war Feb. 24, Russian forces have hit apartment buildings, children’s and maternity hospitals, bread lines and, most recently, a theater sheltering roughly 1,000 men, women and children in the besieged city of Mariupol. Russian forces have also been accused of using cluster munitions and vacuum bombs, which violate international law when used indiscriminately against civilians. The International Criminal Court said earlier this month it is opening an investigation into potential war crimes by Putin. Burns last year announced the formation of the ’s China Mission Center to counter Beijing. He also warned then that China poses ""the most important geopolitical threat"" to the United States in the 21st century. The addresses the challenges posed by the People’s Republic of China and emphasized last year, and again Thursday, that the ’s concern about the threat posed by the People’s Republic of China is ""not about the people of China, let alone fellow Americans of Chinese or Asian descent."" , ""It is a profound mistake to conflate the two,"" Burns said Thursday. ""At , we will stay sharply focused on the challenge."" Last month, the intelligence community annual threat assessment was released with data through January. It warned that China is increasingly a ""near-peer competitor, challenging the United States in multiple arenas —especially economically, militarily and technologically — and is pushing to change global norms and potentially threatening its neighbors."" President Biden spoke with Chinese President Xi Jingping in a video call March 18, 2022. As many have said, Putin’s invasion of Ukraine has emboldened China with regard to its ambition to take Taiwan. The intelligence community warned that Beijing is using a coordinated approach to compel neighbors to ""acquiesce"" to its preferences, ""including its territorial and maritime claims and assertions of sovereignty over Taiwan."" ""Beijing will press Taiwan to move toward unification and will react to what it views as increased U.S.–Taiwan engagement,"" the states. ""We expect that friction will grow as China continues to increase military activity around the island and Taiwan’s leaders resist Beijing’s pressure for progress toward unification."" The also assessed that China presents ""the broadest, most active, and persistent cyber espionage threat to U.S. Government and private sector networks."" ""China’s cyber pursuits and export of related technologies increase the threats of attacks against the U.S. homeland, suppression of U.S. web content that Beijing views as threatening to its control and the expansion of technology-driven authoritarianism globally,"" the report states. Beyond Russia and China, Burns said the is looking at the ""revolution in technology,"" which he said is transforming ""the way we live, work, compete and fight."" Burns said technology — like quantum computing and synthetic biology — is ""coming at a dizzying speed,"" while warning that ""familiar threats"" like terrorism and nuclear proliferation ""demand our attention."" But further committing to the mission of the , Burns declared that ""politics truly must stop where intelligence work begins."" ""In all that we do, we have an obligation to follow the law, which we take very seriously,"" Burns said.

2022-04-14,Fox,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/pentagon-ukraine-russia-rebecca-grant,Pentagon finally gets serious about helping Ukraine defeat Russia,"Pentagon Press Secretary John Kirby on Russia ramping up attacks on Ukrainian civilians. I can’t believe they had to wait so long. Finally, after 50 days of war, the new U.S. military assistance package announced by President Joe Biden Wednesday afternoon is providing Ukraine some American heavy artillery, 300 armored vehicles, and other equipment that will significantly boost Ukraine’s ability to take on the Russians. That’s an upgrade and about time. Based on the list of new weapons going to Ukraine, the Pentagon must see some serious Russian attacks coming. Evidently, somebody lit a fire under the Pentagon staff. Deliveries will ""literally start right away,"" pledged Pentagon spokesman John Kirby on Apr. 13. Pentagon Press Secretary John Kirby holds a news briefing at the Pentagon on March 09, 2022 in Arlington, Virginia. Kirby spoke on various topics including Russia’s invasion to Ukraine. Russia is concentrating combat power in the Donbas and ""time is of the essence,"" the Pentagon said. Looks to me like Russia wants to take Kramatorsk and other areas they held briefly in 2014, and to put the so-called ""People’s Republics"" in Donetsk and Luhansk under permanent Russian control. : This list is a serious commitment to taking on the second Russian offensive, including: * Eighteen 155 mm Howitzer long-range guns with 40,000 rounds of ammunition, which can destroy Russian strongpoints out to ten miles away. * Firefinder radars pinpoint Russian artillery sites based on incoming shelling. * The Sentinel radar tracks drones, cruise missiles, helicopters and planes for short-range air defense – in fact, it’s used to defend Washington, D.C., and it can get after Russian drones. * 100 Humvees and 200 armored personnel carriers will help Ukraine’s forces reposition in the block-to-block war for cities and highways * Eleven ex-Soviet Mi-17 helicopters will let Ukraine move people and equipment * More Javelin anti-tank weapons – hopefully the advanced model, with an adjustable warhead that can also defeat the explosive reactive armor of Russia’s more sophisticated tanks. I especially noticed the Claymore mines, which detonate on command and have a blast range of about 100 yards, are also on the list. Ukraine will set up select minefields to channel Russian forces and make Russian soldiers wary of leaving roads and vehicles. Remember this is Ukraine’s own land and they will keep charts of mine locations so they can pull them out later. For some reason, the U.S. and have decided Ukraine has to beat Russia without using much airpower. This is not how the U.S. and fight. And 100 of the Switchblade attack drones first promised Mar. 16 are finally in Ukraine, with more on the way. ' ' Putin has threatened to attack arms shipments, but the fact is road, rail and air supply routes from the west are open. The equipment list also doesn’t tell the whole story. The U.S. has been sharing ""extraordinary"" intelligence and surveillance with Ukraine, to use Joint Chiefs Chairman Mark Milley’s term. Details are scant, but this probably includes satellite pictures, signals intelligence and drone tracking to help Ukraine’s forces find, fix and target the Russians. It’s a huge advantage and one of the best things the U.S. can do for Ukraine right now. Of course, there’s still one big problem. Where’s the airpower? It’s not just the MiG-29s.

President Biden says he’s allotted $2.6 billion worth of security assistance to Ukraine just since Feb. 24. That’s a lot of money, but don’t forget Congress authorized $14 billion, which Biden’s barely tapped. Still, this is a welcome change of pace for the Pentagon. Few expected Ukraine to fight so well when the war began Feb. 24. For weeks, the Pentagon was in reaction mode, instead of thinking ahead for a big war and the demands for weapons and resupply.

The president on Tuesday called the actions of Russian forces in Ukraine a ""genocide"" for the first time on Tuesday— a characterization he had previously shied away from using. ‘,' '' When pressed on whether he misspoke, or if his comments were planned, White House press secretary Jen Psaki replied: ""He is the president of the United States and the leader of the free world, and he is allowed to make his views known at any point he would like."" When asked again, Psaki quipped: ""I think we shouldn’t misunderstand who he is and where he stands in the totem pole—which is at the top."" Biden, on Tuesday, called actions by Russian forces in Ukraine a ""genocide,"" explaining that he did so ""because it’s become clearer and clearer that Putin is just trying to wipe out even the idea of being Ukrainian."" ""The evidence is mounting,"" Biden told reporters after appearing to reference the term earlier Tuesday. In comments on inflation earlier Tuesday, Biden said that the prices Americans pay shouldn't depend on whether a dictator ""commits genocide"" against another country, an apparent shot at Russian President Vladimir Putin and his decision to invade Ukraine. ""We’ll let the lawyers decide, internationally, whether or not it qualifies,"" Biden later clarified in his answer to reporters in Iowa, ""but it sure seems that way to me."" $800 , Biden's comments drew praise from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy Tuesday, calling the comments ""true words of a true leader.""

Biden’s comments come after last week he referred to Russia’s actions in Ukraine as ""war crimes"" instead of genocide. Zelenskyy had first referred to the atrocities in the country as genocide earlier his month. Biden’s comments come after he was asked last week if he he agreed with Zelenskyy's characterization of ""genocide."" ""No, I think it is a war crime,"" Biden said. , '' But Tuesday, the president said that ""more evidence is coming out of literally the horrible things that the Russians have done to Ukraine.""

Russia, on Wednesday, though, said Biden's comments were ""unacceptable."" ""We consider this kind of effort to distort the situation unacceptable,"" Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said, according to Reuters. ""This is hardly acceptable from a president of the United States, a country that has committed well-known crimes in recent times,"" he added. Human Rights Watch has documented evidence of summary executions, unlawful violence and threats against civilians, and repeated rapes between Feb. 27 and March 14. A report from the organization also implicates Russian soldiers in looting civilian property, including food, clothing and firewood. The Senate, last month, approved a resolution that will investigate Putin for war crimes, and Blinken said U.S. findings will be used to help international efforts to hold the Kremlin accountable. Since the onslaught of the war on Feb. 24, Russian forces have hit apartment buildings, children’s and maternity hospitals, bread lines and most recently a theater that was sheltering roughly 1,000 men, women and children in the besieged city of Mariupol. Russian forces have also been accused of using cluster munitions and vacuum bombs in the war, which violate international law when used indiscriminately against civilians.

Mizintsev said that the foreign operatives are attempting to spread disinformation about Russia and lay the groundwork to accuse its forces of war crimes. 10,000 Russian President Vladimir Putin But Rebekah Koffler, author of ""Putin's Playbook"" and former intelligence officer focused on Russia, believes the declaration by Mizintsev is an attempt by Russia to launch its own disinformation campaign as a way to cover for potential crimes committed in Ukraine. ""This statement is almost certainly Russia’s own disinformation campaign intended to hide Russia’s hand in the atrocities that have been, are being and will be conducted in the coming weeks by the Russian forces in Ukraine,"" Koffler said. ""The goal is to blame Ukraine in order to confuse Western audience about who exactly commits brutality in Ukraine."" Mizintsev claimed that the psychological influence campaign is being run out of non-commercial organizations such as the International Commission for Missing Persons, which was stood up by the United States, with the French government providing members of its military and police to the effort. He went on to say that these specialists would then be conducting investigations into alleged war crimes committed by Russia, which were likely to be biased against Russia. President Biden But Koffler believes that Mizintsev's statement is a Russian attempt to cause confusion ahead of its offensive, with intelligence indicating that its forces are likely to more heavily target civilians in the coming weeks. ""Intelligence indicates that Russia will escalate the level of atrocities, targeting civilians and employing scorched earth tactics in the next 3-4 weeks as Putin is rushing to wrap up the active combat phase of operations in Ukraine,"" Koffler said. ""Given Putin’s recent appointment of Gen. Aleksandr Dvornikov to take over command Russian forces, use of chemical weapons cannot be ruled out."" Koffler noted that Russia runs ""disinformation operations"" and ""strategic deception"" hand-in-hand with its military operations, which in this case will be used in an attempt to discredit Western claims of Russian war crimes. The statement comes as Russian authorities in the contested Donbas region have declared an elevated terrorist threat level, claiming that there is a high risk of attacks by Ukrainian nationalists. Koffler believes such warnings are part of Russia's disinformation campaign, opening up the possibility for them to justify an offensive in the region.

Boychenko said Ukrainians have been at the camps for weeks. ""Filtration is very strict - fingerprints are taken, as well as biometrics. They force people to sign various documents,"" he described, according to a translation by a Ukrainian news agency. The mayor noted that government employees have been treated particularly harshly.

A western official told the outlet that the change in command will improve Russia’s flagging invasion after it failed to take the capital city of Kyiv despite weeks of shelling and attempts to push ground forces across the country. ""Unless Russia is able to change its tactics, it's very difficult to see how they succeed in even these limited objectives that they've reset themselves,"" the official said. But Russia has made greater advances in the south and east of Ukraine – an advancement that senior U.S. defense officials have said is largely due to its illegal eight-year occupation of areas like Crimea. Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg warned this week that Russia is looking to focus its efforts on a ""major offensive"" in eastern Ukraine, where Russian-backed forces have been fighting the Ukrainian army since 2014 in the self-proclaimed Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republics.

2022-04-08,Fox,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/ukraine-war-russia-michael-waltz,It's time to help Ukraine win this war,"Rep. Michael Waltz, R-Fla., calls for more sophisticated weapons and training for Ukrainian forces and responds to Jen Psaki's pushback against Florida's Parental Rights in Education law. Ukraine has shocked the world with a valiant defense of its country. Rather than swiftly take the Ukrainian capital Kyiv, as Russia had anticipated and our own defense department believed, the Ukrainian military has brought the Russian military to a standstill across the country. Even at times, the Ukrainian military has forced the Russia into retreat and retaken occupied territory. ‘’ A Ukrainian serviceman walks by a destroyed apartment building in Borodyanka, Ukraine, Wednesday, April 6, 2022. Ukrainian authorities gathered their dead and collected evidence of Russian atrocities on the ruined outskirts of Kyiv, as the two sides geared up Wednesday for what could be a climactic push by Moscow's forces to seize the country's industrial east. Vladimir Putin has staked his legacy on this invasion. Desperate, he has resorted to despicable war crimes by launching strikes against children’s hospitals, civilian centers, and executing civilians without cause. We’ve helped the Ukrainians defend themselves against this invasion. It’s now time we help them go on offense to retake the Russian occupied parts of Ukraine. Dwight Eisenhower once declared ""guns and tanks and planes are nothing unless there is a solid spirit, a solid heart, and great productiveness behind it."" The Ukrainian people have shown spirit, heart, and productiveness. They now need all the guns, tanks, and planes capable to defeat Russia militarily, and retake Crimea and the Donbas to restore their borders. For months, the Biden administration has balked at the notion of providing ‘offensive’ arms that could be deemed too escalatory and invite further aggression for Putin. It needs to end the notion of only providing ‘defensive’ weaponry. According to reports, Ukrainian helicopters recently attacked a Russian fuel depot and demonstrated the capability to strike targets in Russia. They should be given the capabilities to continue those cross-border missions. While the U.S. has belatedly provided much-needed arms, such as stingers and javelins to defend against Russian aircraft and tanks, and now is the time to help them advance against Russian military. Russia continues to carry out strikes against Ukraine’s pivotal coastal city of Odesa – their lifeline to the Black Sea – and need the capabilities to defend against a Russian advancement on a key economic port. The Biden administration needs to provide Harpoon anti-ship missiles to do just that. Additionally, Ukrainian pilots are trained to use Soviet-era MiG aircraft to maintain control over their airspace. They have the personnel to fly these aircraft without prior training and MiGs would provide an immediate boost to their defense posture but also provide air cover for future Ukrainian army advances. Send Ukraine the damn MiGs. Every day that passes without vital equipment, more civilians are dying. Earlier this week, Secretary of Defense Austin and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs General Milley told me in a Congressional hearing that we are providing training to Ukrainian forces, despite Supreme Allied Commander General Wolters telling me the previous week we were not. Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, testifies before the House Armed Services Committee on the conclusion of military operations in Afghanistan, Wednesday, Sept. 29, 2021, on Capitol Hill in Washington. In response to an Associated Press investigation that showed some stolen military guns were used in street crimes, Milley ordered the armed services to report a detailed accounting of missing firearms and explosives, which his office shared privately with Capitol Hill. We cannot send these mixed signals to the world as it weakens our public commitment to helping Ukraine defend themselves. The Biden Administration should very publicly commit to training Ukrainian forces as a means to signal to the Russian military that this war will be a long quagmire, draining Russia of blood and treasure. At this point, Russia needs to know this is a conflict that won’t just drag out, but one that it will ultimately lose. The Biden administration can still use additional tools to further cripple the Russian economy and isolate them diplomatically. Russia is currently relying on China to avoid international sanctions – we should be imposing secondary sanctions on China to close off these loopholes. - President Joe Biden speaks in the State Dining Room of the White House, Friday, April 1, 2022, in Washington. A federal appeals court on Thursday, April 7, has upheld Biden’s requirement that all federal employees be vaccinated against -19. President Biden can also fully sever Russia’s ties from which would disable Russia’s ability to access international banking as it relates to their energy sector. These economic actions will further diminish Putin of much-needed resources to fund his military assault. The decision enter into a peace agreement with Russia lays solely with the Ukrainian people. But until that time, the international community needs to send a diplomatic message to Russia that they will no longer be permitted to use international organizations to spread their propaganda. This includes removing Russia from the Security Council. I’ve cosponsored legislation to establish a lend-lease program to simplify bureaucratic barriers and allow a speedier transfer of U.S. military equipment to Ukraine. This World War -era program was used to assist allies in the war effort and can be used again to help Ukraine. The Senate has passed legislation to do this and Speaker Nancy Pelosi should allow a vote on this legislation immediately. When this conflict is over, lawmakers will assess what we could have done more to help Ukraine. They should have been provided arms months ago. General Milley conceded to me ""The more [stingers] that they had prior to the invasion, the better off the would have been.""

The official said the Pentagon has seen ""indications"" that Russia is looking to launch a ""mobilization phase"" as it refits soldiers in Russia and Belarus. Vitaly, 52, says he is of Russian origin and fought in the Russian army during the first Chechen war but fights alongside Ukrainian soldiers Feb. 9, 2022, in Pisky, Ukraine. ' ' , ' ' Moscow said last week that, in a show of good faith, it would remove troops from areas around the capital city of Kyiv and the northern city of Chernihiv.

But the senior U.S. defense official also noted that there have not been any ""indications that there are fresh reinforcements."" The official said the U.S. is not seeing strong evidence that the soldiers who could be recruited to replenish the Russian troops will be ""fully trained, fully armed"" or even ""fully ready"" to enter the war. It is unclear how many Russian troops have been killed since the onslaught of the war more than six weeks ago, but Russian spokesman Dmitry Peskov said in an interview Thursday with Sky News that Moscow has seen ""significant losses of [its] troops."" Peskov did not provide a figure on the number of Russian causalities, but the Kremlin put the number close to 1,350 deaths in late March.

After initial gains, the Russian militarys southern advance has met resistance in Mariupol, Ukraines easternmost port city, and Mykolayiv, the gateway to Odesa in the west, where the wide Bug river estuary makes a natural defensive barrier. Radio Free Europe in December first reported on Moscow’s plans to standardize wartime mass grave practices, but it was only last week that those plans took on a new light: The standards apply to the ""emergency burial"" of fallen soldiers, with a specific size that would hold up to 1,000 bodies, as well as how to arrange the bodies and how to cover them. Some experts argued that the size of mass graves ""are thinkable only for a nuclear war or a pandemic."" Gary Kasparov, former world chess champion and chairman of the Human Rights Foundation, referred to the standardization as one of the ""signposts on the way to the apocalypse."" ‘, ’ , The standards went into effect on Feb. 1, 2022, just weeks before the invasion started, but residents in Russia heard about the standardization initiative ""in the early days of December."" Galya Morrell, a Russian and American citizen currently residing in the U.S., told Fox News Digital that she read chats at the time discussing the new standards and how people speculated on the range of reasons to make such a move at the time. Morrell said the bulk of speculation related to conspiracy theories, such as the graves serving to bury vaccinated individuals or to cover up cases of Siberian anthrax. Others believed it was a case of corruption meant to redistribute the funeral market. But Morrell saw it as a clear sign that Putin meant to go as far as needed in Ukraine – including the use of weapons of mass destruction. Morrell said standards noted that ""bodies with a high radiation background would be buried in a specially-designated area."" , ""For me, it was the last drop,"" Morrell, who was in Siberia at the time, said. ""While watching the accumulation of Russian troops on the Ukrainian border, I still had some hopes that this is just a tactical method of diplomacy, this time I thought that such losses, in which digging mass graves for civilian population may be necessary, could only be mean one thing: the use of weapons of mass destruction, whether chemical or nuclear."" Anderson argued that it is hard to draw a line from the mass grave initiative to ""what we’re seeing now in Ukraine,"" and he reiterated the value of using it to raise greater resources for Ukraine months ahead of time. ""It could have provided – not that it might have deterred Putin from invading – but it could have provided Ukraine more warning time to prepare itself for the invasion,"" Anderson said.

The Ukrainian government on Thursday released what they claimed were intercepted radio recordings of a Russian commander instructing his soldiers to ""take out"" Ukrainian civilians in Mariupol. The Times of London reported Thursday about the obscenity-strewn recordings released by the Security Service of Ukraine. In one recording, an unidentified Russian soldier says he observed ""two people coming out of the grove in civilian [clothing]."" He also spotted a vehicle and states he cannot determine whether it’s a civilian vehicle or one operating by members of the Ukrainian military.

2022-04-07,Fox,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/milley-ukraine-war-prediction-james-jay-carafano,Why Gen. Milley's Ukraine war prediction missed by a mile,"National security correspondent Jennifer Griffin has the latest from the Pentagon on 'Special Report.' Shortly before Russian President Vladimir Putin launched his latest invasion of Ukraine, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Mark Milley, reportedly told congressional leaders meeting in closed session that the smaller country would ""fall in 72 hours."" Welp, here we are, well over a month into that three-day war. So how did the principal military advisor to the president of the United States get it so wrong? 'S ‘72 ’ Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Mark Milley listens during a media briefing at the Pentagon, Friday, Jan. 28, 2022, in Washington. Perhaps, Milley forgot the most important military adage of all: ""No plan survives contact with the enemy."" Give the Pentagon its due. U.S. military analysts correctly anticipated the broad strokes of Putin’s initial battle plan: strike from the north to decapitate the government in Kiev, while launching a sweeping multi-prong attack from the south and the east. The Kremlin’s expectation was that when Ukrainians found themselves leaderless and overmatched, the country’s armed forces and its people would not put up much of a fight. After that, it would be merely a matter of occupation and annexation. Looking at the volume and disposition of Russian forces arrayed on Ukraine’s borders many analysts—not just those at the Pentagon—agreed that a swift Russian victory was certainly possible… if Putin decided to pull the trigger. Russian President Vladimir Putin attends a meeting of the Supreme Eurasian Economic Council in Yerevan, Armenia. And, if everything had gone right for Putin, people today might be toasting Milley as a military Nostradamus. But, as if often the case in war, once the shooting starts the dogs of war scatter in all kinds of unpredictable ways. A reasonable issue to raise is: Why didn’t Milley better prepare us for that? The best military advice is not a simple prediction of what will happen; it’s a matter of preparing to respond to the terrible turns—and take advantage of the spectacular opportunities—that were not predicted. Milley’s misjudgment raises two serious concerns. First, where were the comprehensive assessments of Russian military capabilities? In the 1980s, the Pentagon’s Office of Net Assessment under the legendary leadership of Andrew Marshall pioneered an analysis of enemy forces that looked at all the factors that affect combat power--everything from the state of training and supplies to the quality of equipment. This yielded a far more sophisticated analysis than the simplistic ""correlation of forces"" comparisons that counted how many tanks, planes, and troops each side had. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin speaks during a media briefing at the Pentagon, Friday, Jan. 28, 2022, in Washington. Where is that quality of analysis now? With the benefit of hindsight, we know that part of Putin’s problem is that the Ukrainians didn’t follow his plan and collapse like they were supposed to. But we now have lots of evidence that the Russian military itself is riddled with shortcomings, from inadequate training to poor leadership, corruption, and significant shortfalls in some critical capabilities—particularly secure communications and real-time intelligence, surveillance, and targeting. How deep were U.S. military assessments beyond looking at Putin’s plans? How much was shared with the White House or Congress or the allies or Ukraine? Beyond that, how much did the Pentagon explore the real serious stuff of military analysis and planning: what happens when what is most expected doesn’t happen? Did they prepare the contingency plans for a variety of possible scenarios? Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, testifies before the House Armed Services Committee on the conclusion of military operations in Afghanistan, Wednesday, Sept. 29, 2021, on Capitol Hill in Washington. In response to an Associated Press investigation that showed some stolen military guns were used in street crimes, Milley ordered the armed services to report a detailed accounting of missing firearms and explosives, which his office shared privately with Capitol Hill. From all appearances, there was little impulse to do that before the conflict. When war did break out, there seemed a reluctance to do much because the outcome was foretold. Then, as the battle lengthened, the administration proved reluctant to do more to aid Ukraine out of fear Putin would see that as escalatory. Only once it was clear Putin wasn’t winning on the battlefield, did the Pentagon acknowledge that this could be a long-protracted war, and only then did they lean forward into wanting to do more. This sure looks reacting to the course of events rather thinking ahead on how to make the most of them. Our military seems to have lost some of the skills that have made us so formidable. This pathology isn’t new. It reminds exactly of when the U.S. went into the Iraq War, was surprised by the turmoil that followed, and found itself lodged in a long, tough and messy fight to catch up. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark A. Milley testifies before a House Armed Services Committee hearing on the conclusion of military operations in Afghanistan at the Rayburn House Office building on Capitol Hill on September 29, 2021 in Washington, D.C. Here is the problem. The U.S. military is famous for learning from mistakes and doing better next time. That is not happening. How far have we come since Iraq? We fumbled the ball in the Afghanistan withdrawal. Now, we’re struggling to keep up again. What happens next time, when it’s Taiwan being invaded by China or some other crisis? Here is what’s different. Over the Obama years, we have a grown a different generation of senior of military officers who seem less prepared to deal with the hard realities of real wars and real military missions. This is not to question their patriotism or their professionalism. There is a question, however, as to whether they are up to the challenge of managing civil-military relations effectively, in advising and supporting a Congress and a president on how best to protect America’s interests. Both Afghanistan and Ukraine have shown we have a weak commander-in-chief. Do we have weak senior military leaders to match?",7,4.624126521172051,5.0855342879954915,-0.46140776682344065,0

""Russia’s top leadership ordered the destruction of any evidence of crimes committed by its army in Mariupol,"" the council added in a translated statement, accusing Moscow of reacting to widespread condemnation over mass civilian killings in Bucha. Humanitarian access to the city has been blocked for weeks, with an estimated 160,000 residents unable to evacuate and lacking access to electricity, heating, health care and water, reported the U.K.’s Ministry of Defense. Mariupol officials have estimated that roughly 5,000 civilians had been killed, but warned Wednesday that given the size of the destruction caused to the city the death toll could be in the tens of thousands.

""The time will come when every Russian will learn the whole truth about who among their fellow citizens killed, who gave orders, who turned a blind eye to the murders,"" he said. Among the dead was the mayor of the village of Motyzhyn, Olga Sukhenko, her husband and her adult son, whose tortured bodies were found in a shallow grave on a plot of land near houses used as makeshift barracks by occupying Russian troops, according to Ukrainian officials. The three of them reportedly had been kidnaped by Russian forces days before. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov dismissed the scenes outside Kyiv as a ""stage-managed anti-Russian provocation."" Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said the images contained ""signs of video forgery and various fakes."" Russia has rejected previous allegations of atrocities as fabrications by Ukraine. In an initial count Sunday, Ukrainian prosecutor-general’s office said the bodies of at least 410 civilians have been found in towns around Kyiv that were recaptured from Russian forces, describing one room discovered in Bucha as a ""torture chamber."" In a statement, it said the bodies of five men with their hands bound were found in the basement of a children’s sanatorium where civilians were tortured and killed. The bodies seen by journalists in Bucha included at least 13 in and around a building that local people said Russian troops used as a base. Three other bodies were found in a stairwell, and a group of six were burned together. The dead witnessed by the news agency's journalists also included bodies wrapped in black plastic, piled on one end of a mass grave in a Bucha churchyard. Many of those victims had been shot in cars or killed in explosions trying to flee the city. About two-thirds of the Russian troops around Kyiv have left and are either in Belarus or on their way there, probably getting more supplies and reinforcements, said a senior U.S. defense official who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss an intelligence assessment. More than 1,500 civilians were able to escape Mariupol on Monday, using the dwindling number of private vehicles available to leave, Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said. The besieged southern port city has seen some of the heaviest fighting of the war. But amid the fighting, a Red Cross-accompanied convoy of buses that has been thwarted for days on end in a bid to deliver supplies and evacuate residents was again unable to get inside the city, Vereshchuk said.

Appearing somber and at times visibly emotional, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy paid a visit to the town of Bucha outside of the capital of Kyiv Monday after disturbing images surfaced showing the bodies of civilians tortured and killed as Russian troops pulled back in recent days. ""First of all, it’s very important to us that the press is here and there are journalists,"" Zelenskyy told reporters in Bucha on Monday. ""We want you to show the world what was happening here, what the Russian military was doing, what the Russian regime was doing.""

""These are war crimes and need to be recognized by the world as genocide."" Shortly after Zelenskyy visit to Bucha, President Biden called for a war crimes trial against Russia President Vladimir Putin and said he’d seek more sanctions after reported atrocities in Ukraine. But, speaking to reporters in Washington, D.C., he stopped short of categorizing the actions as genocide. ""You saw what happened in Bucha,"" Biden said, describing Putin as both ""brutal"" and a ""war criminal."" ""What’s happening in Bucha is outrageous and everyone sees it."" Meanwhile, Biden's chief envoy to the United Nations, Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield, announced Monday that the U.S. plans to seek a suspension of Russia from its seat on the U.N.’s top human rights body in the wake of more indications Russian forces may have committed war crimes in Ukraine.

Bucha Mayor Anatoly Fedoruk estimated to The Washington Post that about 270 civilians had been buried in mass graves in his town, while another some 40 were lying dead in streets, some with their hands bound and showing signs of torture. Associated Press journalists said they saw the bodies of at least 21 people in various spots around Bucha, northwest of the capital. In Motyzhyn, to the west of Kyiv, journalists also said they saw the bodies of four people who appeared to have been shot at close range and thrown into a pit. Residents said the mayor, her son and her husband — who had been bound and blindfolded — were among them. ""The longer the Russian Federation delays the meeting the process, the worse it will be for them,"" Zelenskyy said Monday. ""Because everyday when our troops reenter and de-occupy certain territories, you see what’s happening. It’s very difficult to talk when you see what they’ve done here and everyday you understand there are people in barrels, in cellars, strangled and simply tortured."" Ukrainian Lesia Vasylenko tweeted that among the victims found dead in Bucha were 10-year-old girls found with vaginal and rectal tears and women with swastika shaped burns on their bodies. ""Russian Men did this,"" she wrote. ""And Russian mothers raised them. A nation of immoral criminals."" According to The Kyiv Independent, the Ukrainian Defense Ministry’s Intelligence Directorate published a list of Russian military serving in the 64th Motor Rifle Brigade which occupied Bucha until March 31. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, the European Commission president, tweeted Monday that the European Union will send investigators to Ukraine to help the local prosecutor general ""document war crimes."" Biden noted that he faced push back last month when he described Putin as a war criminal for the unfolding onslaught in Ukraine after hospitals and maternity wards were bombed. ""It is about life and people being killed, tortured – all of these stories of ‘let’s wait until there’s a trial, which will be very slow, we will press on publicly as much as we can,"" Zelenskyy said Monday. ""We will not make any pause to find all the criminals and from that, it will basically help civilization."" Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov dismissed the scenes outside Kyiv as a ""stage-managed anti-Russian provocation."" The Kremlin has repeatedly rejected allegations of atrocities as fakery on Ukraine's part. Lavrov said the mayor of Bucha made no mention of atrocities a day after Russian troops left last week, but two days later scores of bodies were photographed scattered in the streets. Investigations into Putin’s actions had begun before the new allegations of atrocities outside Kyiv. The U.S. and more than 40 other countries are working together to investigate possible violations and abuses, after the passage of a resolution by the United Nations Human Rights Council to establish a commission of inquiry.

With both sides regrouping as Russia bombs cities, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Joe Biden and Vladimir Putin all face big choices. First, Zelenskyy: Should the Ukrainian president counterattack or give up territory to get a cease-fire? Zelenskyy said the war is at a ""turning point"" in a March 30 video. He needs more equipment to wage multiple fights to push Russia back. Right now, Ukraine is counterattacking several sites, including Kherson, which Russia took March 2. The big dilemma is Mariupol. If Ukraine can stall Russia there, Zelenskyy would score another major victory. Zelenskyy has said since 2019 that he won’t give up territory to Russia. His choices depend on whether Ukraine’s people can hold on as ground forces fight back. ""I don’t believe in any negotiation with Russia, ever,"" Sgt. Anton Kolumbet of Ukraine’s army told the Washington Post on Thursday. ""The only language that Russia understands is the language of force."" , Adding to that resolve, on the ground the military forecast for Ukraine is not bad. Supreme Allied Commander Gen. Tod Wolters said March 29 that Ukraine’s forces learn fast and can ""inflict more stalling"" on Russia. He and Gen, Jacqueline von Ovost, head of U.S. Transportation Command, told Congress the Ukraine supply routes have not been hit so far, Russia hasn’t disrupted Ukraine’s command and control of its forces, and even Russia’s best tanks have ""chinks in their armor"" when Ukraine employs the right tactics. It’s a shame Biden and still have no clear strategy to help Ukraine win. On Thursday, Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said the U.S. wants Ukraine to win. Biden has yet to declare that policy. Face it, the White House has been in reaction mode all along. Advisers like Gen. Mark Milley said in February that Kyiv could fall in five days. That’s why Team Biden evacuated the U.S. embassy and infamously offered Zelenskyy a ride out of his own country. Sadly, White House fear of Russian escalation is stifling development of a new strategy for the next phase of the war. Team Biden’s plan was to stick with sanctions and the campaign of canny, anti-Russia intelligence leaks on false flags, the plan to catch Zelenskyy, protest letters to Putin, and this week’s entries, the claims that Russian soldiers are sabotaging their own weapons while defense officials aren’t telling Putin he’s losing the war. All that’s fine, but it’s kept Team Biden from intensifying military assistance to help Ukraine win the war. That means improved air defenses, faster munitions delivery, and probably some tactical coaching and surveillance help, too. Sadly, White House fear of Russian escalation is stifling development of a new strategy for the next phase of the war. Remember Biden is all emotions and no statesmanship. Then there is Putin. His plan to topple Zelenskyy and break up Ukraine into puppet ""People’s Republics"" failed. Unfortunately, Putin still has over 150,000 forces in Ukraine and several vicious options to continue the war. Russia can bomb Ukraine’s cities for a long time to pressure Zelenskyy. The Pentagon says they have the ""vast majority"" of their bomb and missile inventory still intact. Already Russia is flying 300 sorties per day against Ukraine, up 50% from two weeks ago. Of course, Putin could escalate with terror weapons. But I think that from a military perspective, the risks of Russian escalation are going down, not up. has more forces ready to react if Russia strikes west. As Russia moves the fight east, Putin can’t easily use nuclear weapons there; the radiation will blow back into Russia. Crude chemical weapons, such as the barrel-bomb attacks seen in Syria, won’t yield tactical results. Watch for Russia to ramp up the ground war. Russian spokesmen said they will focus on the Donbas. Russia may still be hampered by the stodgy command and control that slowed its Kyiv advance but fighting near its own borders could reduce logistics problems. Mercenaries from the Wagner Group will join other Russian reinforcements. Don’t forget there are actual trenches in parts of the Donbass. The best way to bring peace is through Ukraine’s defeat of Russia on the battlefield. It can’t be done without more of America’s help.",7,4.7624918570213675,4.6870406499883,0.07545120703306729,0

Associated Press journalists in Bucha, a small city northwest of Kyiv, saw the bodies of at least nine people in civilian clothes who appeared to have been killed at close range. At least two had their hands tied behind their backs. The also saw two bodies wrapped in plastic, bound with tape and thrown into a ditch. Authorities said they were documenting evidence as Ukraine’s military reclaims territory and discovers indications of execution-style slayings to add to their case for prosecuting Russian officials for war crimes. - ' ': Oleksiy Arestovych, an adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said scores of killed civilians were found on the streets of Bucha and the Kyiv suburbs of Irpin and Hostomel in what looked like a ""scene from a horror movie."" Arestovych said some people were shot in the head and had their hands bound, and some bodies showed signs of torture, rape and burning. The capital city’s mayor, Vitali Klitschko, said civilians were ""shot with joined hands"" and told German newspaper Bild that ""what happened in Bucha and other suburbs of Kyiv can only be described as genocide."" Ukrainian servicemen climb on a fighting vehicle outside Kyiv, Ukraine, Saturday, April 2, 2022. A day earlier, journalists witnessed Ukrainian soldiers gingerly removing at least six bodies from a street in Bucha with cables in case the Russians had booby-trapped corpses with explosives before their withdrawal. Local residents said the dead people were civilians killed without provocation, a claim that could not be independently verified. Klitschko called on other nations to immediately end Russian gas imports, saying they were funding the invasion of Ukraine, now in its 39th day. ""Not a penny should go to Russia anymore. That’s bloody money used to slaughter people. The gas and oil embargo must come immediately,"" the mayor said. - Charles Michel, president of the European Council, wrote on Twitter that he was shocked by the ""haunting images of atrocities committed by Russian army"" in the capital region. The and non-governmental organizations were assisting in the effort to preserve evidence of war crimes, according to Michel, who promised ""further sanctions"" against Russia. On Sunday morning, Russian forces launched an airstrike on the Black Sea port of Odesa, in southern Ukraine, sending up clouds of dark smoke that veiled parts of the city. The Russian military said the targets were an oil processing plant and fuel depots around Odesa, which is Ukraine’s largest port and home to its navy. ""I live in that eight-floor building. At 6 in the morning, Russia launched an attack, and this piece of rock reached my house,"" said Maiesienko Ilia, who lives near one of the targeted facilities. People watch as smoke rises after shelling in Odesa, Ukraine, Sunday, April 3, 2022. The Odesa city council said Ukraine’s air defense shot down some missiles before they hit the city. Ukrainian military spokesman Vladyslav Nazarov said there were no casualties from the attack. The smaller port of Mariupol, located to the east on the Sea of Azov, remained cut off from the rest of the country as Russian and Ukrainian soldiers fought for control of the besieged city. About 100,000 civilians – less than a quarter of the prewar population of 430,000 – are believed to be trapped there with little or no food, water, fuel and medicine, The International Committee of the Red Cross said it hoped a team of nine staffers and three vehicles it sent Saturday to help evacuate residents would reach Mariupol on Sunday but cautioned, ""The situation on the ground is volatile and subject to rapid changes."" Ukrainian authorities said Russia agreed days ago to allow safe passage from the city, which has been the site of some of the worst attacks and greatest suffering, but similar agreements have broken down repeatedly under continued shelling. Mariupol is in the mostly Russian-speaking Donbas region, where Moscow-backed separatists have fought Ukrainian troops for eight years. Its capture would create an unbroken land corridor from Russia to Crimea, which Moscow seized from Ukraine in 2014. With Mariupol squarely in Russia’s crosshairs, Ukraine insisted it had gained a leg up elsewhere in the country. As his country’s troops retook territory north of the capital of Kyiv from departing Russian troops, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called on all Ukrainians to do whatever they could ""to foil the enemy’s tactics and weaken its capabilities.""

There is no need to entertain empty hopes that they will simply leave our land. We can only have peace by fighting,"" Zelenskyy said late Saturday. Zelenskyy and Ukraine’s Western allies believe Russia has shifted its forces from the capital region and the country’s north in order to build strength in the east and south. The Ukrainian leader again urged the West to supply his military with warplanes and more anti-missile systems. ""Every Russian missile that hits our cities and every bomb dropped on our people, on our children, only adds black paint to the history that will describe everyone on whom the decision depended – the decision of whether to help Ukraine with modern weapons,"" Zelenskyy said. 'S ' ' While the geography of the battlefield morphed, little changed for many Ukrainians more than five weeks into a war that has sent more than 4 million people fleeing the country as refugees and displaced millions more from their homes. The regional governor in Kharkiv, said Sunday that Russian artillery and tanks performed over 20 strikes on Ukraine’s second-largest city and its outskirts in the country’s northeast over the past day. Gov. Oleh Synyehubov said a missile strike on the city of Lozovo wounded four people and that Russian tanks bombarded a hospital in the town of Balakliia. Zelenskyy alleged Saturday that Russian troops have left mines around homes, abandoned equipment and even the bodies of the dead as they withdraw from around Kyiv. Those claims could not be independently verified, but Ukrainian troops were seen heeding the warning.

Ukraine and Western allies have reported mounting evidence of Russia withdrawing its forces from around Kyiv and sending troops to eastern Ukraine. Officials said Ukraine's fighters had reclaimed several areas near its capital city, including the city of Brovary. However, the shift does not mean the country faces a reprieve from the war. The New York Times reported Saturday that Russian forces moved to crack down on protesters in the southeastern of city Enerhodar, which is home to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant.

Ukraine’s state nuclear agency, Energoatom, reported about the attacks on its official Telegram channel, posting an accompanying video clip that featured what appeared to be loud blasts and flying debris. ""As protesters began to disperse, the invaders arrived in police vehicles, and began to force local residents into them,"" the post read. ""A few minutes later, the city was rocked by massive explosions and shelling."" The agency said four people were injured and received medical assistance. Energoatom also claimed that Russian forces jammed phone and internet communications throughout Enerhodar, although the agency’s claims could not be immediately verified. At least three Russian ballistic missiles were fired late Friday at the Odesa region – though the Ukrainian military said the Iskander missiles did not hit the critical infrastructure they targeted. Zelenskyy said he expected towns to receive airstrikes and shelling from afar and for eastern fighting to be intense. In Mariupol, a southern port city located in the mostly Russian-speaking Donbas region, the International Committee of the Red Cross planned Saturday to get emergency supplies into the besieged city and evacuate residents. City authorities said Russians blocked access to the city on Friday and the Red Cross said it was unable to carry out the operation then because it did not receive assurances the route was safe. About 100,000 people are believed to remain in the city and officials said around 2,000 made it out by themselves on Friday. While several agreements have been made to allow residents to evacuate – with one reportedly set for ""coming days"" – they have previously been breached. Residents there are in dire need of water, food, fuel and medicine. ""Europe doesn’t have the right to be silent about what is happening in our Mariupol,"" Zelenskyy said.

The visible shift did not mean the country faced a reprieve from more than five weeks of war or that the more than 4 million refugees who have fled Ukraine will return soon. Zelenskyy said he expects departed towns to endure missile strikes and rocket strikes from afar and for the battle in the east to be intense.

Keith Kellogg on the Russia-Ukraine war. Fox News contributor Gen. Keith Kellogg said on Thursday it's not surprising that Russia is not successful in their war on Ukraine because Vladimir Putin does not have good input from his top advisers. ""When you look at Putin’s primary staff, they’re not well versed in combat. His secretary of defense [Sergei Shoigu] is really a politician. [Valery Gerasimov], the equivalent of our [Mark Milley], their chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, he wrote the doctrine they’re fighting under. It’s a defensive, not offensive doctrine,"" Kellogg told ""America’s Newsroom."" Gutted cars following a night air raid in the village of Bushiv, 40 kilometers west of Kyiv, Ukraine, Friday, March 4, 2022. The former national security adviser to Mike Pence said Russia did not concentrate their efforts on their primary mission to take Kyiv and decapitate and eliminate the Ukrainian government. ""That’s why I said weeks ago, he did not have the troops to task with a plan to even go far to the west past the Dnieper River. They just didn’t do it."" ‘ ’ 'S , , ‘ ,’ It has been over a month since Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Kellogg's comments came after United Kingdom Military Chief Tony Radakin and Defense Secretary Ben Wallace tore into Putin on Thursday, describing him as a self-imploding authoritarian at the helm of an army that has proved itself to be an embarrassment on the world stage. ""In many ways Putin has already lost. Far from being the farsighted manipulator of events that he would have us believe, Putin has damaged himself through a series of catastrophic misjudgments,"" Radakin said. Kellogg explained further that Putin has gotten ""bad advice"" and his staff has been afraid to talk to him. He also added that Russia underestimated Ukraine forces and their opponent Volodymyr Zelenskyy. ""It adds up together. I’m not surprised at all that they have failed and they will continue to fail and they are on the very edge of losing this battle and losing this war."" Joshua Q.

But Kirby also warned that U.S. security officials believe this is a tactic to ""refit"" these troops with new supplies and position them elsewhere in Ukraine. A senior defense official could not confirm what Russia’s plan is for the Donetsk region as speculation has risen that Moscow will focus its forces on eastern Ukraine after failing to make significant advances in other strategic parts of the war-torn nation. Russian ground forces have been stalled around the capital city for weeks following Moscow's invasion five weeks ago, and Ukrainian forces have made advances by pushing Russian troops back from cities in the north and south. Volunteers and soldiers collect bodies of civilians killed by Russian forces at a destroyed bridge in Irpin, near Kyiv, Ukraine, Thursday, March 31, 2022. : But its inability to make ground advances has meant Russia has increasingly relied on missile strikes to hit not only military targets but civilian shelters. More than 1,400 missiles have been launched since the start of the invasion, including more than 300 strikes Wednesday. The U.S. has pledged more than $2.5 billion in security and humanitarian aid, but Washington has faced some criticism for providing military defensive equipment too slowly.

Kyrylo Budanov, the head of Ukrainian military intelligence, accused Russia of seeking to split Ukraine in two, like North and South Korea. ""The occupiers will try to pull the occupied territories into a single quasi-state structure and pit it against independent Ukraine,"" Budanov said in a statement released by the Defense Ministry. He predicted that guerrilla warfare by Ukrainians would derail such plans. A Ukrainian delegate in talks with Russia on ending the war, Davyd Arakhamia, said in a Facebook post the countries would meet in Turkey beginning Monday. However, the Russians then announced the talks would start Tuesday. The sides have met previously with no deal reached. Ukraine says that to defeat Russia, the West must provide fighter jets and not just missiles and other military equipment. A proposal to transfer Polish planes to Ukraine via the United States was scrapped amid concerns about being drawn into direct fighting. In his pointed remarks, Zelenskyy accused Western governments of being ""afraid to prevent this tragedy. Afraid to simply make a decision."" ""So, who is in charge of the Euro-Atlantic community? Is it still Moscow, thanks to its scare tactics?"" he asked. ""Our partners must step up their aid to Ukraine."" His plea was echoed Sunday by a priest in the western city of Lviv, which was struck by rockets a day earlier. The aerial assault illustrated that Moscow, despite assertions that it intends to shift the war eastward, is willing to strike anywhere in Ukraine. Natali Sevriukova reacts next to her house following a rocket attack the city of Kyiv, Ukraine, Friday, Feb. 25, 2022. ""When diplomacy doesn’t work, we need military support,"" said the Rev. Yuri Vaskiv, who reported fewer parishioners in the pews of his Greek Catholic church, likely because of fear. Referring to Putin, he said: ""This evil is from him, and we must stop it."" Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov confirmed Russia used air-launched cruise missiles to hit a fuel depot and a defense plant in Lyiv, about 45 miles from the Polish border. He said another strike with sea-launched missiles destroyed a depot in Plesetske just west of Kyiv, where Ukraine stored air defense missiles. A chemical smell lingered in Lyiv on Sunday as firefighters trained hoses on flames and black smoke poured from oil storage tanks hit in the attack. A security guard, Yaroslav Prokopiv, said he saw three rockets destroy two oil tanks but no one was hurt. Russia’s back-to-back airstrikes shook the city that has become a haven for an estimated 200,000 people who have fled bombarded towns and cities. Lviv, which has largely been spared bombardment, also has been a waystation for most of the 3.8 million refugees who have left Ukraine since Russia invaded on Feb. 24. In a dim, crowded bomb shelter under an apartment block near the first blast site, Olana Ukrainets, a 34-year-old information technology professional, said she couldn’t believe she had to hide again after fleeing from the northeastern city of Kharkiv, one of the most bombarded cities. ""We were on one side of the street and saw it on the other side,"" she said. ""We saw fire. I said to my friend, ‘What’s this?’ Then we heard the sound of an explosion and glass breaking."" In his video address, Zelenskyy angrily warned Moscow that it was sowing a deep hatred for Russia among Ukrainians. ""You are doing everything so that our people themselves leave the Russian language, because the Russian language will now be associated only with you, with your explosions and murders, your crimes,"" Zelenskyy said. Along with the millions of people who have fled Ukraine, the invasion has driven more than 10 million people from their homes, almost one-quarter of Ukraine’s population. Thousands of civilians are believed to have been killed. While Russia’s advance on Kyiv remains stalled, fighting has raged in the suburbs, and blasts from missiles fired into the city have rattled the St. Sophia Cathedral, a 1,000-year-old world heritage site that is the heart of Ukrainian spiritual and national identity. Vadim Kyrylenko, an engineer and conservator who is the most senior manager remaining at the church, said a strike nearby ""would be a point of no return for our landmark because it is very fragile and vulnerable.""

Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., described how America is ""still not doing everything we could do"" to help Ukraine in its war against Russia on Saturday's ""One Nation"" adding the Biden administration is ""finding every reason in the world… to outright deny the delivery of those weapons."" : Unfortunately, it does seem like President Biden has banished the words win and victory from his vocabulary. But that's exactly what President Zelenskyy and the Ukrainian army may be able to pull off in this war if we do provide them those weapons as rapidly as possible, if we get past these legalistic distinctions about offensive or defensive weapons… Russia invaded Ukraine. Ukraine is defending its homeland. Every weapon that Ukraine has is a defensive weapon against its Russian war of aggression. … S-300's are a former Warsaw Pact air defense system that some of our members in Eastern Europe have. They would be happy to provide those systems to Ukraine. They want assurances from our government that we can provide them other air defense systems like Patriot systems. I'm not sure if they're getting those assurances. Another example of the Biden administration dragging its feet are the Switchblade drones, a one-way suicide drone, if you will. These are proven very effective in combat. They were promised to Ukraine almost two weeks ago. The Department of Defense announced just a couple of days ago they still weren't there. They should have been there the day after it was announced. This is just one more example, Brian, of the kind of weapons that Ukraine needs and the administration seems to be finding every reason in the world to drag its feet or even outright deny the delivery of those weapons. … We're still not doing everything we could do. We still could be sending them those S-300 systems to protect their airspace, for instance, or harpoon anti-ship missiles, coastal batteries that could destroy Russian ships just like they did the other day with one ballistic missile. These things should have been happening months ago, but it was really the bravery and the skill of the Ukrainian army and the leadership of President Zelenskyy that forced the hand of Western leaders to include Joe Biden to finally do what we should have done months ago.",49,4.6523390472257935,4.950481334773969,-0.29814228754817584,9

Mikhail Mizintsev has earned the nickname ""Butcher of Mariupol"" for masterminding the harrowing attack on the Ukrainian city that has reduced it to rubble. Ukrainian military officials claim that Mizintsev orchestrated a similar attack in Syria, leaving the city of Aleppo bomb-shattered. The attack in Mariupol included the bombing of a theater that had marked itself as a shelter with children – an attack that killed roughly 300 people seeking refuge at the time. : Mizintsev, 59, serves as the head of the National Centre for Defense Management, which Russia established in 2014 to direct future military operations.

Russian and Syrian warplanes are bombing the streets into rubble and government forces are chipping away at the pocket of opposition control. Here’s what else you need to know about the man who sits in one of the most powerful seats in Russia. Mizintsev was born during the height of the Soviet Union’s power in 1962 in a village some 400 miles outside of Moscow. He swiftly rose through the ranks, studying at the Kiev Higher Combined Arms Command School before becoming the commander of a recon platoon in the Soviet army in East Germany – the same region where agent Vladimir Putin operated. ‘ ’ Following the fall of the Soviet Union, Mizintsev deployed to the Caucasus to command a motorized rifle battalion. His return to Moscow in the late 1990s led to rapid promotion, culminating in a post in 2003 as the head of operations directorate of the chief of staff, a role that tasked him with military planning duties. He then took control of the National Centre for Defense Management, at which point he reportedly coordinated Russia’s involvement in the Syrian civil war between 2015 and 2016. - , ‘ ’ Russia assisted Syrian government forces with a series of air strikes, hitting Aleppo with attacks that killed around 1,700 civilians.

""Ukraine was taken very seriously by Special Forces,"" retired Green Beret Sgt. Maj. Martin Moore told Fox News Digital. After Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014, a move that faced minimal resistance, the Ukrainian military began an effort to modernize its forces to prepare for possible further Russian incursions into the country. The U.S. military also quickly stepped in to help, with the Army's Green Berets taking on a critical role in training Ukrainian forces. Ukrainian soldiers take positions outside a military facility , 96, : ""They immediately set upon a great effort to protect to Ukraine, to provide training,"" Moore said. ""There's nobody better at training than Green Berets. These are people that can teach."" While elite military units such as the Navy teams garner widespread attention, the Army's Green Berets are fanned out across the world helping armies prepare for wars similar to the one now being fought in Ukraine. This work is typically done quietly, something Moore said Green Berets prefer. ""They do something different,"" Moore said. ""They go where nobody else is and find out what is possible."" Moore said Green Berets are a ""force multiplier,"" improving the combat capability of the international forces they work with. He stressed that they are not about ""raids and ambushes,"" but about having an ""unparalleled understanding of the place"" where they are operating. A Green Berets U.S. Army Special Forces Group soldier in action - Green Berets are required to learn a foreign language as part of their training and are constantly trained in the political, economic and cultural complexities of the regions in which they are assigned to operate. This unique skill set allows them to partner with foreign forces for training and at times to fight alongside them. Those skills have been put to use in Ukraine since 2014, with Green Berets and members of the Army's National Guard advising and training Ukrainian forces at Yavoriv Combat Training Center in western Ukraine. It's the same facility Russia attacked with rockets on March 13, killing 35. The Americans had already left, vacating the facility and moving troops deployed there to Germany in February. Part of the job Green Berets did at Yavoriv was to train their Ukrainian counterparts to set up militia units that could wage guerrilla warfare against an invading force. The Ukrainian military can now put those lessons to use, with the government actively encouraging its citizens to join the fight against Russian forces. Civilians practice moving in groups at a military training exercise. But the work Green Berets are doing in Europe hasn't stopped, with forces still stationed in Europe helping prepare partner countries for the possibility of a Russian invasion farther into Europe. Such a move would be a mistake for Russia, Moore told Fox News Digital, arguing that the invasion of Ukraine has already gone poorly in part because of U.S. assistance, and a further move into territory would go even worse.

John Katko, R-N.Y., leaves the Capitol after the House vote on an impeachment inquiry resolution on Thursday, October 31, 2019. ) The Biden administration has worked to strengthen cyber defenses after a string of ransomware attacks last summer, with foreign malign actors targeting pieces of U.S. critical infrastructure. In June 2021, a ransomware assault shut down the U.S.-based meat plants of the world’s largest meatpacker, Brazil-based . The White House said the hack was likely carried out by a criminal group based in Russia. The attack on came just weeks after the largest U.S. fuel pipeline, the East Coast's Colonial Pipeline, was targeted by a criminal group originating in Russia. Biden, during his summit in Geneva with Russian President Vladimir Putin in June 2021, raised the issue of ransomware. Biden, at the time, said he told Putin that ""certain critical infrastructure should be off limits to attack."" Biden said he gave a list of ""16 specific entities defined as critical infrastructure,"" saying it ranged from energy to water systems. Putin, though, during his press conference after the meeting, denied that Russia was responsible for cyberattacks and instead claimed that most cyberattacks in the world were carried out from the U.S. But Katko slammed Biden for his strategy. ""I wanted to scream,"" Katko told Fox News. ""Everything is off limits—they shouldn’t be doing it at all, and if they are doing it, we should be fighting back hard."" ""The problem is this administration has not gone back against Russia, has not gone back against China, has not gone back against Iran,"" Katko continued. ""We’re not doing anything about it and the bad guys are getting emboldened."" Katko told Fox News that the ""biggest thing"" Congress can do is ensure that the Cybersecurity Infrastructure Security Agency is given ""the tools it needs."" ' ' ""It needs more funding and support, but they’re doing a great job already,"" Katko said. ""They do not need to be a regulatory agency, they need to be a partner with the private sector to keep the system secure, and if they continue to do that, that would be great."" Katko added that ""the more resources"" Congress can give , ""the better our country is going to be from a cyber standpoint."" On whether Russia will carry out a cyberattack against the United States, Katko replied: ""I’d be very surprised if they don’t."" Pointing to the attacks last year on the Colonial Pipeline and , Katko said Russia was looking to ""disrupt our fuel supply."" ""You know, if Russia hit critical infrastructure, energy, power grids, banking institutions, hospitals, wherever, whatever they do, that can have a profound effect on all Americans,"" Katko warned. ""We need to be ready for it and we need to have our guard up and we need to make sure our systems are as secure as they can be."" Biden, this week, said this is ""a critical moment to accelerate our work to improve domestic cybersecurity and bolster our national resilience."" The Biden administration has been warning about the potential for ""malicious cyber activity"" against the United States by the Russian government—which Biden said could be a response to the ""unprecedented economic costs we’ve imposed on Russia alongside our allies and partners. It’s part of Russia's playbook."" President Biden hasn't done enough to deter a Russian cyberattack, according to a top House Republican. ""Today, my Administration is reiterating those warnings based on evolving intelligence that the Russian Government is exploring options for potential cyberattacks,"" Biden said Monday. The Biden administration has been working to ""strengthen"" national cyber defenses, and has mandated ""extensive cybersecurity measures for the Federal Government and those critical infrastructure sectors where we have authority to do so."" The president on Monday also stressed that the administration has created ""public-private partnerships and initiatives to enhance cybersecurity across all our critical infrastructure."" ""Congress has partnered with us on these efforts — we appreciate that Members of Congress worked across the aisle to require companies to report cyber incidents to the United States Government,"" Biden said. ""My Administration will continue to use every tool to deter, disrupt, and if necessary, respond to cyberattacks against critical infrastructure,"" the president said Monday, but said the ""Federal Government can’t defend against this threat alone."" : ""Most of America’s critical infrastructure is owned and operated by the private sector and critical infrastructure owners and operators must accelerate efforts to lock their digital doors,"" Biden said. "" The Department of Homeland Security’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency has been actively working with organizations across critical infrastructure to rapidly share information and mitigation guidance to help protect their systems and networks."" The president urged private sector partners to ""harden your cyber defenses immediately by implementing the best practices we have developed together over the last year."" ""You have the power, the capacity, and the responsibility to strengthen the cybersecurity and resilience of the critical services and technologies on which Americans rely,"" Biden said. ""We need everyone to do their part to meet one of the defining threats of our time — your vigilance and urgency today can prevent or mitigate attacks tomorrow."" Biden in July signed a national security memorandum directing his administration to develop cybersecurity performance goals for critical infrastructure in the U.S. – entities like electricity utility companies, chemical plants and nuclear reactors. The memo also formally established Biden's Cyber Security Initiative, a voluntary collaborative effort between the federal government and critical infrastructure entities to facilitate the deployment of technology and systems that provide threat visibility indicators and detections.",20,7.3880654388797256,5.778502363155623,1.6095630757241022,24

2022-03-24,Fox,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/next-phase-russia-ukraine-war-4-things-chuck-devore,Russia-Ukraine war's next phase – 4 things to watch,"John Herbst expresses offense at American reluctance to provide MiGs to Ukraine on 'Your World.' Russia’s first military campaign against Ukraine has culminated without reaching its objectives: the overthrow of the government of Volodymyr Zelenskyy and the installation of a pro-Moscow puppet regime. Incapable of defeating the Ukrainian military, Russia now seeks to destroy Ukrainian cities, killing as many civilians as possible to force a surrender. It won’t happen, as each barrage steels Ukrainian resolve to resist. A member of Ukraine's Territorial Defense Forces during training. As Russia’s war on Ukraine enters a new phase, here are four things to watch. 'S - Ukraine’s army Ukraine has 7 million people fit for military service and is seeking to mobilize them for the defense of the nation. Ukraine can draft more military personnel than can Russia, as Ukraine is in an existential fight and has virtually unlimited financial backing from the and America. By mid-April, hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians will have received enough training to competently serve as infantry, allowing Ukraine to replace losses and increase the size of many units. This will give Ukraine the option to increase counterattacks – if it has tolerance for the higher losses that might entail. Russia’s options Until the fields dry out in late May or early June, allowing for rapid cross-country mobility, Russia will only have one viable option: to pound Ukrainian cities with artillery. To do so, Russia needs to secure supply lines to within 10 to 20 miles from city centers – the range of its rocket launchers and artillery. And it needs to protect them from increasingly effective Ukrainian drones. Russia has a bigger challenge with mounting something more than harassing bombardment against Ukraine. The abysmal state of their maintenance practices has stripped them of the trucks needed to ship the thousands of tons of artillery ammunition to the front. Belarus Belarus recalled its ambassador from Ukraine a few days ago and is making noises that it might send troops to help Russia. There are three problems with that. First, the Belarussian army isn’t very good—its main job is to cow its own citizens into not overthrowing Belarussian strongman president Alexander Lukashenko. Second, the border between Belarus and Ukraine is defined by the extensive Pripyat Marsh, one of the world's largest, making military movement south difficult. Third, if Lukashenko does commit a significant portion of his army against Ukraine, he risks domestic unrest that threatens his own regime – and by extension, Russian President Vladimir Putin. That risk outweighs any gains that would be expected on the battlefield. China Putin has asked China for help. The areas in which Russia has the greatest need are precision-guided munition resupply and new trucks. America and its allies need to make it very clear to China that seeing equipment of Chinese manufacture in Ukraine will trigger significant sanctions on the Chinese economy. The West cannot afford to allow Beijing to bail Moscow out of its Kyiv quagmire. The last thing the free world needs is an ascendant alliance of dictatorial states.",49,4.104057917335022,4.552322812029976,-0.4482648946949537,28

The U.N. agency said information has been delayed and many reports are pending corroboration from areas where intense hostilities have been going on such as in the southern port city of Mariupol and Volnovakha in the Donetsk region, Izium in the Kharkiv region, Sievierodonetsk and Rubizhne in the Luhansk region, and Trostianets in Sumy region, amid claims of numerous civilian casualties there. In areas like Sumy, there are about 800,000 people ""nearly entirely reliant"" on aid shipped in on a day-to-day basis, Gordon said. In Mariupol, with communications crippled, movement restricted and many residents in hiding, the fate of those inside an art school flattened on Sunday and a theater that was blown apart four days earlier was unclear. More than 1,300 people were believed to be sheltering in the theater, and 400 were estimated to have been in the art school.

As Russia intensified its effort to pound Mariupol into submission, its ground offensive in other parts of Ukraine has become bogged down. Western officials and analysts say the conflict is turning into a grinding war of attrition, with Russia bombarding cities. ) It is not clear how close Mariupol's capture might be. Ukraine’s Defense Ministry said Tuesday that their forces were still defending the city and had destroyed a Russian patrol boat and electronic warfare complex. Over the weekend, Moscow had offered safe passage out of Mariupol — one corridor leading east to Russia, another going west to other parts of Ukraine — in return for the city’s surrender before daybreak Monday. Ukraine flatly rejected the offer well before the deadline. Mariupol had a prewar population of about 430,000. Around a quarter were believed to have left in the opening days of the war, and tens of thousands escaped over the past week by way of the humanitarian corridors. Other attempts have been thwarted by the fighting. Mariupol's officials said on March 15 that at least 2,300 people had died in the siege, with some buried in mass graves. There has been no official estimate since then, but the number is feared to be far higher after six more days of bombardment. Zelenskyy’s count of dead children was two more than the 115 total recorded by the Prosecutor General’s Office of Ukraine as of 8 a.m. local time Monday. At least 148 more children had been injured by then, according to the prosecutor’s office. The U.N. said it was still working to corroborate a report from the Head of the Investigative Department of the National Police of Kharkiv Region saying 276 civilians, including 15 children, had been killed in the region as of Monday at 6 p.m. local time. The has been documenting civilian casualties in Ukraine since 2014, the same year Russia annexed Crimea, but since the Russian military invaded on Feb. 24, the Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine has been unable to visit places of incidents and interview witnesses and victims. As a result, the U.N. explained that the usual method of corroboration and crosschecking information was disrupted in Ukraine, so the current figures are based on individual civilian casualty records where the ""reasonable grounds to believe"" standard of proof was met.

2022-03-22,Fox,https://www.foxnews.com/world/ukraine-retakes-kyiv-suburb-battle-mariupol,Ukraine says its retaken key Kyiv suburb; battle for Mariupol rages,"Serhiy Prytula, who is running a supplies center in Ukraine, joined 'America's Newsroom' to discuss what the resistance needs as the war rages on. Ukraine said it retook a strategically important suburb of Kyiv on Tuesday, as Russian forces squeezed other areas near the capital and pressed their attack on the embattled southern port of Mariupol. Explosions and bursts of gunfire shook Kyiv, and black smoke rose from a spot in the north. Intensified artillery fire could be heard from the northwest, where Russia has sought to encircle and capture several suburban areas of the capital, a crucial target. Residents sheltered at home or underground under a 35-hour curfew imposed by city authorities that runs to Wednesday morning. Russian forces also continued their siege of Mariupol after the southern port city’s defenders refused demands to surrender, with fleeing civilians describing relentless bombardments and corpses lying in the streets. But the Kremlin’s ground offensive in other parts of the country advanced slowly or not at all, knocked back by lethal hit-and-run attacks by the Ukrainians. , 3 4 Early Tuesday, Ukrainian troops drove Russian forces out of the Kyiv suburb of Makariv after a fierce battle, Ukraine’s Defense Ministry said. The regained territory allowed Ukrainian forces to retake control of a key highway and block Russian troops from surrounding Kyiv from the northwest. Still, the Defense Ministry said Russian forces were able to partially take other northwest suburbs, Bucha, Hostomel and Irpin, some of which had been under attack almost since Russia’s military invaded almost a month ago. Russia’s invasion has driven more than 10 million people from their homes, almost a quarter of Ukraine’s pre-war population, according to the United Nations. The U.N. has confirmed 953 civilian deaths while saying the real toll is probably much higher. People carry wooden boards to cover the windows of a building damaged by a bombing the previous day in Kyiv, Ukraine, Monday, March 21, 2022. As Russia intensified its effort to pound Mariupol into submission, its ground offensive in other parts of Ukraine has become bogged down. Western officials and analysts say the conflict is turning into a grinding war of attrition, with Russia bombarding cities. ) Estimates of Russian military casualties in the grinding war have been hard to come by and vary, but even conservative figures by Western officials are in the low thousands. Russia has not given an update since it said March 2 that 498 soldiers had been killed in action in Ukraine. Russia’s pro-Kremlin Komsomolskaya Pravda newspaper, citing the Defense Ministry, briefly reported Monday that almost 10,000 Russian soldiers had been killed. The report was quickly removed, and newspaper blamed hackers. The Kremlin refused to comment on Tuesday. Beyond the terrible human toll, the war has shaken the post-Cold War global security consensus, imperiled the global supply of key crops including wheat, and repeatedly raised worries it could set off a nuclear accident. Ukraine’s natural resources minister said wildfires near the Chernobyl nuclear power plant have been extinguished and radiation levels in the area are within norms. Fires are not uncommon in the area, but raise concern about the potential release of radiation from fallout from the 1986 explosion and fire at the plant. Concerns have been expressed for safety at the decommissioned plant since it was seized by Russian forces last month. The power supply was temporarily cut amid fighting earlier this month, and Ukraine’s nuclear regulatory agency said Monday that radiation monitors around the plant had stopped working. Facing unexpectedly stiff resistance, Russian President Vladimir Putin’s forces are increasingly concentrating their air power and artillery on Ukraine’s cities and the civilians living there. A senior U.S. defense official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the military’s assessment, said Russia had increased its air sorties, carrying out as many as 300 over a 24-hour period. U.S. and British officials say Kyiv remains Russia’s primary objective. The bulk of Moscow’s forces remain miles from the center, but missiles and artillery have destroyed apartment buildings and a large shopping mall, which was left a smoking ruin after being hit late Sunday by strikes that killed eight people, according to emergency officials. ‘,’ 'S ‘ ’ U.S. President Joe Biden, who is heading to Europe later in the week to meet with allies, suggested Monday evening that worse may be still to come. ""Putin’s back is against the wall,"" Biden said. ""He wasn’t anticipating the extent or the strength of our unity. And the more his back is against the wall, the greater the severity of the tactics he may employ."" Biden reiterated accusations that Putin is considering resorting to using chemical or biological weapons, though Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said Tuesday that the United States has seen no evidence to suggest that use of such weapons was ""imminent.""

It is reported that, 8 people were killed in the Russian attack on shopping mall. Talks to end the fighting have continued by video but failed to bridge the chasm between the two sides. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy told Ukrainian television late Monday that he would be prepared to consider waiving any bid by Ukraine to join — a key Russian demand — in exchange for a cease-fire, the withdrawal of Russian troops and a guarantee of Ukraine’s security. Zelenskyy also suggested Kyiv would be open to future discussions on the status of Crimea, which Russia seized in 2014, and areas of the eastern Donbas region held by Russian-backed separatists. But he said that was a topic for another time. As part of a series of addresses to foreign legislatures to drum up support for Ukraine, Zelenskyy spoke to Italian lawmakers on Tuesday, telling them that the besieged port of Mariupol had been utterly destroyed in the Russian onslaught. He also spoke to Pope Francis. ""Imagine a Genoa completely burned down,"" he said to rapt lawmakers, citing an Italian port city of a similar size. Mariupol officials said on March 15 that at least 2,300 people had died in the siege, and they have not given an update since. Zelenskyy said 117 children had been killed in the war so far. 'S Some people managed to flee Mariupol, where weeks of Russian bombardment has cut off electricity, water and food supplies and severed communication with the outside world. The city council said Tuesday that more than 1,100 people who had escaped the besieged city were on their way in a convoy of buses to another city to Mariupol’s northwest. But the Red Cross said a humanitarian aid convoy trying to reach the embattled city with desperately needed supplies still had not been able to enter.

A Russian airstrike devastated a maternity hospital Wednesday in the besieged port city of Mariupol amid growing warnings from the West that Moscow's invasion is about to take a more brutal and indiscriminate turn. ) Perched on the Sea of Azov, Mariupol is a crucial port for Ukraine and lies along a stretch of territory between Russia and Crimea. The siege of Mariupol has cut the city off from the sea and allowed Russia to establish a land corridor to Crimea. But it’s not clear how much of the city it holds, with fleeing residents saying fighting continues street by street. Ukraine’s Defense Ministry said Tuesday that their forces were still defending the city and had destroyed a Russian patrol boat and electronic warfare complex. Britain’s Defense Ministry said its intelligence showed that ""Ukrainian forces continue to repulse Russian attempts to occupy"" the city. Those who have made it out of Mariupol told of a devastated city. ""Mariupol is almost 99% destroyed,"" said 39-year-old Viktoria Totsen, who managed to escape the city and cross into Poland. ""They bombed us for the past 20 days. During the last five days the planes were flying over us every five seconds and dropped bombs everywhere — on residential buildings, kindergartens, art schools, everywhere."" In all, more than 8,000 people escaped to safer areas Monday through humanitarian corridors, including about 3,000 from Mariupol, Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said. Overall, more than 3.5 million people have fled Ukraine, while another 6.5 million have been displaced inside the country.",47,3.0578174513396372,4.457882104553117,-1.4000646532134797,19

""We've assessed, for the first time, that the Russians may be slightly below a 90% level of assessed available combat power,"" a senior defense official told reporters. Ukrainian soldiers are seen near a collapsed bridge that was the target of a Russian missile, near the town of Irpin, Ukraine, on March 3, 2022. ; The drop in power is reflective of the 150,000 soldiers he amassed on Ukraine’s border in the lead-up to the invasion last month. ""It is not an assessment of all Russian military power,"" the senior defense official added. Security officials continue to warn that Putin may be looking to bring supplemental forces into Ukraine to aid his war as Russian ground forces remain stalled across the country. But there is scant evidence that any foreign fighters have headed to Ukraine despite reports that Putin has offered incentives to fighters from nations like Syria. The senior defense official said there are indications of continued ""discussions"" by Moscow to aid its war ""both in terms of resupply and also reinforcement,"" but there is no indication any such plan has been enacted. Experts anticipate that if the Kremlin does move to send in reinforcements, it would pull support from troops stationed outside of Russia before pulling additional troops from inside its own borders. ""Of the battalion tactical groups that Mr. Putin has available to him across Russia, he's used about 75% in this particular operation,"" the senior defense official explained. ""So I think our assumption would be he'd pull from outside the country first.""

""We're definitely seeing anecdotal evidence that the Ukrainians are not only defending well, where they choose to defend, but they are making efforts to take back territory,"" the senior defense official added. Reports surfaced Tuesday showing that Ukrainian forces were able to retake a suburb outside of Kyiv, but the senior defense official said they were unable to verify the reporting. Citing the Russian Ministry of Defense, a Russian tabloid claimed this week that 9,861 Russian troops had been killed in the fighting with another 16,000 injured – a stark difference from the 498 troops killed and 1,597 reported as injured by the ministry on March 2. The report has since been taken down and the Pentagon has been unable to verify any causality estimates during the 27-day war.

Russia's invasion of Mariupol and other key Ukrainian cities like Kyiv have forced people underground and destroyed signs of civilization, leaving people without food, water, electricity and ways to communicate with their families. Maria Smarovailo, a Mariupol native who has since left the city, told Fox News Digital that there has been ""no food for more than three weeks."" Local residents stay at a bomb shelter during Ukraine-Russia conflict in the besieged southern port city of Mariupol, Ukraine March 20, 2022. ""In the first week of hostiles in the city, residents bought food in stores en masse,"" she said, according to a translation. When electricity, water and cellphone signals were cut, people began collecting snow and rainwater and looting stores that were still standing ""to get at least some food and water for children."" : She added later that Russians are not allowing humanitarian aid into the city, and ""many people do not know that volunteers are working to evacuate people"" because there is no internet or cellphone signal for residents to communicate with one another. Only those with cars are successful in helping people escape because Russian forces are not allowing buses into Mariupol's city limits, she said.

John Cornyn, R-Texas, discussed with ‘America's Newsroom’ his time in Germany and Poland meeting Ukrainian refugees. Few anticipated the Ukraine war would last this long much less that Kyiv would push the massive Russian army back on its heels. However, that’s exactly what has happened, a modern example of the biblical story of the young David with a sling shot and a stone standing up against the armor-clad Philistine giant Goliath egging for a take-all fight. Could David defeat Goliath? Yes, it’s possible because Goliath was much too cocky and he underestimated the shepherd boy. Russia’s Vladimir Putin massed nearly 200,000 troops on Ukraine’s border calling for that nation’s capitulation, a winner takes all outcome. Ukraine ignored the giant’s arrogant challenges, stepped forward and proved itself far more capable than the Russians ever anticipated. : Even Putin’s top Chechen ally, Ramzan Kadyrov, has criticized the Russian effort, shouting the assault was ""too slow"" and was ""fiddling"" with Ukraine. Russian soldiers, said the brutal Chechen, ""… are not effective,"" and then he called on Putin to give ""harsher orders."" Firefighters douse the fire in the Retroville shopping mall after a Russian attack on the northwest of the capital Kyiv on March 21, 2022. - At least six people were killed in the overnight bombing of a shopping centre in the Ukrainian capital Kyiv, an journalist said, with rescuers combing the wreckage for other victims.

Destroyed shopping center after it was hit in a military strike in the Podilskyi residential district of Kyiv, as Russia's invasion of Ukraine continues, in Kyiv, Ukraine March 21, 2022 It is true that Putin’s war machine is unimpressive, starting with his flawed Ukraine campaign plan. His intelligence assumptions totally underestimated the Ukrainians, and his army wasn’t prepared. He fielded a force of poorly trained soldiers, virtually no air-to-ground capability, inadequate logistics and his equipment was not up to a fight with a determined, capable enemy. Those flaws virtually guaranteed a long, bloody quagmire. In this image from video provided by the Ukrainian Presidential Press Office and posted on Facebook, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy speaks in Kyiv, Ukraine, on Friday, March 11, 2022. These failures, on top of significant human and equipment losses, have forced Putin into reverting to what he did in Chechnya and Syria: a total destruction strategy. After all, taking Ukrainian cities like Kyiv, which he now surrounds, would require far more Russian soldiers because in city fighting, the defender has at least a five-fold advantage. ‘’ 400 Thus, the tyrant is turning to his vast arsenal of long-range weapons to depopulate Ukrainian cities. That war of attrition ends only when either Putin no longer has the means or will to fight, or the Ukrainians can’t survive more destruction and killing. The David-like Ukraine brought to this fight more than bravery and a sling shot. Ukrainians are determined and quite capable – fighting for their survival with a home-field advantage. They caught Putin’s army off-guard, and now they are extracting a heavy price on Moscow.

""We go out to hunt and destroy"" Russians, said a Ukrainian special forces leader. The Russians ""… certainly didn’t come here expecting that, expecting that we know how to fight."" Taking the fight to the Russians is effective, such as destroying Russian armor, a reported 93% kill rate. ' ' , At every corner Ukrainians meet Russians and refuse to give ground. ""We’re in shock at how dumb their behavior is,"" a Ukrainian soldier said of his enemy. ""Now, we mostly focus on hitting their rear, their supply convoys, because if they don’t get fuel, they can’t do anything."" These attacks are Putin’s Achilles heel because at some point his army’s morale will vaporize and desertions will skyrocket. It is possible the Ukraine war could last years like the Soviet campaign in Afghanistan, a long costly affair that bleeds Moscow dry or Putin might recklessly expand the war to the rest of Europe. However, it’s more likely that a variety of factors will weigh on Putin’s decision to sue for a face-saving outcome. . ''S ': 'S A '' Those indicators include: unsustainable battlefield losses, home front protests, economic collapse, the departure of western businesses and lack of expected Chinese support. Hopefully, Putin seeks peace before he reverts to the total destruction of all Ukrainian cities or dares expand the war to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, both unlikely and unsustainable alternatives. There are at least four possible scenarios that bring an end to the fighting in Ukraine. First, Ukraine fights Russia to a draw and negotiates the withdrawal of Russian forces, possibly giving up much of eastern Ukraine and all claims to Crimea. Ukraine is forced to renounce ever joining and the European Union. Also, Moscow will almost certainly require a new election and constitution that mandates Ukraine embrace a permanent neutral status. Second, Russia wins and dismembers Ukraine and installs a puppet government. However, Moscow would likely face years of insurgency and be considered a global pariah, weighed down by crippling sanctions, sputtering forward thanks only to China’s economic support. Meanwhile, the annihilation of Ukraine sparks a new cold war with that finds barriers separating the new east from west and forward deployed combat forces face off on both sides of a new ""Iron Curtain."" Third, there is the real possibility that the West intervenes in the fight and convinces Moscow to withdraw to avoid escalation to nuclear war while the West removes all sanctions and provides guarantees that Ukraine will never become a member of or the . At that point the West launches a Marshall Plan-like program to help rebuild Ukraine and returns to the status quo Antebellum. Fourth, a real ""David""-like best outcome for the West and Ukraine is the withdrawal of Russian forces and the restoration of the state. The Scowcroft Center says this is the ""rosiest"" possible scenario which allows that Ukraine’s resistance overcomes ""the odds and grind Moscow’s advance to a halt."" Then the wounded Putin seeks an escape as his country turns on him. Each of these scenarios bring an end to hostilities but leaves open the possibility of a future east, west war. Yes, underdog ""David"" can ""win"" Putin’s war albeit at the cost of thousands of lives, much of Ukraine’s infrastructure, and the advent of European tensions not seen since the end of the old Cold War. Sadly, the price of this conflict even with the ""rosiest"" scenario leads to a heavy peace in which Ukraine unlikely ever again really enjoys the freedom and prosperity it experienced since the demise of the former Soviet Union.",7,3.7604509105560275,4.526289058076201,-0.7658381475201734,29

I’ve frequently been there when conflicts peaked and I’ve unfortunately witnessed the very worst of humanity. But while war zones are inherently cruel, few are designed like Mariupol — aimed to inflict maximum human suffering, to be Putin's funhouse of terror. Putin's use of sweeping terror tactics is no accident. The targeting of civilians in mass bombing campaigns is designed to force Ukraine's population into submission, to convince residents in larger cities like Kyiv that resistance is futile and will only lead to total devastation and huge death tolls. This is a playbook the Russian dictator honed in Aleppo, the Syrian city Russian forces levelled in 2016 in their brutal intervention to prop up the regime of Bashar Al-Assad. I saw this at first hand - the bunker buster bombs dropped on buildings specifically to exterminate whole families, the kids picked off by snipers on their way to school, the way that hospitals were the key targets of Russian attacks. These are all war crimes of course, but Putin got away with it in Syria. Europeans kept buying oil and gas from the Kremlin. Obama promised to intervene and then when the 'red line' of chemical weapons use was crossed, he bottled it. Putin drew the obvious conclusion that America was too weak and divided to confront him - and the stage was set for Ukraine.

2022-03-20,Fox,https://www.foxnews.com/world/ukraine-war-is-backdrop-in-us-push-for-hypersonic-weapons,Ukraine war is backdrop in US push for hypersonic weapons,"Lagging behind Russia in developing hypersonic weapons, the U.S. Navy is rushing to field its first, with installation on a warship starting as soon as late next year. The United States is in a race with Russia and China to develop these weapons, which travel at speeds akin to ballistic missiles but are difficult to shoot down because of their maneuverability. The Russian military says it already deployed hypersonic missiles, claiming on both Saturday and Sunday to have fired them on targets in Ukraine, marking the weapon’s first use in combat. The Pentagon couldn’t confirm a hypersonic weapon was used in the attacks. 'T ' ' : The American military is accelerating development to catch up. The U.S. weapon would launch like a ballistic missile and would release a hypersonic glide vehicle that would reach speeds seven to eight times faster than the speed of sound before hitting the target. In Maine, General Dynamics subsidiary Bath Iron Works has begun engineering and design work on changes necessary to install the weapon system on three Zumwalt-class destroyers. The work would begin at a yet-to-be-named shipyard sometime in fiscal year that begins in October 2023, the Navy said. A common hypersonic glide body launching from the Pacific Missile Range Facility, in Kauai, Hawaii, March 19, 2020, during a Department of Defense flight experiment. Hypersonic weapons are defined as anything traveling beyond Mach 5, or five times faster than the speed of sound. That’s about 3,800 mph . Intercontinental ballistic missiles far exceed that threshold but travel in a predictable path, making it possible to intercept them. The new weapons are maneuverable. Existing missile defense systems, including the Navy’s Aegis system, would have trouble intercepting such objects because maneuverability makes their movement unpredictable and speed leaves little time to react. Russia says it has ballistic missiles that can deploy hypersonic glide vehicles as well as a hypersonic cruise missile. , , ' ' The U.S. is ""straining just to catch up"" because it failed to invest in the new technology, with only a fraction of the 10,000 people who were working on the program in the 1980s, said U.S. Rep. Jim Cooper, D-Tenn., who is chair of a subcommittee that monitors the program. ""If we want to pursue parity, we will need to back this effort with more money, time and talent than we are now,"" he said. The Russian invasion of Ukraine serves as a backdrop as the Pentagon releases its budget proposal that lays out its goals for hypersonics and other weapon systems later this month. The three stealthy Zumwalt-class destroyers to be equipped with the new weapons have plenty of space to accommodate them – thanks to a design failure that works to the Navy’s advantage in this instance. The ships were built around a gun system that was supposed to use -guided, rocket-boosted projectiles to pound targets 90 miles away. But those projectiles proved to be too expensive, and the Navy canceled the system, leaving each of the ships with a useless loading system and a pair of 155-mm guns hidden in angular turrets. , ’S ‘ ’ The retrofit of all three ships will likely cost more than $1 billion but will give a new capability to the tech-laden, electric-drive ships that already cost the Navy $23.5 billion to design and build, said Bryan Clark, a defense analyst at the Hudson Institute. ""The engineering is not that hard. It’ll just take time and money to make it happen,"" Clark said. The Navy intends to field the weapons on the destroyers in the 2025 fiscal year and on Virginia-class nuclear-powered attack submarines in the 2028 fiscal year, the Navy said. The Lyndon B. Johnson travels down the Kennebec River on its way to sea on Jan. 12, 2022, in Phippsburg, Maine. The destroyers would be based in the Pacific Ocean, where they would be a deterrent to China, should it become emboldened by Russia’s attack on Ukraine and consider attacking Taiwan, Clark said. The U.S. focus on hypersonic weapons represents a pivot after hesitating in the past because of technological hurdles. Adversaries, meanwhile, continued research and development. Russia fired off a salvo of Zircon hypersonic cruise missiles in late December, heralding the completion of weapon testing. ' ' : But Russia may be exaggerating the capability of such super weapons to compensate for weakness in other areas, said Loren Thompson, a defense analyst at the Lexington Institute.",49,5.373203159365787,4.140345836224767,1.2328573231410207,22

The fall of Mariupol would allow Russian forces across southern and eastern Ukraine to link up. But Western military analysts say that even if the surrounded city is taken, the troops battling for control there a block at a time may be too depleted to help secure Russian breakthroughs on other fronts. Three weeks into the invasion, Western governments and analysts see the conflict shifting to a war of attrition, with bogged down Russian forces launching long-range missiles at cities and military bases as Ukrainian forces carry out hit-and-run attacks and seek to sever their supply lines. The strike on the art school was the second time in less than a week that local officials reported an attack on a public building where Mariupol residents had taken shelter. A bomb hit a theater where more than 1,000 people were believed to be sheltering on Wednesday. There was no immediate word on casualties from the reported strike on the school, which The Associated Press could not independently verify. Ukrainian officials have not given an update on the search of the theater since Friday, when they said at least 130 people had been rescued and another 1,300 were trapped by rubble. City officials and aid groups have described dire conditions in Mariupol, where food, water and electricity have run low and the fighting has prevented humanitarian convoys from reaching the city. The Russian siege also severed communication lines in Mariupol, making it difficult to verify reports from the city.

Unexpectedly strong Ukrainian resistance has dashed Russian President Vladimir Putin’s hopes for a fast victory after he ordered his troops to invade Ukraine on Feb. 24. In recent days, Russian forces have battled their way into Mariupol, cutting it off from the Azov Sea and devastating a massive steel plant. But the city’s fall could prove a costly victory. , , ' ' ""The block-by-block fighting in Mariupol itself is costing the Russian military time, initiative and combat power,"" the Washington-based Institute for the Study of War said in a briefing. In a blunt assessment of the war in Ukraine, the think tank concluded that Russia failed in its initial campaign to take the capital, Kyiv, and other major cities quickly and its stalled invasion is creating the conditions for a ""very violent and bloody"" stalemate. In major cities across Ukraine, hundreds of men, women and children have already been killed in Russian bombardments, while millions have raced to underground shelters or fled the country.

A rocket attack on the Black Sea port city of Mykolaiv early Friday killed as many as 40 marines, a Ukrainian military official told The New York Times, making it one of the deadliest single attacks on Ukrainian forces. In a separate strike, the Russian Defense Ministry said a Kinzhal hypersonic missile hit a Ukrainian fuel depot in Kostiantynivka, a city near Mykolaiv. The Russian military said Saturday that it used a Kinzhal for the first time in combat to destroy an ammunition depot in the Carpathian Mountains in western Ukraine. Ukrainian civilians receive weapons training in Lviv, Western Ukraine, Saturday, March 19, 2022. Russia has said the Kinzhal, carried by MiG-31 fighter jets, has a range of up to 2,000 kilometers and flies at 10 times the speed of sound.

Russian Defense Ministry spokesperson Igor Konashenkov said Kalibr cruise missiles launched by Russian warships from the Caspian Sea were also involved in the strike on the fuel depot in Kostiantynivka and were used to destroy an armor repair plant in northern Ukraine. Western analysts have downplayed the significance of Russia’s use of the hypersonic weapon, saying the missiles did not give Moscow an extra advantage but were a tool the Kremlin could use to advertise its military might and warn other countries against intervening. - ""It’s not a game-changer,"" but rather a ""message of intimidation and deterrence toward Ukraine and toward the West,"" said Valeriy Akimenko, senior research associate at the Conflict Studies Research Centre in England.

The Russian military hasn’t confirmed the deaths of any of them. The death of one general was confirmed by his associate and an officers’ group in Russia. Russia would need 800,000 troops – almost equal to its entire active-duty military – to control Ukraine in the face of prolonged armed opposition, according to Michael Clarke, former head of the British-based Royal United Services Institute, a defense think tank.

""And that if pushed – if we continue pushing him in the corner – he will have no choice, in his view, but to do this."" Russia still adheres to the doctrine of mutual deterrence which makes it less likely he would use a nuclear weapon against the U.S. or a ally, but it remains unclear how the U.S. or would respond if Russia were to use a nuclear weapon in Ukraine.

So she ran outside wearing a fur coat. We collected some things: underwear, documents, money. That’s it, we did not take anything else.

The Kinzhal, which translates to ""dagger,"" is a nuclear-capable missile that has never been used before in combat, and also has the ability to travel at 10 times the speed of sound and a range of roughly 1,250 miles. - An airman checks a Russian Air Force MiG-31 fighter jet prior a flight with Kinzhal hypersonic missile during a drill in an unknown location in Russia, in this still image taken from video released February 19, 2022. : Spokesman for the Russian Defense Ministry Igor Konashenkov said the missile was used Friday to hit an underground warehouse. Fox News Digital has not independently verified the use of the hypersonic cruise missiles that would have been shot from a MiG-31K warplane. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has repeatedly called for the U.S. and to instate a no-fly zone over Ukraine to help stop the more than 1,080 missiles that have been levied from Russian forces. Though U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin said this week that not only does a no-fly zone have the potential to escalate the war beyond Ukraine’s borders, but it would not necessarily prove all that effective. Zelenskyy repeated his pleas this week after a theater in Mariupol housing roughly a thousand men, women and children was targeted by Russian shelling. Russia has routinely used long-range missiles to hit Ukrainian military and civilian targets, but Austin argued that some strikes have come from within Russian borders, making a no-fly zone ineffective.

Ukraine's National Police said Saturday that at least 37 residential and infrastructure buildings were damaged with dozens of reported causalities. Konashenkov on Saturday also said that Russian forces had destroyed military radio and reconnaissance centers near Odessa – a port city in the south of the country – using Bastion coastal missile system, first reported Reuters. The Bastion missile is launched from a vehicle and has the capability to travel at supersonic speeds using satellite and radar technologies to locate its target – making it difficult to defend against.

There will be fresh troops, not particularly better than what's already there, to be frank about it — poorly led, poorly trained, likely having low morale, not knowing why they're there, but they're going to put them into the fight. There's also their best military organization as the first guards tank army based in the vicinity of Moscow. They've had a couple of the smaller elements from them in the fight early on.

Colorado Gov. Jared Polis kicked off a campaign last week to ask police and sheriff’s departments to donate surplus ballistic helmets and other equipment. ""We know that it can urgently be used to help stop Putin and save Ukraine,"" he said. Colorado said during a short collection period, more than 25 state law agencies contributed more than 1,000 helmets and about 840 complete sets of body armor. Gov. Jim Justice in West Virginia directed the West Virginia National Guard and the Department of Homeland Security to help Ukraine by enlisting West Virginia law enforcement to donate surplus body armor. ""In West Virginia, we stand up for what’s right, which is why we stand united with Ukraine in every way,"" Gov. Justice said. ""Our incredible law enforcement officers throughout West Virginia are prepared to answer the call – they are well-stocked to be able to continue safely serving our people and communities throughout West Virginia, while providing this much-needed assistance to the Ukrainians who are bravely defending their home country against Russia. We hope and pray that this initiative will make a difference and that justice will win the day."" In a tweet, Vermont's Governor Phil Scott also called on members of the public to donate body-armor vests in addition to local law enforcement agencies to donate used and expired body-armor vests. In Greenfield, California, the police department announced on Facebook that they would join in the, ""state-wide call"" and send 17 helmets and 15 ballistic vests to the California Office of Emergency Services which would ship them to Ukraine. ""We are extremely grateful to be able to help Ukraine defend their country,"" the department wrote in the post. Gun businesses and nonprofits across the United States are also aiding Ukraine by sending tactical gear. Adrian Kellgren’s family-owned gun company in Florida was left holding a $200,000 shipment of semi-automatic rifles after a longtime customer in Ukraine suddenly went silent during Vladimir Putin’s invasion of the country. Fearing the worst, Kellgren and his company KelTec decided to put those stranded 400 guns to use, sending them to Ukraine's nascent resistance movement to help civilians fight back against a Russian military that has been repeatedly shelling their apartment buildings, schools, hospitals and hiding places. ""The American people want to do something,"" said Kellgren, a former U.S. Navy pilot. ""We enjoy our freedoms, we cherish those things. And when we see a group of people out there getting hammered like this, it’s heartbreaking."" KelTec employee Bobby Cormier looks through lines of rifles, similar to ones being shipped to Ukraine, at their manufacturing facility on Thursday in Cocoa, Fla. : Cocoa-based KelTec's donation is a high-profile example of Americans collecting guns, ammunition, body armor, helmets and other tactical gear in response to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s promise to arm his citizens. But many similar grassroots efforts have been snarled by inexperience with the complex web of regulations governing the international shipment of such equipment. Adrian Kellgren, director of industrial production of KelTec, holds a 9mm 2000 rifle, similar to ones being shipped to Ukraine, at their manufacturing facility on Thursday. Kellgren, who has dealt with such red tape for years, managed to connect through a Ukrainian neighbor with a diplomat in the Ukrainian Embassy who helped him secure a federal arms export license in just four days. That process can often take months. This week, as Congress debated whether to send more advanced weapons and defense systems to Ukraine, workers at KelTec’s warehouse forklifted four plastic-wrapped pallets containing their 9 mm foldable rifles for delivery to an undisclosed -run facility. From there, the shipment’s new recipient, Ukraine’s Ministry of Defense, will be responsible for smuggling the weapons into the war zone. ""That’s when the real derring-do and heroism begins,"" Kellgren said. , But hazards abound: One New York City nonprofit leading an effort to collect tactical gear had 400 bulletproof vests stolen before they could be dispatched. Many of the organizers have no clue how to navigate International Traffic in Arms Regulations, or , which sometimes require approvals from the Departments of State, Commerce and Defense to ship even non-lethal tactical gear. The National Shooting Sports Foundation, a trade group for firearms manufacturers, distributed step-by-step instructions this week to its more than 8,000 members on how to apply for an expedited export license. They also provided a list of specific sniper rifles, pistols and ammo requested by Ukraine’s Embassy in Washington. KelTec hopes to arrange more shipments in the future. Its license allows the export of up to 10,000 weapons and the company has offered the Ukrainians their own production line and weekly shipments. Details of KelTec’s efforts surfaced in a Justice Department filing this week by a Maryland-based real estate lawyer, Lukas Jan Kaczmarek, who said that as a volunteer with the Ukrainian-American Bar Association he is helping Ukraine acquire weapons in tandem with Volodymyr Muzylov, the first secretary at the Ukraine Embassy. ""I expect to work in this capacity for the duration of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and I have not, am not, and shall not receive any monetary compensation for my assistance,"" Kaczmarek wrote in his registration as a foreign agent of the Zelenskyy government. Employee John Marra moves pallets containing a shipment of 9mm 2000 rifles awaiting shipment to Ukraine at the KelTec gun manufacturing facility on Thursday. , ’S KelTec isn’t the only arms manufacturer to have answered the call. Another Florida company, Adams Arms, posted on its Facebook account a video of what it said is a shipment of carbine rifles destined for Ukraine. The company has also started selling T-shirts emblazoned with the iconic final broadcast of a bombarded Ukrainian Border Guard unit that told a Russian warship to ""Go Yourself!"" Proceeds from shirt sales will go to the Ukrainian National Bank’s war funds. While rifles are no match for Putin’s firepower of Sukhoi fighter jets and cluster bombs, they can play an important role if the Russians get bogged down in street-to-street combat, retired U.S. Army Major John Spencer said. The semi-automatic rifles KelTec is shipping are perhaps even more valuable than high-tech, anti-aircraft missiles that require extensive training beyond the reach of most civilians, many of whom have never even held a gun before, he said. ""Every shipment of firearms is critical,"" said Spencer, an urban warfare analyst at the Madison Policy Forum, a New York-based think tank. ""You’re giving one more fighter, out of tens of thousands, the opportunity to resist with a simple-to-use weapon."" Kellgren said he’s been inspired by the resourcefulness and tenacity of Ukrainian citizens and is confident the rifles he’s sending will make a difference. ""The people of Ukraine have had mostly just civilian firearms and they’re holding off a superpower,"" he said. ""So the X-factor here not isn’t necessarily what equipment you’re holding. ... It comes down to the will to fight."" The Associated Press contributed to this report.",49,4.7994160810630895,5.708071695171359,-0.9086556141082696,9

United States Central Command Commander Gen. Frank McKenzie said there was ""little evidence"" that foreign fighters were traveling from Syria to Ukraine as Russia looks to ramp up recruitment for its war. ""We see little evidence of recruiting in Syria to bring people back to Ukraine,"" McKenzie told reporters Friday. ""Not saying it couldn't happen, and I'm not saying that one or two, three or four haven't gone. But we haven't seen the large-scale effort to do that."" 'S ' ' ’S - Syrian army soldiers fire their weapons during a battle with rebel fighters at the Ramouseh front line, east of Aleppo, Syria, Monday, Dec. 5, 2016. The general’s comments were in response to questions on Russian President Vladimir Putin’s reported efforts to have Syrians join the fight in Ukraine. Earlier this month, Syrian news website DeirEzzor24 claimed that Moscow was offering six-month contracts with pay ranging between $200 and $300 a month in a push to increase its force posture in Ukraine. ""We find noteworthy that Putin believes that he needs to rely on foreign fighters to supplement what is a very significant commitment of combat power inside Ukraine as it is,"" a senior defense official told reporters earlier this month. ""They continue to be frustrated by a stiff Ukrainian resistance, as well as their own internal challenges."" The general said that despite its slow progress in Ukraine, the U.S. has not seen any signs Russia is changing its ""force level"" in Syria or other parts of the world, including in Central Asia, where Russia has a significant presence in countries like Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan. ""We have no evidence that the Russians are intent on escalating anything in Syria,"" McKenzie said. But added, ""I think we're well postured for anything that could happen, and we’re prepared for any eventuality."" McKenzie, who is set to retire soon, touched on other top issues for ’s area of responsibility, which includes Northeast Africa, the Middle East along with Central and South Asia. - Syrian soldiers hold up Baath party flags and a portrait of Syrian President Bashar Assad. With its war on Ukraine now in its third week, Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday, March 11, 2022, approved bringing in volunteer fighters from the Middle East into the conflict. : ""Not a day goes by that I don't think about August of last year,"" he said in reference to the chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan that led to the death of 13 U.S. service members on Aug. 26, 2021. ""You go back, and you always try to find ways, things that you could have done different, but I will just tell you this,"" he continued, ""the battlefield is a dynamic place. It is not a business plan. It is a contest of wills. It is a contest of plans."" ""We stopped a number of attacks, we were not able to stop this attack,"" he added. ""I don't know what we could have done that would have prevented this particular attack."" McKenzie drew on the similarities between the war in Ukraine and the Taliban’s near immediate push to overthrow the Afghan government. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has garnered international praise for his refusal to leave Kyiv as Russian forces continue to pummel the nation and security officials warn Putin will look to overthrow him and instate a puppet regime instead. As the Taliban stormed across Afghanistan and advanced on the capital city of Kabul, former President Ashraf Ghani drew international criticism for his decision to flee on Aug. 15. The next day Kabul fell to the Taliban. Russia’s failure to quickly take over Ukraine, despite its sheer size and superior armed forces, has left many questioning why the Afghan armed services were not able to hold off an insurgent group after years of training by U.S. forces. Ukrainian soldiers take positions outside a military facility as two cars burn, in a street in Kyiv, Ukraine, Saturday, Feb. 26, 2022. Russian troops stormed toward Ukraine's capital Saturday, and street fighting broke out as city officials urged residents to take shelter. ""You can train an army, you can equip an army,"" McKenzie said. ""What you can’t give an army is the fighting spirit of an individual soldier."" ""Clearly the Ukrainians have tremendous fighting spirit,"" he continued. ""They’re defending their homes, they’re defending their country."" McKenzie also pointed out that Russian soldiers do not appear ""particularly motivated or engaged in the campaign."" The general said he viewed the failure of the Afghan army to oppose the Taliban as ""not just a military collapse but really a national collapse – ultimately [they] couldn’t find the will to stand and fight."" ""And I’m still digesting that,"" McKenzie told reporters. ""The collapse of the Afghan government was not the result we desired.""",7,3.7898879686805143,6.101722269971422,-2.3118343012909075,4

On Wednesday, President Biden called Russian President Vladimir Putin a ""war criminal"" and Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Thursday agreed, saying that ""intentionally targeting civilians is a war crime."" He said American officials were evaluating potential war crimes and that if Russia's intentional targeting of civilians is confirmed, there will be ""massive consequences.""

Half an hour later, the mother died too. Rosemary DiCarlo, the United Nations’ Under-Secretary-General for Political and Peacebuilding Affairs, reiterated to the U.N. Security Council Thursday that deliberately targeting civilians is against international humanitarian laws and called again for an investigation. DiCarlo called the attacks ""indiscriminate.""

In the besieged city of Mariupol, Russia attacked a maternity hospital, killing at least three people, including a child, last week and rescuers continued to search through the rubble of a theater Friday after the building, where hundreds were sheltering, was destroyed.

They remain approximately 30 kilometers to the east,"" the official told Fox News, noting that Ukrainians continue to put up a passionate resistance.

Mariupol, located in the south of the country in the Donetsk region, has been hit hard by Russian shelling, but Ukrainians are continuing to defend the city.

The U.S. has started to send Ukraine Switchblade drones, which one military expert told Fox News Digital could prove a ""game-changer"" in the defense against Russia’s invasion. ""My understanding of this new drone is that it’s not a traditional drone – what some call a ‘loitering weapon,’"" said Pete Phillips, a retired Marine helicopter pilot. ""It gives you the ability to launch it in a 300 series or 600 series, and the 600 series has a loiter time of about 40 minutes, so you’re looking at the ability to launch this remotely-piloted weapon and have it sit above a battle space."" : ‘ ’ : Fox News confirmed Wednesday that the U.S. will send Switchblade drones to Ukraine after first reported it. The drones, at a cheaper cost, will provide two possible benefits to bolster Ukraine’s efforts: limiting collateral damage and enhancing Ukrainian forces’ guerilla tactics. A new ""kamikaze"" drone that blows itself up -- and takes its target with it -- was revealed at . Made by Textron System, the Battlehawk is similar to Aerovironment’s widely publicized Switchblade. Both are drones that can be carried in a backpack and hand-launched. And they both represent a movement towards making drones more accessible at a squad level. Click here for the full report.

""You can target a vehicle, but say a civilian or non-combatant enters the scene, the user can dismiss the target command."" ""That’s a game-changer,"" he stressed. ""It has the potential to limit collateral damage on the battlefield, but the other great thing is to give the Ukrainian people stand-off capabilities."" , ‘ ’: A user can deploy the weapon from what looks like a launcher tube from virtually anywhere: The mobile capabilities provide a significant enhancement on the Ukrainian forces’ guerilla tactics. The weapon’s smaller size also makes it harder to target despite its loitering capabilities. ""Those are rather large drones,"" he explained, referring to traditional models. ""You’re looking at something the size of a motor tube that we would launch … it pops out and it loiters on the battlefield. , : ""If you didn’t hear it, you won’t see it. You have to be actively looking for them to target them."" The drone itself is the weapon, with the intention that the pilot flies the drone into the intended target, giving it the nickname of a ""kamikaze drone."" ""This is the munition itself. You look at a predator, you need an airfield to launch … you launch [the switchblade], once it hits its target, you’re done. You don’t have to recover it."" Luckily, the Switchblade drone is much cheaper than the traditional unit: The switchblade costs around $6000 per unit versus the millions to build a traditional drone. The U.S. can provide more of the switchblade drones at a cheaper cost that will better supplement Ukrainian forces.",49,6.07895540840934,4.843743309511894,1.2352120988974455,9

2022-03-17,Fox,https://www.foxnews.com/world/us-putin-nuclear-threats-russia-ukraine,US fears Putin may lean on nuclear threats if Russia continues to fail in Ukraine,"—Graphic footage: Fox News correspondent Greg Palkot has the latest on the Russia-Ukraine war on 'Special Report.' U.S. intelligence officials believe Vladimir Putin may threaten to unleash Russia’s nuclear arsenal if Ukrainian defense forces continue to thwart his invasion of their country. Lt. Gen. Scott Berrier, director of the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency, revealed the concerns in a new report on global threats dated March 15 and obtained by Fox News Thursday. ""As this war and its consequences slowly weaken Russian conventional strength, Russia likely will increasingly rely on its nuclear deterrent to signal the West and project strength to its internal and external audiences,"" he wrote. Defense Intelligence Agency Director Lt. Gen. Scott Berrier testifies during a House Intelligence Committee hearing on diversity in the intelligence community, on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., October 27, 2021. : He found that Moscow’s recent adjustments to its nuclear readiness ""are likely intended to intimidate,"" and that the Kremlin could threaten the use of ""tactical, non-strategic nuclear weapons"" to scare an adversary into backing down from conflict through an agreement that would be drafted in Russia’s favor. Berrier also noted that Putin would be likely to threaten use of his nuclear arsenal as a deterrent to third parties. Such a stance is evident in how U.S. and leaders have refused requests from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to impose a no-fly zone over his country that would put Western militaries in direct conflict with Russian jets. Russian President Vladimir Putin attends a meeting of the Supreme Eurasian Economic Council in Yerevan, Armenia. : ' ' U.S. officials believe Putin intends to ""overturn the U.S.-led rules based post-Cold War international order"" and reclaim former Soviet territories. ""Russia views a powerful, survivable nuclear force as the foundation of its national security, and its modernized general purposes forces as critical to meet any conventional military threat and project Russian power abroad,"" Berrier wrote. He noted that Russia spent that last year publicly accusing of increasingly ""encroaching on its borders"" and finds the prospect of a Western-aligned Ukraine ""unacceptable"" and a ""major political-military catastrophe."" However, Putin’s invasion of Ukraine has stalled after three weeks, with Ukrainian defense forces outperforming the expectations of Russian military intelligence, according to Western analysts. The United Kingdom’s Ministry of Defense on Thursday described the Russian invasion as ""faltering"" due to sloppy logistics and poor planning. - , ""Incessant Ukrainian counterattacks are forcing Russia to divert large numbers of troops to defend their own supply lines,"" the ministry said in a statement. ""This is severely limiting Russia’s offensive potential."" As a result, Russian forces are increasingly using ""indiscriminate methods"" of attack – long-range artillery and missiles -- that are leveling cities, killing civilians and damaging infrastructure in retaliation for Ukraine’s effective resistance, according to the report. The also called into question Putin’s credibility on his claims to have ""modernized"" the Russian military. Rescuers work at a site of buildings damaged by a shelling, as Russia's attack on Ukraine continues, in Kyiv, Ukraine, in this handout picture released March 17, 2022. ""Russia’s modernization is intended to ensure Russia can field a military capable of engaging in the full spectrum of warfare to deter or defeat a wide scope of threats, but initial setbacks in Ukraine call some of Putin’s narrative into question,"" Berrier wrote. At the same time, Russia claims it has updated more than 85% of its nuclear weapons and is working on developing missiles that are capable of circumventing Western defenses in order to ""ensure that Russia can credibly inflict unacceptable damage on the West."" Putin often brags about his country’s development of fifth-generation fighter jets, according to the report. ""Russia continues to improve capabilities for its Ground Forces, Airborne Forces, and coastal troops. It is upgrading main battle tanks and introducing new s, artillery, and multiple rocket launchers to its arsenal. Russia has also steadily increased its number of battalion tactical groups —the Ground Force’s primary maneuver element,"" Berrier wrote. ""In 2021, Russia’s Defense Minister claimed its force structure could generate 168 s, which is a 75 percent increase from the 96 s it claimed it could generate in 2016."" Within the next decade, he warned, Russia could also field next-generation nuclear weapons including a new heavy intercontinental ballistic missile, ""a transoceanic torpedo"" and a new intercontinental cruise missile.

A spokesperson for the Kremlin, Dmitry Peskov, responded by saying that Biden's comments were ""unforgivable,"" according to the Russian media outlet . ""We consider unacceptable and unforgivable such rhetoric of the head of state, whose bombs killed hundreds of thousands of people around the world,"" Peskov said. Until Wednesday, Biden had resisted calling the Russian president a war criminal, even as multiple lawmakers called for Putin to be investigated for war crimes. - , , ' ' On Tuesday evening, the U.S. Senate unanimously approved a measure to investigate Putin and other Russian officials for ""war crimes"" and ""crimes against humanity.""

Russian forces have also been accused of using cluster munitions and vacuum bombs in the war, which violate international law when used indiscriminately against civilians. About 700 civilians have been killed since Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24, but the United Nations says the actual number is likely much higher. The International Criminal Court said earlier this month that it is opening an investigation into potential war crimes by Putin in his invasion of Ukraine.

2022-03-17,Fox,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/battle-kyiv-brutal-michael-pregent-jon-sweet,The battle for Kyiv is coming and it will be brutal unless we act now,"Bret Baier, Dan Hoffman and Gen. Keith Kellogg weigh in on President Zelenskyy's appeal for help in his virtual address. It's coming, and it's going to be ugly. Urban battles often are – Stalingrad, Berlin, Hue, Sarajevo, Ramadi. The casualties will be tantamount to World War levels, the atrocities will be numerous, and the outcome will haunt the Western world for decades knowing we could have done more to prevent it. The Battle for Kyiv – the heart and soul of the country, will become Ukraine’s Alamo, with similar results unless we do something now. The parallels to the Alamo are uncanny. A numerically superior force besieging a city that will eventually overwhelm well-entrenched, determined and fiercely patriotic defenders who are prepared to give their lives for their country and their independence. In the military, we call this a Die in Place mission. 'S 'S A - President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is a modern-day James Bowie; Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin is President General Antonio López de Santa Anna. One will fight to the death for the values we as Americans hold dear – life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness, and the other will simply give the orders, from sanctuary, to attack and destroy the city, at all cost. It will be a heroic last stand. Then Putin will become our problem. Russia continues to shape the battlefield, slowly and at tremendous cost, but the Russian Army is closing in on Kyiv. Putin has what Zelenskyy needs – time, numbers and artillery, lots of artillery. This will be a four phase operation: Phase I – Build Combat Power; Phase – Condition Setting; Phase – Assault the Objective; and Phase – Secure a Destroyed Kyiv. The Ukrainian fighters are intuitive, adaptive and formidable. With the right weapon systems, sustained logistics and intelligence, they can take the fight to the Russians. We’re currently in Phase I, as the Russian military continues to lumber toward Kyiv. During this phase, we’ll see the formation of artillery groups capable of punishing Kyiv from a distance, the maneuver units – battalion tactical groups will move into their assault positions, and a much-improved rear area security force will be emplaced to protect their logistical points and routes. Putin has become increasingly frustrated with his military’s inability to secure Ukraine. Throughout Phase I and Phase , we’ll continue to see the build-up of combat power to replace the troops/units that were rendered combat ineffective. If Putin does introduce foreign mercenaries from Chechnya and Syria, we’ll observe their arrival in this phase. Their presence on the battlefield will become a key indicator in the location of the main effort. Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Russia's Vladimir Putin The siege of Kyiv begins in Phase . The Russians will begin with a siege, an operation to deny Kyiv’s defenders food and water, resupply of ammunition, and communications to the outside world. They will knock out the power grid, the water supply, and communication nodes . Lines of communication into and out of the city will be severed and secured. The defenders will be isolated and the rationing of supplies will begin. Reconnaissance and probing of the Ukrainian defenses will be relentless, keeping the defenders in a constant state of alert. Next, the artillery preparation, at a scale not experienced since World War I – Verdun and the Somme. It will be devastating, and will level the city. It will, however, provide the surviving defenders excellent defensive fighting positions during Phase . The key to success for Phase I and is the amount of time given to set the conditions for success in Phase . Putin has become increasingly frustrated with his military’s inability to secure Ukraine; he is not a patient man. Putin so far has not listened to his generals’ advice on setting conditions. Will he continue to ignore their cautions or will he command them to take the city at all cost with the forces they have? At the conclusion of the artillery barrage, we’ll see the initiation of Phase . The ground force will begin their assault on the city, and it will be a slug fest. The fighting will be intense – street to street, house to house, neighborhood to neighborhood, above ground and below ground. Booby traps, improvised explosive devices , grenades, snipers, Molotov cocktails, bayonets, hand-to-hand, and more. Conventional military tactics dictate a 5:1 ratio of attacking soldiers to defenders. Putin isn’t likely to have that number, and must rely upon his artillery bombardment to make up for the shortage. The casualties will be staggering. Despite his assurances on March 8 to Russian mothers who accused him of ""using their sons as cannon fodder,"" he will use conscripts during the initial assault. He can’t afford to lose his professional soldiers, nor his mercenary force. They will exploit success, but not be exposed to urban warfare conditions. The fighting in the city will be intense, and the loss of life will degrade Russian capability, but the cost in human capital of securing the terrain that was captured will also significantly reduce combat power as the Russian Army assaults Kyiv. Failure to secure the terrain exposes the assaulting forces to attacks from their rear. Furthermore, a sizable force must be left outside the city to prevent additional Ukrainian fighters and supplies from entering or exiting the city. The shortage of manpower could be offset by other means – not consistent with the laws of war. War crimes have not been a deterrent during this conflict, or in Syria, where Russia employed chlorine gas, and it’s not likely to prevent him from using illegal chem-bio agents again to gain a tactical advantage. He will believe statements from the White House that ""there are no red lines within the borders of Ukraine."" Terrain denial by use of persistent chemical agents, use of a non-persistent agent to uproot and expose Ukrainian fighters and their defensive positions, and the use of a thermobaric weapon – aerosol bomb, fuel air explosive to destroy hardened fighting positions or command-and-control centers in civilian populated areas – all are violations of International Law. When the city has been ""secured,"" the Russian military will enter Phase of their operations, and thus begin their counterinsurgency phase. The requirement for additional forces to replace those lost in the battle for the city, and now for the security of the country, will further drain Russian resources, but the punishment of Ukraine will be complete, and the message to other non- members delivered. Of course, the enemy always gets a vote, as Putin has learned over the past three weeks. The response to Putin’s punishment of Ukraine will be from the insurgency, and they will exact their punishment over time. Declaring ""mission complete"" in Phase signals the toughest fight is yet to come. A lesson the U.S. learned over two decades in two theaters of combat. The Ukrainian fighters are intuitive, adaptive and formidable. With the right weapon systems, sustained logistics and intelligence, they can take the fight to the Russians. The Stinger missiles , Javelin anti-tank missiles, and 7.62mm ammunition they received have been put to excellent use, interdicting Russian convoys and repelling armor attacks. But if Ukraine is going to weather this storm, they need to eliminate their biggest threat – indirect fires, aka artillery, the ""King of Battle."" It will be the single most casualty producing weapon on the battlefield. In order to degrade this threat, the Ukrainian resistance will need additional assets to reach them – part of that solution could have been the MiG-29s offered by Poland. That decision needs to be reconsidered by Washington. It could derail Phase I and , and possibly keep Phase from happening. We need to give the Ukrainians a fighting chance, level the playing field. In this case, the best defense is a good offense. Let the Ukrainians take the fight to the Russians. As Zelenskyy has demonstrated, Ukraine wins by staying alive.

Additionally, Putin reportedly desires promises related to the ""Denazification"" of Ukraine. Putin, according to the report, is also asking for face-to-face negotiations with Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to hammer out his demands which Zelenskyy has previously stated he is not opposed to.

The demands are in line with previous reporting that stated Putin has told Ukrainian officials he will end his invasion if six major conditions are met. In this photo provided by the Ukrainian Presidential Press Office, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy delivers his speech addressing the nation in Kyiv, Ukraine, ) News of Putin’s willingness to negotiate an end to the war comes as his invasion enters its fourth week and reports have surfaced that morale among some Russian troops is beginning to wane. The U.S. Defense Department has observed Russian forces stalling out in their advance as well as anecdotal instances of sagging morale among the troops. A senior U.S. defense official hesitated to comment on the broad morale of the Russian forces, but acknowledged some ""anecdotal indications"" that morale was ""not high in some units."" ""Some of that is, we believe, a function of poor leadership, lack of information that the troops are getting about their mission and objectives, and I think disillusionment from being resisted as fiercely as they have been,"" the official explained. ""But, again, I want to stress that these are anecdotal accounts."" ""While we’re confident in what we’re picking up, we would not apply that to the entire force that Russia has put into Ukraine,"" the official added. Reports over the past week have indicated a significant slowdown in Russian advance, which may contribute to the anecdotal low morale: Officials have not seen Russia move its artillery ""any closer"" to Kyiv, but that all signs indicate that the forces intend to conduct a siege of the Ukrainian capital city.

Zelenskyy is seeking to extend martial law until April 24 and to require men ages 18 to 60 to stay in the country to fight. Ukraine's parliament is expected to vote on the measure this week. The Ukrainian leader appealed for more weapons to counter Russia’s military. He said Ukraine's forces are rapidly using up weapons and other hardware supplied by Western nations, and he asked northern European leaders to ""help yourself by helping us."" This comes before a 35-hour curfew is to go into effect in Kyiv on Tuesday evening. When Russia launched the war three weeks ago, fear of an imminent invasion gripped the Ukrainian capital, and residents slept in subway stations or crammed onto trains to flee the city. But as the Russian offensive became bogged down, Kyiv saw a relative lull. U.S. officials say Russian forces were about 9 miles from the center of the city as of Monday, according to The Associated Press. But large explosions thundered across Kyiv before dawn Tuesday from what Ukrainian authorities said were artillery strikes. Zelenskyy said barrages hit four multi-story buildings in the city and caused dozens of deaths. The early morning shelling hit the Svyatoshynskyi district of western Kyiv, adjacent to the suburb of Irpin, which has seen some of the worst battles of the war. Flames shot out of the 15-story apartment building and smoke choked the air as firefighters climbed ladders to rescue people. The assault blackened several floors of the building, ripped a hole in the ground outside and blew out windows in neighboring apartment blocks. In a message posted to Telegram, Mayor Vitaliy Klitschko said the curfew takes effect at 8 p.m. Tuesday and ends at 7 am. Thursday. Announcing military command’s decision, he warned that movement throughout the city without special passes was prohibited unless people are headed to bomb shelters. ""Today is a difficult and dangerous moment,"" he said. He said civilians should prepare not to leave home for two days, unless sirens warning of air raids go off. Then, in that case, residents should be prepared not to leave shelters during that time-period. ""The capital - the heart of Ukraine - will be defended!"" Klitschko added. ""And Kyiv, which today is a symbol and outpost of European freedom and security, we will not give up! We will not be brought to our knees! Today the efforts of every Kyivan are important."" Klitschko appealed to the men of Kyiv to ""come back"" and defend their city and said volunteers were needed to build fortifications and prepare and deliver food for defenders and vulnerable citizens. ""Men of Kiev! Come back! We need to protect our city and our future!"" he said. ""Instead of sitting somewhere and sympathizing! Ukrainians have shown the world their courage and willingness to fight for their land. Only together we will survive! Glory to Ukraine!"" The U.N. has described the flood of people crossing into Poland and other neighboring countries as Europe’s biggest refugee crisis since World War . The International Organization for Migration revealed on Tuesday that more than 3 million people have fled Ukraine since Russia invaded, according to The Associated Press. Russian and Ukrainian negotiators also planned to hold a second day of talks as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine reached its 20th day. The Ukrainian government said new aid and evacuation efforts would take place Tuesday along nine corridors around the country, including the Kyiv region. But past evacuation attempts have repeatedly failed amid continued fighting. The International Committee of the Red Cross said an evacuation involving 30 buses was planned from Sumy in northeast Ukraine. The organization said it still had not gotten aid to Mariupol, an encircled port city of 430,000 where local officials estimate a lethal siege has killed more than 2,300 people and left residents desperate for food, water, heat and medicine.

A damaged building is seen amid Russia's invasion of Ukraine, in Kharkiv, Ukraine, March 14, 2022. ""It's advanced, it's capable and they've demonstrated for us their ability to do it,"" he continued. Cyberattacks, a part of modern warfare, can be used against critical infrastructure to turn off utilities, hamper communication and snarl supply lines, according to Kelly.

2022-03-14,Fox,https://www.foxnews.com/world/putin-syrian-mercenaries-dirty-tricks-ukraine,Russia's Putin looks to import Syrian mercenaries to do the 'dirty tricks' against Ukraine’s population,"Former intelligence officer Mathew Shoemaker claims President Alexander Lukashenko is 'attempting to play both sides' between the West and Kremlin. As Russia’s war machine grinds into the third week of its brutal invasion of Ukraine, President Vladimir Putin has launched a recruiting operation in the Syrian Arab Republic in an effort to attract reinforcements for his armed forces. Commentators believe the announcement is in part due to Russia’s poor planning of the war, which has led to many Russian soldiers being killed. Last week a U.S official told News the number of Russian deaths could be between 5,000 and 6,000. Putin and his defense minister, Sergei Shoigu, recently declared that as many as 16,000 combatants from the Middle East will enter the Ukrainian war on the side of Russia. The promised pay, according to news reports, is around $3,000 per month. , ‘ ’ : . ""It appears that Russia has opened 14 mercenary recruitment centers in Syria in territories controlled by the regime of Bashar al-Assad ,"" Theodore Karasik, a fellow on Russian and Middle Eastern Affairs at the Jamestown Foundation in Washington, told Fox News Digital. ""After a short training, the mercenaries will be transported to Russia through the Khmeimim Air Base by two Tu-134 and Tu-154 aircraft to the Chkalovsky Air Base, Moscow region."" : Karasik added that ""We need to be aware that there is an information war ongoing regarding the recruitment of fighters by multiple parties to this conflict. There is some evidence that these fighters will enter into the battle space in greater numbers in the coming weeks."" The battle space, he continued, ""is being prepared for partisan warfare and taking lessons learned from Grozny and Syria are going to be important for all actors. Recruitment drives are robust and supported by state actors."" Service members gather in a square during head of the Chechen Republic Ramzan Kadyrov's address, dedicated to a military conflict in Ukraine, in Grozny, Russia, Feb. 25, 2022. Grozny saw intensive urban warfare conducted by Russian forces during the initial stages of the First Chechen War in 1994-95 and the Second Chechen War in 1999-2000, with some military observers claiming they are now doing the same with Ukraine. Karasik said the recruiting effort is about applying Syrian fighters’ capacity in another theater because of the experience they acquired in the long civil war. ""I think it's a mixed picture because of the multiple groups [in Syria] and how they’ve split and come back together again,"" he said. ""So really, it’s about the quality of the recruits, and what we need to look at next is who are they really sending? Who is signing up for this? How do they guarantee the quality of the fighters?"" Brig. Gen. Ahmad Rahal, who resigned in protest from the Syrian military in 2012 over the policies of President Bashar Assad and joined the opposition Free Syria Army, told Fox News Digital that the Russians will use the Syrian and other mercenaries to carry out the ""dirty tasks"" of fighting in the cities, which will lead to more civilian deaths and it will help them avoid being blamed for the war crimes. ""The Russian army is besieging most of the Ukrainian cities, and now it is taking the appropriate fighting arrangement around the cities, and the next stage will be military operations by storming the cities, and these mercenaries coming from Syria from Assad’s army and Assad’s mercenaries will perform a large part of those tasks,"" Rahal said. He added, ""As a military observer, it is clear that the Russian army had to change its military plans. At first the Russians wanted a classic war, a war of armies, and the task assigned to the Russian army was a lightning and quick operation that President Putin called a ‘special operation’ through which the Ukrainian army would be crushed and then the leadership would collapse political in the capital Kyiv, but this did not happen."" The brigadier general noted that, ""It is clear that the Ukrainian military leadership was a good reader of the military reality and the great difference between the capabilities of the Russian army and the capabilities of the Ukrainian army, so the Ukrainian leadership succeeded in dragging the Russian army into a war of resistance around cities, a guerrilla war, a war of ambushes, and later a street war if the Russian army stormed the Ukrainian cities."" Rahal said his information about the forces coming to fight in Ukraine included the following units: the 4th Division, commanded by Assad’s brother; the Syrian army’s special forces; the republican guard; the 25th division; the Russian backed 5th Corps; and ""the Palestinian Al-Quds Brigade, which is fighting with the Assad army ; and the National Defense Forces militias ."" : ? The Assad regime has been engulfed in war since 2011, when the Syrian dictator launched a violent crackdown on citizens seeking democracy. Russian forces intervened in 2015 to crush the revolt. The Syrian civil war has resulted in over 500,000 deaths. Retired Col. Richard Kemp, who commanded British troops in Afghanistan, told Fox News Digital, ""It’s not clear how many Syrians or other fighters from the Middle East are likely to answer Russia’s call. They will have to be paid significant amounts to volunteer to do so. There is no doubt that among them will be Islamic State jihadists who might be looking to stay in Russia or even travel on from there to Western Europe. They are likely to be disappointed if that is their aim, unless Putin is looking to help some of them infiltrate westwards."" In this image released by the Syrian Presidency, Russian President Vladimir Putin, left, meets with Syrian President Bashar Assad in Damascus, Syria, on Tuesday, Jan. 7, 2020. Kemp noted that ""Middle Eastern fighters will be used to a completely different form of conflict than they will find in Ukraine. They are unlikely to be a match for well-armed and organized Ukrainian forces, but Putin will be happy to throw them away as cannon fodder."" Rahal concluded with this warning: ""As a Syrian general, I refuse to push the Syrians into that war that Putin declared against the peaceful people of Ukraine. Putin wants to achieve political and personal goals at the expense of the Ukrainian people, and this is what Putin did before here in Syria.""",7,5.362004546107463,4.353616537674665,1.0083880084327976,26

Keith Kellogg joined ""Jesse Watters Primetime"" on Monday to offer his latest analysis of Vladimir Putin's war against Ukraine. Kellogg, formerly the national security advisor to Vice President Mike Pence, remarked that if the West won't let Ukraine have additional MiG fighter jets to fend off Kremlin attackers, they should seek projectile-based help from certain -member countries. : The general said two Balkan countries, Greece and Bulgaria, along with fellow member Slovakia, all have S300 missile technology that itself was originally designed by Moscow. Gen. Keith Kellogg, Ret., ""The thing they should do is go to Bulgaria, Slovakia and Greece, which are three nations, and they've got a system called the S300, which is a Russian system that shoots down ballistic missiles and anti-aircraft [projectiles] as well, and put it around those point-targets and defend it,"" he said. Kellogg said the S300 has the ""slant range"" to accurately strike up to eight targets at a distance between Richmond and Washington, , a straight line of about 105 miles. ""It'd be kind of nice to have a Russian system shoot down a Russian aircraft,"" he said. President Joe Biden speaks at the National League of Cities Congressional City Conference, Monday, March 14, 2022, in Washington. Kellogg said Putin's new missile strikes within a dozen miles of the Polish border – and therefore the boundary – are construed as the ex- agent attempting to destroy eastbound supply lines to besieged Ukrainian cities. ""He's trying to shut down the supply lines and the airfields that are in the western part of Ukraine. That's the reason why no-fly-zones are not going to go. But that's why a no-fly-zone would be good, then that's why the MiGs would have been good because the 29 MiGs the Polish Air Force wanted to give to Ukrainians, those are good fourth-generation fighters.""

Keith Kellogg on Russian President Vladimir Putin’s invasion expanding to central, west Ukraine. Vladimir Putin’s strategy is ""escalation without an endgame,"" the White House said Friday. Don’t you believe it. Putin knows what he wants: to catch Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and take Kyiv. As the revealed last week, Putin expected a two-day war. Then came Zelenskyy. Two heroic weeks of unexpected fighting raised hopes, but now the battle for Kyiv is on and Putin is more determined than ever. And there’s very little left for the U.S. and to do, since the alliance is paralyzed by escalation fears. Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Russian President Vladimir Putin Like you, I've watched with grim satisfaction as Russia tripped up on maneuvers, stalled convoys, inept tank tactics and more. The ""video of Russian tank units near Brovary running away will be engraved in the memory of the whole world,"" praised Ukraine’s defense minister on Friday. 'S That phase of Russian indecision is over. Putin is going after Kyiv the ugly way. Putin has cranked up Russian firepower, with more ground-based missiles and airstrikes. Russian ground forces crept closer to Kyiv and the famous ""stalled convoy"" woke up and dispersed into the woods, the Pentagon reported Wednesday. Last week this could have been stopped with airpower. Now the war comes down to a close-in fight. Here’s what to expect. From Putin: Russia’s fighting mode is all about long-range firepower. Russian forces will take up artillery positions of relative safety and fire down on Kyiv. Next, Russia will continue to move smaller armored units – tanks – into Kyiv’s suburbs, heading for roads and bridges and testing Ukraine’s resistance. Look at the map. You can see how Russian forces already form pincers from east and west. Russia will try to choke off supplies to Ukraine’s military. Today, there are still 14 countries sending in supplies by road, rail and air. To the west, Russia will intensify new attacks on remaining airfields and other sites as with the strikes on Lutsk and the military airfield at Ivano-Frankivsk. Don’t forget there are three more nuclear power plants Russia doesn’t hold yet. Putin’s changed tactics and he is no rush. Remember Putin pushed the siege of Grozny from mid-October 1999 until February 2000. It was a lot like Ukraine: massive artillery, reconnaissance patrols, and a bloody ending with Chechen rebels gunned down in a minefield. When it was over, the U\.N. described Grozny as the ""most destroyed city on earth."" From Zelensky: The Ukrainian president's top job right now is to remain optimistic and let Ukraine’s military and civilians see they still have a chance to defeat Russia. On Friday, Zelensky praised Ukraine for holding out 16 days, four times longer than predicted, and encouraged Ukrainians to go ahead with spring planting. That’s optimism! But Zelensky’s military options are dwindling. His best tactic is to continue launching counter-attacks at multiple locations against the Russian tanks and patrols probing into Kyiv. The Javelin anti-tank missiles being successfully used by Ukraine reach about two miles and can be fired from inside buildings. They lock on the Russian target then pop up a few hundred feet to dive down and hit from above. Ukraine’s outnumbered defenders must harass and hit Russian resupply vehicles, too. Ukraine may drag out the fight until top Russian generals tell Putin they need more troops and supplies to take and hold Ukraine. But if Zelenskyy loses contact with supply lines outside Kyiv, he may choose an organized retreat of some Ukrainian forces and government functions out of Kyiv. ""Putin must fail,"" proclaimed British Prime Minister Boris Johnson. It would be nice to hope that the world might somehow intervene to impose a cease-fire. Unfortunately, Putin’s nuclear blackmail took 30 nations off the chess board. On the streets of Kyiv, it will be up to Zelenskyy to win or lose the war.",7,4.410772559548785,3.8746019501014417,0.5361706094473431,29

The top Republicans on the House Judiciary, Foreign Affairs, Homeland Security and Intelligence Committees are demanding answers from White House National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan on the early federal release of Aleksei Burkov, who they describe as a ""notorious Russian cyber criminal."" The letter was sent to Sullivan at the National Security Council due to his role in ""coordinating the interagency process"" due to the involvement of numerous agencies in the matter, a source familiar with the planning told Fox News. : Republicans sent the letter to White House National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan. ) ""Burkov has been described as an ‘asset of supreme importance’ and ‘one of the most connected and skilled malicious hackers ever apprehended by U.S. authorities,’"" Reps. Jim Jordan, Michael McCaul, John Katko, and Mike Turner wrote to Sullivan, in a letter obtained by Fox News. ""In light of the danger posed by Burkov’s activities and President Biden’s statement that Russian cyber attacks against U.S. interests would face ‘consequences,’ we have questions about the Biden Administration’s decision to allow Burkov to return to Russia,"" they wrote. ""We request your cooperation with our investigation into this matter."" Burkov had been imprisoned in the United States for cyber crime, but was deported to Russia in August 2021, before his sentence was complete. ""The decision to prematurely release Burkov is curious given the lengths to which the U.S. government went to secure Burkov’s arrest,"" the Republican lawmakers wrote, referring to U.S. authorities’ years-long pursuit of Burkov ""on hacking-related charges, including identify theft, wire fraud, computer intrusion, and money laundering."" Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan and other Republicans are investigating why, in August 2021, the United States released a Russian cyber criminal early from federal custody. The lawmakers pointed to one of the two illegal websites Burkov ran, called ""Cardplanet,"" which they said ""sold credit and debit card information, many of which belonged to U.S. citizens and resulted in over $20 million in fraudulent purchases on U.S. cards."" ""Burkov operated another website that served as an exclusive ‘invite-only club’ where some of the world’s most dangerous cyber criminals could advertise stolen goods and criminal services,"" they wrote. : ""In December 2015, at the U.S. government’s request, Israeli authorities arrested Burkov. Russia aggressively fought Burkov’s extradition to the U.S. and even attempted to bait Israel in a prisoner-swap by imprisoning a young Israeli woman on exaggerated drug charges during a layover in Russia,"" they continued. ""Despite Russia’s efforts to prevent his transferal to U.S. custody, the Trump Administration secured Burkov’s extradition to the U.S. in November 2019,"" the lawmakers noted, adding that Burkov pleaded guilty and a federal judge sentenced him to nine years in prison in June 2020. At the time of his sentence, the lawmakers noted that Burkov was given ""credit for time served while incarcerated both in Israel and the United States."" ""The Biden Administration released Burkov at least a year early on August 25, 2021 when U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials escorted him onto a plane destined for Moscow,"" the lawmakers wrote, adding that, at the time, an spokesperson stated that ""‘Burkov is wanted by Russian authorities,’ and a spokesperson denied that a prisoner exchange took place."" ""Although a Kremlin spokesperson applauded Burkov’s premature release, calling it a ‘rather positive development,’ current and former U.S. officials have been described as ‘befuddled’ and ‘surprised,’"" they wrote. The United States ""does not have an extradition treaty with Russia,"" they wrote—meaning the U.S. and Russia do not have an agreement that allows prisoners to finish out their sentences in the other nation. ' A ,' The lawmakers added that the Russian government ""has a history of using cybercriminals as assets for Russian intelligence services."" They also warned that ""some former officials have suggested that Burkov may now be working for Russia, against U.S. interests."" ""In light of the Biden Administration’s sudden reversal on Burkov’s case, the potential that he may now be working against U.S. interests, and to better understand the Administration’s efforts to address the pervasive threats posed by Russian cybercriminals, we respectfully request the following information,"" the lawmakers wrote. The Republicans asked for an ""explanation"" for why the Biden administration granted Burkov early release from U.S. custody; an assessment of where Burkov is now and whether the administration believes he is ""appropriately being held accountable for his crimes in Russia;"" and an ""explanation of what, if anything, the U.S. received in return for his release to Russia."" The lawmakers also demanded a list of Russian nations in U.S. federal custody pursuant to criminal charges or convictions since Biden took office in January 2021 who have been released prior to the end of the individual’s criminal sentence. They also requested the charges for which the individual was in custody or convicted. The lawmakers demanded that Sullivan provide the information by March 28. ""If a full response requires the disclosure of classified information, please provide such information under separate cover,"" they wrote. ""After you have provided this information in writing, we ask that you arrange for the to provide a staff-level briefing."" ""The Biden Administration continues to warn about vulnerabilities to Russian cyber attacks against Ukraine and the west,"" a senior official told Fox News. ""Maybe they wouldn’t be in such a precarious position had they not released a major cyber criminal just months ago."" Last month, the Department of Homeland Security warned U.S. organizations at all levels that they could face cyber threats stemming from the Russia-Ukraine conflict. - : '' The Biden administration has worked to strengthen cyber defenses after a string of ransomware attacks last summer, with foreign malign actors targeting pieces of U.S. critical infrastructure. In June 2021, a ransomware assault shut down the U.S.-based meat plants of the world’s largest meatpacker, Brazil-based . The White House said the hack was likely carried out by a criminal group based in Russia. The attack on came just weeks after the largest U.S. fuel pipeline, the East Coast's Colonial Pipeline, was targeted by a criminal group originating in Russia. Biden, during his summit in Geneva with Russian President Vladimir Putin in June 2021, raised the issue of ransomware. Biden, at the time, said he told Putin that ""certain critical infrastructure should be off limits to attack."" Biden said he gave a list of ""16 specific entities defined as critical infrastructure,"" saying it ranged from energy to water systems. Putin, though, during his press conference after the meeting, denied that Russia was responsible for cyberattacks and instead claimed that most cyberattacks in the world were carried out from the U.S. Biden in July signed a national security memorandum directing his administration to develop cybersecurity performance goals for critical infrastructure in the U.S. – entities like electricity utility companies, chemical plants and nuclear reactors. The memo also formally established Biden's Cyber Security Initiative, a voluntary collaborative effort between the federal government and critical infrastructure entities to facilitate the deployment of technology and systems that provide threat visibility indicators and detections.",20,6.90753966903353,7.102356550107809,-0.19481688107427964,8

A new round of talks between Russian and Ukrainian officials raised hopes that progress would be made in evacuating civilians from besieged Ukrainian cities and getting emergency supplies to areas without enough food, water and medicine. Air raid alerts sounded in cities and towns all around the country overnight, from near the Russian border in the east to the Carpathian Mountains in the west, as fighting continued on the outskirts of Kyiv. Ukrainian officials said Russian forces shelled several suburbs of the capital, a major political and strategic target for an invasion in its 19th day. Ukrainian authorities said two people died and seven were injured after Russian forces struck an airplane factory in Kyiv, sparking a large fire. The Antonov factory is Ukraine’s largest aircraft manufacturing plant and is best known for producing many of the world’s biggest cargo planes. : Russian artillery fire also hit a nine-story apartment building in a northern district of the city, killing two more people, authorities said.

While Russia’s military is bigger and better equipped than Ukraine’s, Russian troops have faced stiffer than expected resistance, bolstered by Western weapons support that has frustrated Putin. With their advance slowed in several areas, they have bombarded several cities with unrelenting shelling, hitting two dozen medical facilities and creating a series of humanitarian crises. Ukraine said Moscow's troops failed to make major advances over the past 24 hours.

Since launching its invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, Moscow has waged a multipronged attack and encircled several cities. The fight for the southern city of Mariupol is crucial because its capture could help Russia establish a land corridor to Crimea, which it seized from Ukraine in 2014. The International Committee of the Red Cross said suffering in Mariupol, where missiles struck a maternity hospital Wednesday, was ""simply immense"" and that hundreds of thousands of people faced extreme shortages of food, water and medicine.

""Life-changing injuries and chronic, debilitating conditions cannot be treated."" : Russia also expanded its assault on Sunday to western Ukraine, striking the International Center for Peacekeeping and Security near Yavoriv, a military base which has long been used to train Ukrainian soldiers, often with instructors from the United States and other members. More than 30 Russian cruise missiles targeted the site. In addition to the 35 deaths, 134 people were wounded in the attack, the Ukrainian Defense Ministry said. The base is less than 25 kilometers from the Polish border and has hosted training drills, making it a potent symbol of Russia’s longstanding fears that the expansion of the 30-member Western military alliance to include former Soviet states threatens its security — something denies.

2022-03-13,Fox,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/charge-putin-war-crimes-gregg-jarrett,Charge Putin with war crimes – here's how the world can bring him to justice,": Graphic footage—State Department correspondent Benjamin Hall has the latest from Kyiv, Ukraine, on 'Special Report.' Bombing a maternity hospital, shelling residential buildings, firing on fleeing refugees, and destroying any infrastructure that supports the lives of innocent civilians … are all war crimes under international law. Whoever is involved in the chain of command that gave the orders – all the way up to the head of state – can and should be charged. This means Russian President Vladimir Putin must be indicted for war crimes. Russian President Vladimir Putin There is no question about who issued the orders. The invasion of Ukraine and the cruel bombing campaign cannot be blamed on a rogue Russian general. It was organized and directed by Putin himself. He admitted as much in his maniacal vows to destroy his perceived enemies in neighboring Ukraine. 'S Historically, the gathering of incriminating evidence has been both difficult and time-consuming. Perpetrators cover up their crimes and witnesses are reluctant to speak out in fear for their own lives. But the atrocities in Ukraine are different. On a daily basis, the world has watched in real time many of the war crimes committed by the military forces that Putin controls. Thanks to modern technology, the evidence has been collected by reporters with cameras, as well as Ukrainians on their cellphones or other devices. Satellite images confirm the death and destruction. The compilation and authentication of the damning evidence is no longer an obstacle as it once was. It has already been communicated electronically throughout the world and stored. We have watched it unfold with our own eyes. The appalling video of the bombings as they happened, photographs of mangled bodies of women and children, pictures of mass graves, and the personal accounts of the carnage by those who watched in horror constitute self-evident proof. In the city of Mariupol alone, some 1,200 civilians were slaughtered. That number seems to rise by the hour. The names of the victims and how they were massacred by Putin’s heavily armed troops have been meticulously recorded. The should establish a special tribunal, just as it did for the mass atrocities committed in the former Yugoslavia in the 1990s. In all, 18 health care facilities in Ukraine have been bombed in the Russian onslaught. Stores, schools, apartments, orphanages, markets, pharmacies and private businesses have been obliterated. The measure of human suffering and bloodshed is memorialized in searing images and documents. Putin’s crimes fall into three separate, but related categories spelled out by international law. The first is called ""crimes against humanity."" It is defined as ""a widespread or systematic attack directed against any civilian population."" Invading a sovereign nation without provocation and deliberately killing non-combatants, including women and children, clearly qualifies. So does Putin’s use of cluster bombs and his admitted deployment of thermobaric explosives that rupture the lungs of any civilians nearby. The second is known as ""war crimes."" They, too, involve the willful killing of civilians, inhumane treatment, destruction of property and intentionally causing great suffering. The barbarity of Putin’s military actions meets this definition. Millions of civilians have fled as entire communities have been laid to waste by indiscriminate bombings – their lives and livelihoods shattered. The third offense is identified as ""crimes of aggression."" This encompasses any unjustified attack or invasion by armed forces, bombardment, military occupation of territory and annexation. Again, this has been established. The International Criminal Court in The Hague, Netherlands, has announced that it opened a war crimes investigation. That may sound impressive, but the track record of the court is not. The is notoriously hobbled by inertia, dysfunction, weak management, endless jurisdictional disputes and feeble prosecutions. A better idea is for the United Nations to circumvent the and establish a special tribunal, just as it did for the mass atrocities committed in the former Yugoslavia during the Balkan Wars in the 1990s. In that case, 161 people were indicted for their crimes, including former Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic. Yes, Russia would veto the creation of a special tribunal in a vote by the five-member U.N. Security Council. But the General Assembly has the power to override the veto under a rather obscure provision called resolution 377. The language affords sufficient latitude. A United Nations vote should be undertaken with dispatch and the criminal tribunal organized. Since the evidence already exists, Putin and his cronies could be charged expeditiously. Placing Putin in the dock to account for his heinous crimes is a more vexing matter. The tribunal itself would have no police power to effectuate his arrest in Russia where the dictator is protected – for now. This means it will be up to the Russian people. The case of Milosevic is instructive. Massive anti-war demonstrations against his brutality eventually drove him from office, as up to 200,000 members of his military deserted him. Milosevic was arrested by his own people and carted off to the special tribunal to stand trial. The same fate could befall Putin if the citizens of Russia grow tired of his authoritarian rule and his suppression of their human rights. With economic disaster looming, they may in the near future rise up in anger against him. If Russians continue to suffer the dire effects of their own devolving financial situation and if living conditions deteriorate to unbearable levels, fury toward Putin could grow exponentially. Their willingness to tolerate a tyrant who has rained death and terror on Russia’s neighbor in his lust for power may reach a breaking point. Desperate conditions merit desperate actions by the people. Poverty and hunger drive revolutions. It has happened twice before in Russia in the last century. History could and should repeat itself. It is undeniable that Putin is an evil dictator who continues to commit monstrous acts in Ukraine. No sentient person would argue otherwise. Putin is plainly guilty of the despicable war crimes that I have described. And no, I will not grant him a presumption of innocence. But the special tribunal will. Time is of the essence. Bringing Putin and his comrades to justice must be a top priority.",45,4.582668554847628,4.331424432245973,0.25124412260165485,21

2022-03-11,Fox,https://www.foxnews.com/world/kyiv-russian-invasion-intelligence,US leaders predicted Kyiv's swift fall after Russian invasion. Why were they so wrong?,"Fox News State Department correspondent Benjamin Hall discusses the overnight Russian airstrike that left 21 dead, including 2 children, in Northeastern Ukraine on ‘Special Report.’ As Russia massed a large military presence on its border with Ukraine weeks before launching its invasion, Western intelligence officials were concerned the capital city of Kyiv could fall in a matter of days amid a Russian assault. Now two weeks into the conflict, the capital remained in Ukrainian hands and Russian troops have failed to make substantial progress as opposition forces continue to put up fierce resistance. Russian forces were reportedly trying to encircle the city, but the loss of equipment and personnel has taken its toll and significantly slowed their advance. Meanwhile, Moscow has targeted several Ukrainian cities with devastating airstrikes that have left civilians dead and forced many to flee to neighboring countries. : The predictions that Kyiv would fall, a major Russian objective, represented an intelligence failure, though not a major one, said Rebekah Koffler, a former Defense Intelligence Agency officer and author of ""Putin's Playbook: Russia's Secret Plan to Defeat America."" Part of the misstep by intelligence officials was the influence of previous events, she said, citing the disastrous withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan, the Sept. 11 attacks and the Iraq War. ""They're a little bit influenced by that and they wanted to telegraph to the policymakers the urgency,"" Koffler told Fox News. In early February, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark Milley told lawmakers during a closed-door briefing that Kyiv could fall within 72 hours after a full-scale Russian invasion. He said the operation could result in 15,000 Ukrainian military deaths and 4,000 Russian troop deaths.- : ‘’ That prediction, like predictions regarding how long Afghanistan's army could last without U.S. support, has already been disproved. Kyiv has held out long past the dire prognostication. The war grinds on. Last week, Russia claimed it had lost 498 military personnel, a figure widely disputed by the Pentagon, which put the death toll somewhere between 2,000 and 4,000. Ukraine has claimed nearly 11,000 Russian military deaths and the Kremlin is believed to be actively concealing the true number. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark A. Milley testifies on Capitol Hill, Sept. 29, 2021. The fact remains that Kyiv did not fall, and Afghanistan did not stand, despite Milley's speculations in May 2021 that the U.S.-backed government there could. ""It's not a foregone conclusion, in my professional military estimate, that the Taliban automatically win and Kabul falls, or any of those kind of dire predictions,"" Milley said during a news briefing at the time. ""There's a significant military capability in the Afghan government, and we have to see how this plays out."" Afghanistan fell swiftly to the Taliban after the U.S. military shuttered Bagram Air Base. Milley, along with Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Secretary of State Antony Blinken, was among the Biden administration leaders who green-lit that plan. They are now helping direct the U.S. response to Russia's aggression in Ukraine. The fighting between both sides has moved closer to Kyiv as civilians continue to be targeted by Russian shelling. On Monday, Ukrainian officials claimed to have downed two Russian aircraft over the area and Russian artillery units have shelled the outer portions of the city. From a manpower standpoint, Russia has sent nearly 100% of its combat forces into Ukraine, Defense Department officials said Monday. This is an unusual move: Armed forces tend to keep numbers in reserve outside the theater of combat. In addition, Moscow was recruiting Syrian fighters to back up the Russian army as the Kremlin struggled to contain its losses, along with global condemnation over the invasion and political and economic isolation. Moscow has already reportedly sent Chechen forces to hunt down Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, and those forces have reportedly been eliminated by the Ukrainians. Pete Marocco, former deputy assistant Secretary of State for conflict and stabilization operations, told Fox News that predictions about whether Kyiv would fall to Russian troops came before the Beijing Winter Olympics in February. A woman and her child sit on the pavement in a subway station turned into a shelter in Kyiv, Ukraine, on Tuesday. ""I’m not sure it was an intelligence failure. I don’t know that it was an inaccurate statement to say that it could have fallen within 72 hours,"" he said. ""As time languished on, Ukraine became prepared."" He noted that such dire warnings could possibly be messaged with the intent of spurring one’s allies to make necessary preparations or possibly overcompensating for the miscalculations in Afghanistan. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine came days after the end of the Winter Games, a misstep on Putin’s part, said Marocco. The reason why he waited to begin military operations is left to speculation, he said. Anti-tank constructions are seen in central Kyiv, Ukraine, on Monday. ""I don’t see him as having that sort of sensitivity or caring unless there might have been some sort of tactic or mutual agreement with China,"" Marocco said. ""If he did that, that would be a surprising strategic blunder on his part. I tend to think that there’s another explanation behind the scenes as to why there was this lull before the start. Perhaps to allow predictable sanctions targets enough time to move assets before U.S. sanctions would be put in place."" As the war rages, intelligence warnings of the downfall of Kyiv are irrelevant, said Daniel Hoffman, a retired Senior Clandestine Services Officer. He added that intelligence doesn't make predictions. ""The Russian logistics suck. The supply chain sucks. Zelenskyy has been a hero. Ukrainians have stepped up to fight,"" he told Fox News. ""It's always on a spectrum. You ask some analyst and they would have said: ‘I have a low medium or high level of confidence that the fight could last this long or that long.’"" ""I'm not even sure it's an issue,"" he added. ""It's over. It doesn't matter. The fight's on.""",7,3.749559685305398,3.3745245130102606,0.3750351722951373,0

The Pentagon on Friday warned that Russian troops are starting to make greater advances toward the capital city of Kyiv as Ukrainian forces continue to fight back against a barrage of missile fire. ""There's Russian bombardment and shelling going on quite violently as we speak,"" Pentagon press secretary John Kirby told reporters. ""And we do assess that the Russians are beginning to make more momentum on the ground towards Kyiv, particularly from the East."" Troops and military vehicles deployed in Ozera, northeast of Antonov Airport ‘’ : The news comes as defense officials have been sounding the alarm for weeks that Russian President Vladimir Putin may attempt to encircle the city to overthrow the democratically elected government and install a ""puppet regime"" of its own. Convoys headed for the city have been unable to make major advances since the fighting began over two weeks ago, but the tide could be changing for Russian forces. A Russian convoy north of Kyiv has yet to advance and recent satellite imagery has suggested it has moved off into the tree line. But Kirby prefaced this by saying he did not want to draw too much from the dispersing Russian troops in the north and said, ""That could just be forced protection because the Ukrainians have continued to threaten that convoy and its progress."" Forces northwest of the city remain a threat to Kyiv, but according to a senior defense official Friday, they are still roughly 10 miles outside the city. Putin has deployed roughly all the 150,000 troops he amassed on Ukraine’s border in the lead-up to the invasion and despite the loss of at least 700 Russian military vehicles Moscow has maintained about 90% of its combat force. Members of the Ukrainian military arrive to reinforce a forward position on the eastern frontline near Kalynivka village on March 08, 2022, in Kyiv, Ukraine. : 2.5 Ukraine has also maintained roughly 90% of its fighting forces despite the nearly 810 missiles fired upon it over the last 16 days. Half of the missiles levied at Ukrainian forces have come from Russian troops within Ukraine. Just under half of the missiles have been fired from Russia and roughly 80 have been launched from Belarus, a senior defense official confirmed. Russia has largely focused its invasion in the North, South and Eastern regions of Ukraine. But two cities in Western Ukraine fell victim to Russia’s missile launches Friday. ""Our assessment is that they struck a couple of airfields in the West,"" Kirby told reporters. ""It's not like there hasn't been any airstrikes in Western Ukraine since the beginning of this operation 16 days ago. It's just that we haven't seen that as a routine,"" he added, noting the significance of two strikes in one day.

Thursday’s high-level talks in Turkey between Ukrainian and Russian foreign affairs counterparts ended in no progress for a potential cease-fire or for protecting civilians in the heavily bombarded Mariupol, even after Ukraine suggested a ""neutrality"" proposal with security guarantees from world powers. In the most senior interaction since Russian President Vladimir Putin launched the invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, the failed talks between Ukraine Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba and his counterpart, Russia's Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, lasted just 90 minutes in the Turkish coastal city of Antalya.

2022-03-10,Fox,https://www.foxnews.com/world/russian-struggle-ukraine-military-overestimated,Russian struggle in Ukraine poses question of whether military was overestimated,"National security correspondent discusses alternative actions that could strengthen Ukraine on 'Special Report.' As Russia continues its assault on Ukraine and its major cities amid its chaotic military campaign, the struggles Moscow has faced in attempting to make progress have surprised some experts who predicted Kyiv would fall within a matter of days. Two weeks into Russian President Vladimir Putin's invasion, his forces have been met with a determined and unexpected Ukrainian resistance that has refused to roll over, evident of the Kremlin's inability to establish air supremacy, despite a constant barrage of airstrikes. Its ability to over-perform against a larger and better equipped Russian military is in contrast to what many predicted. Russia outnumbers Ukraine in weapons, troops and has a history of deploying its military to fight in a number of conflicts. Despite this, Ukrainian fighters have been able to launch counterattacks with regularity. : ‘’ A destroyed Russian tank is seen after battles on a main road near Brovary, north of Kyiv, Ukraine on Thursday. Russia was expected to overtake Ukrainian forces within a matter of days but has so far met stiff resistance. Partly to blame is Russia's ineffective planning to coordinate logistics and sustainment efforts and poor leadership, experts said. ""A lot of their problems are logistical and tactical in nature,"" retired Green Beret, George Fraser, told Fox News. ""It’s not that they have bad tanks or faulty bullets as much as a terrible logistics training and lack training or experience in executing battle tactics."" Unlike the Ukrainians, who are fighting for their nation's survival, Russian troops are risking their lives while the world continues to condemn their presence in a neighboring country without provocation. Experts initially believed Russia's ground combat forces would overwhelm Ukrainian fighters. However, its combined arms tactics – the integration of combat arms, infantry, armor and aircraft, working together – has left much to be desired, Fraser said. As the conflict continues to escalate, images and videos posted to social media have given the world a glimpse into what's happening. Many show successful attacks on the ground and air against Russian troops while others have captured abandoned enemy vehicles with depleted tires and equipment. Armored vehicles have so far failed to march into Kyiv, the capital, and Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, which sits a few miles from the border with Russia. A stalled military column of tanks and heavy weaponry spanning 40 miles long that was already moving at a snail's pace has halted its advance just a few miles from the capital. The stoppage has baffled military analysts. A satellite image shows a military convoy near Invankiv, Ukraine February 28, 2022. Satellite image 2022 Moscow's military strategy contrasts with its 2014 annexation of the Crimean Peninsula from Ukraine, Liam Collins, a retired Army Special Forces officer who served as a defense advisor to Ukraine from 2016-18, told Fox News. ""Russia has definitely underperformed, but I don't think it's an indictment on their entire military or that we overestimated,"" said Collins, the founding director of the Modern War Institute. ""In 2014, they seemed to have a war plan for Crimea that they dusted off the shelf and executed to perfection and this time they had months buildup and appeared to have no war plan at all."" Ukraine's stiff resistance is the result of a number of factors, he said, including its 2016 effort to reform its military and millions of dollars in aid and military equipment. Another is the culture of military volunteerism among Ukrainians, as many have decided against fleeing to fight, be it with firearms or Molotov cocktails. Amid its military struggles, Moscow has stepped up attacks on civilian targets, and in the process upending evacuation efforts. ""The Kremlin is bombing schools and hospitals, including maternity hospitals. Moscow does not protect anyone. It destroys,"" Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksiy Reznikov said Thursday. In Mariupol, in Ukraine's east, strikes targeted a maternity ward, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said Wednesday. ""People, children are under the wreckage. Atrocity!"" he tweeted while also asking for a no-fly zone to be established over Ukrainian skies. ""How much longer will the world be an accomplice ignoring terror?"" Despite the missteps, Fraser warned that Russia still has many troops and that it was too early to dismiss their resolve in trying to conquer Ukraine. ""Their performance could lead you to say that you miscalculated how good the Russian army is, but I’d be cautious in that assessment as they have many units left in Russia that may be of higher caliber in reserve for the possibility of a confrontation with were it to happen; but there a lot of things about how they are executing in Ukraine that are not adding up,"" he said. ""I think it’s just miscalculations on everybody’s part about everything,"" he added. ""I don’t know anybody that’s got any prediction right about how this war has played out.""",7,3.843143773047636,4.325761643922435,-0.48261787087479924,10

The director of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs’ information and press department, Maria Vladimirovna Zakharova, said that in the course of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Russia confirmed that Ukrainian leadership was quickly trying to clean up any trace of ""military and biological programs"" that Ukraine was conducting with financial backing from the United States. : This echoed previous accusations that the Kremlin has made about Ukraine allegedly destroying samples of various pathogens. A spokesperson for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy denied the allegations, according to Reuters, and a senior U.S. defense official called the claims ""laughable"" and said they are part of a Russian disinformation campaign.

Will Russia shift its vengeance to the United States? As tensions continue to escalate in Ukraine, many express fears of Russia shifting its vengeance to the United States in the form of cyber warfare. Fox Nation’s ""Russia: The Cyber Threat,"" hosted by Kelly O'Grady, details the dark side of cyber crimes and reveals how just ""a few highly calculated lines of code could cripple the infrastructure of an entire nation."" In President Biden’s State of the Union address, he provided a stark warning to Russia, cautioning them to avoid attacking U.S. industries. However, as more and more countries step up in defense of Ukraine, many fear this means impending retaliation. ‘ ’ Russia – which, according to cybersecurity strategist Danielle Jablanski, is capable of ""the most sophisticated"" cyber attacks – has previously demonstrated its dark capabilities on several occasions. Just weeks before the Russian invasion of Ukraine, 70 government websites were targeted with threatening messages to expect worse. In 2015, Ukraine’s power grid was hit, leaving 230,000 residents without electricity. The hacker was able to gain remote control of the systems, effectively locking out the operator to shut off the power. In another instance, malware spread to millions of computers worldwide after it was ""detonated on Ukraine’s financial sector,"" leading to $10 billion in damages. Recently, Microsoft ""detected wiper malware aimed at Ukraine's government, ministries, and financial institutions,"" O’Grady explained. The company’s detection systems identified the malware and updated to block the infected code, which was later shared with surrounding countries out of caution. ""Without defending against malware like wiper, what we would see is computers we use every day not be accessible, servers that we rely on to provide transactions, or banking, or news information not be available,"" cybersecurity expert Christian Sorensen explained. While no threat of a cyber attack has yet been made against the United States, experts warn to be prepared. ""I think Vladimir Putin is already looking at, hey, how do we retaliate against the United States in the West?"" David Kennedy, cybersecurity expert and former hacker, told Fox Nation. ""We should definitely be prepared both on a critical infrastructure and financials, which are the two main areas that I think will be the first targets of us back here in the United States."" The U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s cybersecurity division has previously responded to incidents that have impacted government agencies, infrastructure, and private sector organizations. ""These hackers, later identified as members of the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service, used privileged access to collect and withdraw sensitive data, and even created backdoors to enable their return,"" O’Grady reported. Russia is capable of disabling or even destroying U.S. satellites, according to cyber experts. This would affect Americans by impacting farming automation, navigation, and oil exploration. Though Russia has capabilities against America, the U.S. is also able to launch attacks of its own. In fact, experts admit they don’t believe Russia would risk engaging the U.S. in a cyber rwar. ""Whether Russia will engage in full-scale cyber warfare against Ukraine and its allies remains to be seen,"" O’Grady reflected. ""In modern warfare, all things are possible. One thing is certain: Russia is a cyber threat.""

Two weeks into the invasion, the Russians have advanced deep along Ukraine’s coastline in what could establish a land bridge to Crimea, which Moscow seized from Ukraine in 2014. Mariupol, which sits on the Azov Sea, has been surrounded by Russian soldiers for days. Sharing disturbing photos on Wednesday showing dead bodies strewn across badly bombed out city blocks, Emine Dzheppar, First Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine, said Mariupol is ""besieged"" by Russia invaders who keep shelling and killing the civilian population of the city.

""We ask to close the sky over Ukraine or provide us with weapon we need and we will do ourselves."" : The Associated Press reported on Tuesday that corpses were lying in the streets of Mariupol and that hungry people were breaking into stores in search of food and melting snow for drinking water. An attempt to evacuate civilians and deliver badly needed food, water and medicine through a designated safe corridor failed on Tuesday, with Ukrainian officials saying Russian forces had fired on the convoy before it reached the city. The Russian military has denied firing on convoys and charged that the Ukrainian side is blocking evacuation efforts. 'S , Natalia Mudrenko, the highest-ranking woman at Ukraine’s U.N.

Nuland said that if there is any biological or chemical attack in Ukraine, ""there is no doubt in my mind"" that it would be carried out by Russia, and that it is ""classic Russian technique to blame on the other guy what they’re planning to do themselves."" This is not the first time that Russia has accused the U.S. of backing biological weapons labs near its borders. In 2018, the Kremlin alleged that the U.S. was funding a secret biological weapons lab in the country of Georgia, which they claimed was one of several labs the U.S. had near the borders of Russia and China.

Turner asked. To that, Haines responded, ""that the threat is increasing, generally yes, I think that’s fair."" ""I absolutely agree that the threat is increasing,"" Burns said. ""I think our role is to try to provide insight from inside the intelligence community into the plans, the ambitions, the pace at which of adversaries – China or Russia – can move on these issues.

The U.S. is conducting a nuclear posture review to look at its own modernization programs and policies, including a missile defense review, while considering the nuclear threat from Russia, China and other authoritarian regimes. Turner said he believed Putin feels ""emboldened"" given the modernization in the nuclear infrastructure in Russia. Separately, China is investing in its fields and hypersonics.

Putin made a public statement in late February that he was putting his nuclear system on a special alert status. Haines said that the remarks were ""very unusual"" and something to be taken ""very seriously."" ""We do think that he is effectively signaling he’s attempting to deter,"" Haines said. Russia chose to conduct planned nuclear exercises, which were postponed from the fall, last month, and Haines reiterated that timing of the exercise in lockstep with the invasion of Ukraine was intended as ""a way to say this could escalate and therefore should not get involved.""

""And we’re not seeing something at this stage that indicates he is doing something different."" If the United States and became directly involved in the conflict in Ukraine, Burns said Russian military doctrine says, ""You escalate to deescalate,"" so he said ""the risk would rise, according to the doctrine."" Referring to Putin, Berrier added, ""I also believe that when he says something we should listen very, very carefully, and maybe take him at his word.""

President Biden, in the weeks leading up to Russia’s Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine, and in the thirteen days since Putin launched the war, has maintained that U.S. forces will not fight inside Ukraine against Russia. Instead, the United States has deployed thousands of troops to Eastern Europe with the intent of defending allies. And while the Biden administration and its European allies and partners continue to provide military aid to Ukraine, the West has, so far, ruled out a no-fly zone over Ukraine, saying enforcing one would put the U.S. and in direct confrontation with Russia and would expand the conflict.

The intelligence community assessed that Moscow would ""continue to employ an array of tools to advance its own interests or undermine the interests of the United States and its allies."" - : '' ""These will be primarily military, security, and intelligence tools, with economic cooperation playing a smaller role,"" the stated. ""We expect Moscow to insert itself into crises when Russia’s interests are at stake, the anticipated costs of action are low, or it sees an opportunity to capitalize on a power vacuum."" The assessment added that Russia ""probably will continue to expand its global military, intelligence, security, commercial, and energy footprint and build partnerships aimed at undermining U.S. influence and boosting its own."" Meanwhile, the U.S. intelligence community assesses that Russia will remain ""the largest and most capable"" rival in weapons of mass destruction to the United States ""for the foreseeable future,"" as it ""expands and modernizes its nuclear weapons capabilities and increases the capabilities of its strategic and nonstrategic weapons.""

The intelligence community also found that Russia believes the expansion and modernization of its nonstrategic systems could ""counter U.S. and allied troops near its border."" The intelligence community also assessed that Russia would remain a ""top cyber threat"" in 2022, as it refines and employee its espionage, influence, and attack capabilities.

""We assess that Russia views cyber disruptions as a foreign policy lever to shape other countries’ decisions, as well as a deterrence and military tool,"" the report states. The intelligence community found that Russia is particularly focused on improving its ability ""to target critical infrastructure, including underwater cables and industrial control systems"" in the United States, as well as in U.S. allied and partner countries.

The also found that Russia presents ""one of the most serious foreign influence threats to the United States, using its intelligence services, proxies, and wide-ranging influence tools to try to divide Western alliances, and increase its sway around the world, while attempting to undermine U.S. global standing, amplify discord inside the United States, and influence U.S. voters and decision making.""

""What he might be willing to accept as a victory may change over time, given the significant costs he is incurring,"" Haines said. Meanwhile, the annual threat assessment was not just limited to Russia, but addressed other global threats facing the United States for 2022, including China, North Korea, Iran and more. ""In the coming year, the United States and its allies will face an increasingly complex and interconnected global security environment marked by the growing specter of great power competition and conflict, while collective, transnational threats to all nations and actors compete for our attention and finite resources,"" the intelligence assessment states. The assessment states that China is increasingly a ""near-peer competitor, challenging the United States in multiple arenas—especially economically, militarily, and technologically—and is pushing to change global norms and potentially threatening its neighbors."" And as many have said Putin’s invasion of Ukraine has emboldened China with regard to its ambition to take Taiwan, the intelligence community warned that Beijing is using a coordinated approach to compel neighbors to ""acquiesce"" to its preferences, ""including its territorial and maritime claims and assertions of sovereignty over Taiwan."" ""Beijing will press Taiwan to move toward unification and will react to what it views as increased U.S.– Taiwan engagement,"" the states. ""We expect that friction will grow as China continues to increase military activity around the island, and Taiwan’s leaders resist Beijing’s pressure for progress toward unification."" The assessment added that China’s ""control over Taiwan probably would disrupt global supply chains for semiconductor chips because Taiwan dominates production."" ""In the South China Sea, Beijing will continue to use growing numbers of air, naval, and maritime law enforcement platforms to intimidate rival claimants and signal that China has effective control over contested areas,"" the assessment states.

2022-03-08,Fox,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/russian-cyber-attack-united-states-prepare,US is running out of time to prepare for a Russian cyber attack,"Former Supreme Allied Commander Gen. Philip Breedlove on Russia attacking civilians fleeing Ukraine. Why hasn’t cyber figured more prominently in Russia’s war on Ukraine? Russia is, after all, a powerhouse in this area having successfully cyber-attacked Estonia in 2007, Georgia in 2008, and Ukraine in 2015-2016. Add to that an unexpectedly difficult start to the current, long-planned campaign against Ukraine and the question becomes even more perplexing. Analysts have many and varied views on the matter and recent reporting has laid out almost a dozen different potential explanations. Some suggest there is no need to go there, and that the possible downside outweighs any upsides. Others suggest that Putin may still go there - just not yet. : The latter explanation is compelling if only because it requires us not to let down our guard and to continue marching forward on plans to expand and deepen America’s own cyber resilience posture and abilities to withstand cyber and electronic warfare. The good news is that certain key sectors that represent critical infrastructure and support vital national functions have been enhancing their defenses for years. Think financial services and energy for example. Aleksander, 41, presses his palms against the window as he says goodbye to his daughter Anna, 5, on a train to Lviv at the Kyiv station, Ukraine. Natali Sevriukova reacts next to her house following a rocket attack the city of Kyiv, Ukraine. President Vladimir Putin attends a meeting with Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu at the Kremlin, in Moscow. The bad news is that other equally important sectors are nowhere near as prepared. Think water - which is working to up its game but is nowhere near where it needs to be as the recent spate of ransomware has made clear. And this is the state of play among the big dogs. Yet the U.S. is an incredibly target-rich environment for any adversary because of the sprawling decentralized nature of both its public and private sector. Put differently: Small and medium size enterprises are not outside the crosshairs. : 'S Officials have been working hard to raise awareness and offer assistance to both public and private entities that may not have the resources or ability to properly protect themselves on their own in the current climate that is so rife with potential cyber threats. The Department of Homeland Security’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency has been doing yeoman’s work in this area. But the scope of the challenge is enormous. So where should we go from here? We must better marshal our efforts so that the piecemeal and uneven progress that has been made to date becomes a more streamlined national effort that makes it far harder for any adversary to achieve its ends. Having a National Cyber Director to act as coordinator and definitively take point on the all-important task of prioritizing our game plans and facilitating their execution in a way that ensures that they will be more than just the sum of their parts is a true step forward. But the will not be able to go it alone. Public and private efforts must cohere and partnerships must be more meaningful than ever before. It’s a tall order but the Joint Cyber Defense Collaborative under auspices is a powerful tool that could rise to the challenge if all stakeholders determinedly make that their mission. Among its payoffs could be better situational awareness than the nation has ever had - and coordinated operations that give bad actors a serious run for their money. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy addresses the nation in Kyiv, Ukraine. We may not yet be where we need to be, but we can’t take our eyes off the ball. So far the conflict in Ukraine may not have unfolded exactly as Russia thought it would; but these are still early days in what is likely to be a long and punishing war. Longtime expert Putin-watchers underscore that he may lash out further should he feel cornered. He has already made an implied threat concerning the use of nuclear weapons. And now Russian forces claim to have taken over a nuclear plant in Ukraine - the largest such plant in Europe. What comes next is anybody’s guess. But forewarned is forearmed. Let’s push down the path to better preparedness as fast and hard as we can so that we don’t end up regretting that we missed our chance to do so.",20,4.434421609916705,4.023888872866556,0.4105327370501488,28

2022-03-07,Fox,https://www.foxnews.com/world/ukraine-russia-conflict-war-crimes,Ukraine-Russia conflict: War crimes of the last century,"Fox News correspondent Mike Tobin has the latest developments as Ukrainians flee country. The International Criminal Court opened an investigation into possible war crimes after Russian President Vladimir Putin approved a ""special military operation"" in Ukraine Feb. 24, a somber reminder of the number of war crimes committed over the last century. The United Nations says that war crimes must occur during an armed conflict, and examples may include murder, cruel treatment and torture, taking of hostages, intentionally directing attacks against the civilian population, and more. One expert previously told Fox News Digital that the will investigate potential war crimes committed by individuals. ""With respect to the situation in Ukraine, the prosecutor may investigate allegations of war crimes, crimes against humanity and the crime of genocide,"" Dustin Lewis, research director at the Harvard Law School Program on International Law and Armed Conflict, said. : Russian President Vladimir Putin attends a meeting with Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu at the Kremlin, in Moscow on February 14, 2022. ) ""The is empowered to exercise jurisdiction only over natural persons. In other words, it may institute proceedings only against individual humans. The has no jurisdiction over the entities with which those humans may be affiliated, such as a government or a military,"" he added. Here's a look at some war crimes of the past century: Armenian Genocide From 1915 to 1916, hundreds of thousands of Armenians died after the Ottoman Turks began mass deportations from eastern Anatolia, which resulted in mass numbers of people dying from starvation or disease, according to the . Before beginning the mass deportations, the Young Turk regime hanged hundreds of Armenians in the streets of Istanbul, according to Yale University. The International Association of Genocide Scholars estimates that the number of deaths were ""more than a million,"" but that number is disputed. Armenians claim that the number of deaths is 1.5 million, while the Republic of Turkey says that it's 300,000. Multiple senior Ottoman officials were tried in connection with the genocide. For example, Mehmed Kemal, a local governor, was found guilty at the trial and was hanged for his involvement in the mass killing of Armenians, according to the report. While Turkey doesn't deny the staggering number of Armenian deaths, its government says that the ""Armenian deaths do not constitute genocide,"" according to Radio Free Europe. People lay flowers at the Armenian Genocide Memorial Complex on Tsitsernakaberd Hill on Armenian Genocide Remembrance Day, which commemorates to commemorate the victims of the Armenian Genocide in the Ottoman Empire. German War Crimes during World War While many war crimes were committed during World War , the most heinous was the Holocaust, when the Nazi German regime killed six million European Jews. Nazi leader Adolf Hitler considered the Jews an inferior race who were a threat to German racial purity, and enacted laws that targeted Jews, excluding them from German society, according to the United States Holocaust Museum. In September 1941, every person designated as a Jew in Nazi Germany was required to wear a yellow star, which made them a target, according to History.com. Between 1941 and 1945, during World War , Nazi Germany began the Holocaust death camps, where six million Jews were killed. Officials in Germany transported Jews to these death camps, where they were deprived of food, water, bathrooms, heat, and medical care, according to the United States Holocaust Museum. It wasn't until May 1945 when the Holocaust came to an end, when the Allied Powers began to overrun concentration camps and then liberate those who had survived, according to the museum. Algerian War The Algerian National Liberation Front fought France between 1954 and 1962 in the Algerian War, and historians estimate that around 250,000 to 300,000 Algerians died during the war, the University of North Carolina says. In 1954, the National Liberation Front launched a number of armed revolts throughout the country and demanded that the nation be declared independent, and France sent troops to the country to monitor the situation, according to the Atlantic. By August 1945, the National Liberation Front targeted civilians and incited a mob that killed more than 120 people, according to the report. In response, French troops and ""vigilante committees"" killed between 1,200 and 12,000 Muslims. After years of battles and hundreds of thousands of civilians killed, the French declared a ceasefire and the Algerian people voted to become independent of France in 1962. One French officer, Paul Aussaresses, admitted to torturing as well as killing Algerian prisoners of war, according to the . A French court convicted Aussaresses of defending the usage of torture in 2002. The post-war amnesty prevented Aussaresses and others from being tried for war crimes, according to the . Russo-Georgian War The Russo-Georgian war began on August 8, 2008, when Russian forces moved into Georgia and began the first war in Europe of the 21st century, according to the Atlantic Council. During the conflict, which lasted five days, several hundred civilians and military members died, according to the Brookings Institute, but the fighting displaced between 100,000 and 200,000 individuals. The International Criminal Court opened an investigation into war crimes committed during the war, but has faced several challenges. The European Court of Human Rights ruled in January 2021 that Russia was responsible for several human rights violations during the war, which includes murdering Georgian civilians, as well as looting and burning homes, according to the Guardian.

The war, which lasted 20 months, killed an estimated maximum of 100,000 people. It lasted from 1994 to 1996.

During that summer, the Chechen rebels battled in Dagestan in an attempt to create an Islamic state. The second war went from 1999 to 2000, with Russia declaring direct rule over the country. Human Rights Watch alleged that Russian forces committed ""grave abuses,"" which include war crimes, during the war. In a hearing before the U.S. Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, Peter Bouckaert, a researcher at Human Rights Watch, presented evidence of the war crimes. Bouckaert stated that Russian forces conducted a ""carpet-bombing campaign,"" which resulted in the ""vast majority"" of civilian deaths during the war. ""The Russian forces have used powerful surface-to-surface rockets on numerous occasions, causing death tolls in the hundreds in the Central Market bombing in Grozny and in many smaller towns and villages,"" Bouckaert said. He added that Russian forces turned much of Chechnya into a ""wasteland.""",45,6.073201799883958,4.384561904556195,1.6886398953277633,21

Lt. Col. Daniel Davis analyzes Russia's military strategy as Putin moves to take control of Ukrainian nuclear facilities. Historic corruption in Russia may have hit its military and eroded its ability to maintain its war efforts in Ukraine. Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24, and the war has not unfolded the way Russian President Vladimir Putin would have wanted. The British Ministry of Defense and U.S. officials regularly note that the Russian military has made slow progress, taking several days to even address day-one targets. 'S , : But more troubling for Russian troops would be the shortcomings in supplies and equipment: Pictures on social media indicate that troops carried rations that had expired in 2015, and the equipment appears dated, with radio communications transmitting over open channels and lacking long-range capabilities. Tanks and vehicles abandoned during combat show evidence of poor maintenance and care. - Russian 2S35 Koalitsiya- self-propelled howitzers roll toward Red Square during the Victory Day military parade in Moscow, Russia, Sunday, May 9, 2021, marking the 76th anniversary of the end of World War in Europe. The Russian invasion of Ukraine is the largest conflict that Europe has seen since World War , with Russia conducting a multi-pronged offensive across the country. The Russian military has pummeled wide areas in Ukraine with air strikes and has conducted massive rocket and artillery bombardment resulting in massive casualties. Russian army soldier wearing a face mask to protect against coronavirus infection marches during a military parade rehearsal in St.Petersburg, Russia, Wednesday, June 17, 2020. The military parade marking the 75th anniversary of the victory in World War was rescheduled from the Victory Day in May 9 to June 24 due to coronavirus pandemic. Russian soldiers dressed in Red Army World War winter uniforms wait to take a part in a reconstruction of a World War -era parade in Moscow's Red Square, Russia, on Thursday. The Russian Federation budgets for roughly $60 billion to $70 billion per year to fund its military, which helps finance salaries and training costs, maintain gear and facilities and develop or buy new weapons, gear and vehicles. If the military is not translating that into its war effort, it raises questions about whether Russia’s corruption has undermined its combat ability. Rebekah Koffler, a former Defense Intelligence Agency officer, said that Russia has a habit of holding onto outdated equipment, but corruption is ""absolutely"" affecting everything, including the military, with both private businessmen and the mafia taking cuts. , 10 ""Corruption is so rampant,"" Koffler told Fox News Digital. ""There’s not the same scrupulousness in Russia – it’s former Soviet Union, and it’s not even in the culture to check the expiration because no one would trust it anyways."" The setup in Russia between the oligarchs – billionaires who control whole sections of Russian industry – and the mafia is fairly unique compared to the West. Retired U.S. Army Lt. Gen. Thomas Spoehr told Fox News Digital that while there is no specific organized crime ring in the military, it’s ""certain"" organized crime operates in the Russian military to some degree. ""We talk about how the U.S. military is a reflection of U.S. society, and we had this issue with gangs in the military not terribly long ago,"" Spoehr explained. ""By that same notion, it would be astonishing if there wasn’t organized crime in the Russian military because Russian society is rife with organized crime. It’s almost like another economy the way Russia operates."" He said the Russian military prioritizes its navy over its army, which may contribute to the poor rations and guns seen on social media. But he added that while the Russian military ostensibly acquires new weapons and equipment through its bureau of acquisitions, there is no doubt ""a certain amount of corruption."" - : ""There is graft, malfeasance, all those kinds of things,"" Spoehr said. ""So people are skimming off the top, maybe in some cases accepting shoddy goods, sometimes enriching themselves by directing contracts to their favorite oligarch – all that stuff happens."" But Spoehr stressed that strategic issues and logistical shortcomings are likely more responsible for Russia’s shocking performance in Ukraine than any possible corruption. Dan Hoffman, a Fox News contributor and former station chief in Moscow, argues that we can’t know to what degree corruption has impacted the Russian military – only that the troops are ""challenged"" and cannot say what the cause is. He argued it is just as likely that the planned revitalization of supplies and forces following the Georgia invasion in 2008 never took hold as it should have, or it could be that the military hadn’t tried to stage a full invasion since World War and wasn’t prepared for the realities of such an operation.",7,5.403962632006564,3.9961765254053137,1.4077861066012507,14

Thirty percent of the population in Estonia and Latvia, both are Russians. And so I can see him trying to create problems in the Baltic countries, but I don't see him invading, and I would just make one final point. I think that what's really important here are the troops that the United States has sent, and it's not just the 101st Airborne and the 82nd Airborne, it's sending heavy armored brigades.

Ukraine is full of patriots who want democracy. Vladimir President Vladimir Putin ordered Russia’s all-out invasion of Ukraine only eight months after magazine billed President Biden as ready to take on the Russian leader. The city fight is familiar ground for Putin. He craves this battle. Twisted Putin thinks he will become greater than Lenin and Khrushchev by standing up for Russia and taking back all of Ukraine. World opinion on casualties won’t affect him. A Russian flag over smoking rubble is his goal. , 'S President Biden and Europe and the world have at most a few days left to make sure Ukraine's fighting forces are supplied for what lies ahead. It may soon be down to hours. Tanks are already probing Kyiv suburbs. At some point, the Russian convoy north of Kyiv will move down to encircle the city. A cultural and community centre, which locals said was destroyed by recent shelling, as Russia's invasion of Ukraine continues, in the settlement of Byshiv in the Kyiv region, Ukraine March 4, 2022. First, Ukraine must keep a supply route open out to the west even under attack. Fighting for Kyiv will consume Ukraine’s weapons and supplies, fast. Ukraine’s armed forces claim they’ve destroyed many Russian tanks and vehicles, which is good, but it also means they are using up Javelin anti-tank missiles. The U.S. and should do whatever it takes to help Ukraine hold airfields and roads in Ukraine’s west. Few Russian forces are in that area so far. Next, Ukraine says they are going on the counter-offensive. As the Russian convoy north of Kyiv moves south, they must pick their targets carefully. Yes, Ukraine should strike Russian tanks, but their overall aim should be to break up and harass Russian formations by hitting resupply vehicles, too. , U.S. Ukraine can also disrupt Russian command and control. For example, that Russian supply convoy north of Kyiv has a mobile command post, with officers near it, and a known electronic signature squawking out even if they try to mask it. All are targets. Of course, Ukrainian forces will find their own communications disrupted by street-to-street fighting around buildings and by Russian electronic warfare. The U.S. and can help, with links to up to satellites, drones or other radio relays to stay in contact. The one thing that would stop Putin from taking Kyiv is a strong no-fly zone. All week Zelensky and his officials have repeatedly asked for help to ""close the skies."" The answer’s been no. If Kyiv is encircled, it’s not over. Ukraine’s defenders may end up attacking Russian forces in the city while other Ukrainian forces hit the siege lines from outside. Senior Russian commanders know in their bones that a pitched fight in Kyiv will be hell. The Russian army in 1942-1943 swallowed up entire German divisions at Stalingrad. Today’s Russian generals had grandfathers and great-grandfathers in that fight. Their defense of Stalingrad was glorious. Now the tables are turned. The Russians invading Ukraine are on the wrong side morally – and tactically. If keeps helping, Russia will lose the city fight. A man stands next to a burnt car near a cultural and community centre, which locals said was destroyed by recent shelling, as Russia's invasion of Ukraine continues, in the settlement of Byshiv in the Kyiv region, Ukraine on March 4, 2022. Many wonder if direct U.S. and military help to Kyiv under siege risks nuclear escalation. Considering the long history of and Russian nuclear confrontation, I'd say no. Putin will do anything to take Kyiv – except nuke it. Here’s why. A Russian tactical nuclear strike would affect Russian forces as well as Ukrainians. Remember also that Putin intends to ""save"" and occupy Ukraine. Radiation is not part of his plan. And for all his veiled threats, Putin knows full well that the extended nuclear deterrence endorsed by every U.S. President since Truman is still in place.

At least one cluster munition strike hit a hospital, killing four and injuring 10. The first Geneva Convention in 1864 outlawed assaults on medical personnel on the battlefield.

So rather than speculating about what that might indicate, I would just tell you that we've seen them, but we can't confirm those reports."" Cluster munitions are explosives that contain smaller bombs. They can strike wide areas and raze entire civilian neighborhoods.

Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg accused Russia on Friday of using cluster bombs in its ongoing invasion of Ukraine, reaffirming humanitarian concerns during the conflict’s ninth day. Speaking at a news conference in Brussels, on Friday afternoon, Stoltenberg said Russian forces deployed banned weapons, including cluster bombs, and called the Russian invasion of Ukraine ""a blatant violation of international law."" : ""We have seen the use of cluster bombs, we have seen reports of use of other types of weapons which will be in violation of international law,"" he said, ""and of course allies and partners are collecting information and are monitoring very closely what is going on in Ukraine."" He added: ""This is brutality. This is inhumane."" Cluster bombs are effectively explosives that, once deployed, open in the air and release more submunitions, or ""bomblets."" They are dispersed over a large area, intended to unleash destruction on multiple targets at once. Cluster bombs can be delivered by planes, artillery and missiles, according to the International Committee of the Red Cross. - : ' ' Beyond the initial harm caused by the munitions upon impact, bomblets have a high rate of failure to explode, up to 40% in some recent conflicts, according to the . That leaves swaths of land dotted with bomblets that could explode. Return to normal life in those areas becomes hazardous, particularly in heavily populated areas. Some formerly war-torn countries spend years trying to clear unexploded cluster bomblets. While using cluster bombs is not a violation of international law, using them against civilians is.

2022-03-04,Fox,https://www.foxnews.com/world/russia-ukraine-war-weapons,Weapons used in the Russia-Ukraine war,"Global Guardian Dale Buckner says that his organization has experienced multiple ‘brush-ups’ with Russian forces near Ukrainian checkpoints. The Russian invasion of Ukraine is the largest conflict that Europe has seen since World War , with Russia conducting a multi-pronged offensive across the country. The Russian military has pummeled wide areas in Ukraine with airstrikes and has conducted major rocket and artillery bombardments, resulting in large numbers of casualties. Here is a look at some of the weapons being used in the conflict. -: In this frame grab provided by Russian Defense Ministry press service, a long-range Kalibr cruise missile is launched by a Russian Navy ship in the eastern Mediterranean, Friday, Aug. 19, 2016. The Russian military has used warplanes and Kalibr cruise missiles to hit facilities throughout the country. The Kalibr is a precision weapon, but Ukrainian military facilities and government buildings apparently targeted by those missiles in Kyiv and Kharkiv are located close to residential areas, resulting in civilian casualties. The same applies to missiles carried by Russian warplanes, which targeted military infrastructure in strikes that also involved collateral damage. To hit key targets, the Russian military also has used Iskander missiles that have a range of up to 500 kilometers and carry a much more powerful warhead that can destroy big buildings and some fortified facilities. Some Iskander missiles were reportedly fired from the territory of Russian ally Belarus, which has served as a staging ground for the Russian invasion. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and other officials have accused the Russian military of indiscriminately shelling residential buildings, schools and hospitals around the country. In this image taken from footage provided by the Ukrainian Defense Ministry Press Service, a Ukrainian soldiers use a launcher with Javelin missiles during military exercises in Donetsk region, Ukraine, Wednesday, Jan. 12, 2022. - : ‘ ’ Images from Ukraine's second-largest city of Kharkiv that were verified by The Associated Press showed what appeared to be a barrage of Russian rockets hitting residential buildings in an attack that killed and wounded scores of civilians. The Soviet-designed Grad , Smerch and Uragan multiple rocket launchers are designed to fire a salvo of powerful rockets to destroy concentrations of troops or military equipment. Their use against populated areas inevitably causes heavy casualties and major damage to civilian infrastructure. The Russian military also has a wide range of powerful Soviet-designed artillery units, which were bizarrely named after flowers, such as self-propelled 203-mm Peony and 152-mm Hyacinth and Acacia self-propelled howitzers. Moscow has claimed it was only targeting military bases and infrastructure, but the has documented massive damage to civilian infrastructure and residential areas in Kyiv, Kharkiv and numerous other cities and towns across Ukraine. Russian officials have alleged that Ukrainian forces have widely deployed heavy weapons in residential areas to use civilians as shields, a claim that couldn't be independently verified. The U.N. human rights chief, Michelle Bachelet, speaking at the Human Rights Council in Geneva on Thursday, said ""most civilian casualties were caused by the use of heavy artillery, multi-launch rocket systems and air strikes in populated areas, with concerning reports of use of cluster munitions striking civilian targets."" She didn't specify which side may have used them. In this photo taken from video provided by the Russian Defense Ministry Press Service on Tuesday, Feb. 15, 2022, a self-propelled artillery mount fires at the Osipovichi training ground during the Union Courage-2022 Russia-Belarus military drills in Belarus. In this photo taken from video provided by the Russian Defense Ministry Press Service on Friday, Jan. 28, 2022, Russian troops fire howitzers during drills in the Rostov region during a military exercising at a training ground in Rostov region, Russia. Ukrainian officials have accused Russia of using cluster munitions, accusations the Kremlin has denied. Such weapons are designed to target enemy troops and weapons over a broad area, and their use in populated areas inevitably would lead to mass casualties among civilians. Cluster bombs, rockets and artillery shells open in the air, releasing submunitions, or ""bomblets,"" that are dispersed over a large area and simultaneously hit multiple targets. Beyond the initial impact, bomblets have a high rate of failure to explode, posing a long-time threat of killing and maiming people for a long time after they were fired. Thermobaric weapons consist of a fuel container and two separate explosive charges, with the first detonating to disperse the fuel particles and the second igniting the dispersed fuel and oxygen in the air, creating a blast wave of extreme pressure and heat that creates a partial vacuum in an enclosed space. That makes the weapon particularly deadly for people in an enclosed space. : ‘ ’ The Pentagon has said that Russian mobile launchers for thermobaric weapons were spotted inside Ukraine, but couldn't confirm their use. The Ukrainian military has relied on the same assortment of Soviet-built multiple rocket launchers and howitzers that the Russian military has. It doesn't possess sophisticated long-range precision weapons like Russia's Iskander ballistic missiles and Kalibr cruise missiles. In this photo taken from video and released by the Russian Defense Ministry Press Service on Friday, Feb. 4, 2022, multiple rocket launchers fire during the Belarusian and Russian joint military drills at Brestsky firing range, Belarus. The Ukrainian military has Soviet-era Tochka-U short-range ballistic missiles, which have a powerful warhead but poor precision compared to the latest Russian weapons. In addition to its aging Soviet-made arsenals, Ukraine has received large shipments of Western weapons, such as U.S.-made Javelin anti-tank missiles and shoulder-launched Stinger anti-aircraft missiles. Ukrainian officials said the country's military has used them to inflict heavy casualties to the invading Russian forces.",49,3.9675752960101995,4.397540984828959,-0.4299656888187595,18

Hundreds of civilians have been killed since Russian forces started bombing populated areas across Ukraine, according to numerous reports. At least one cluster munition strike hit a hospital, killing four and injuring 10. ""There were two children, I believe, who were killed and two others and six injured because of the explosive force of the bomb,"" said Leonard Rubenstein, the director of Johns Hopkins University's Program on Human Rights, Health and Conflict. ""The law is very simple and clear and goes back 150 years that it's illegal to attack a hospital, a patient, medical staff,"" he told Fox News. ""In fact, they're war crimes."" , The first Geneva Convention in 1864 outlawed assaults on medical personnel on the battlefield. Since then, Russia has avoided punishment despite repeatedly violating these terms, according to Rubenstein. A view of damaged building after the shelling is said by Russian forces in Ukraine's second-biggest city of Kharkiv on March 3, 2022. ""Russia has a long history of attacking hospitals,"" the human rights lawyer told Fox News. ""They did it in Chechnya, attacked multiple hospitals in the capital during the war in there 20 years ago."" ""More recently, in Syria, they targeted hospitals in Idlib, in the northwest, in Aleppo and destroyed many hospitals,"" Rubenstein added. The United Nations found that ""pro-government"" forces in Syria carried out aerial and ground attacks in 2020 on civilian markets, refugee camps, and most notably hospitals. The attacks on civilian populations included the use of cluster munitions, similar to the Russian use of cluster munitions on Ukrainian civilian areas, according to the report. Cluster munitions are explosives that contain smaller bombs. They can strike wide areas and raze entire civilian neighborhoods. This image released by the Syrian Presidency shows Russian President Vladimir Putin, center, meeting with Syrian President Bashar Assad, right, in Damascus, Syria on Tuesday, Jan. 7, 2020. ""The pattern of indiscriminate attacks amounts to a war crime just as a deliberate attack is,"" Rubenstein said. ""So if these are confirmed after investigation – and of course, we don't have those investigations yet – they could be war crimes."" ' ,' When hospitals are attacked, the people who suffer most are the patients, Rubenstein told Fox News. ""As long as the fighting goes on in the cities, they will not be able to get staff to come to work, patients won't be able to get there, supplies won't be able to get there,"" he said. Some of the most commonly forgotten war casualties are those with chronic diseases who cannot receive treatment, he said.

""Their condition gets worse, and they may even die just for fear of coming to a hospital that can be attacked."" Still, Rubenstein pointed to a silver lining. ""In Ukraine, there's actually an opportunity, because unlike in other cases, this case could go to the International Criminal Court without going through the Security Council, where Russia has a veto,"" he told Fox News. Russia has vetoed more votes on the U.N. Security Council than any other member, according to a watchdog report. Recently, Russia has blocked investigations into war crimes committed in the Syrian civil war. ""Here, the criminal court has already started an investigation because it has the power to do so and these attacks on hospitals have to be included in that investigation,"" Rubenstein said.",45,3.0352880673227065,4.175795806965868,-1.1405077396431618,21

Roughly 90% of Russia's 150,000-strong force – built up along Ukraine’s border in the lead up to the invasion – is believed to have entered Ukraine from the north, east and south. Despite repeated efforts by Russian forces to make it to Kyiv, a 40-mile-long convoy headed straight for the capital city has been stalled for three days. Reports have surfaced suggesting that everything from weather to mechanical errors have halted its progress and Russian troops remain roughly 15 to 20 miles outside of Kyiv. ""We certainly believe it is their intent to encircle the city from multiple directions,"" the senior defense official said. The official noted that Putin’s troops have not made significant advances in encroaching on the city. However, they warned that just because Russia is advancing at a pace slower than originally believed ""doesn't mean that they aren't making any progress."" Heavy shelling has hit cities like Chernihiv and Kharkiv, located in the north of Ukraine, and over 480 Russian missiles have been levied throughout the country – hitting Ukrainian military points, government buildings and residential areas. Ukrainian soldiers are seen near the recently collapsed bridge which was the target of a Russian missile, near the town of Irpin, Ukraine on March 3, 2022. It remains unconfirmed how many deaths have been caused by the invasion, but the United Nations said that during the first five days of fighting 227 Ukrainian civilians were killed and 525 injured. Casualty numbers remain conflicted, however. Ukraine's State Emergency Service on Wednesday claimed that at least 2,000 Ukrainians had been killed, while the foreign ministry alleged that more than 5,800 Russian soldiers have perished. Moscow alleged that roughly 500 Russian troops had died so far, along with 2,870 Ukrainian soldiers and ""nationalists."" But it is not just the northern regions of Ukraine that are taking a beating. The city of Kherson, a Black Sea port that sits roughly 75 miles north of occupied Crimea, was reportedly invaded by Russian troops Wednesday, according to the city's Mayor Igor Kolykhayev. Roughly 300 people are believed to have been killed during the invasion and Kolykhayev said many of the bodies were rendered unrecognizable due to Russia's high-powered weapons. The U.S. senior defense official on Thursday said the U.S. could not ""independently"" confirm whether Russian forces had officially taken the city but noted that Russian troops in the south have not met the same ""challenges"" as those in the north. ""They launched these offenses in the south out of Crimea, where they have been occupying for eight years,"" the official said, noting that Russia already had built up infrastructure and a force presence in the region.

""One of our tasks is to convey the truth to the citizens of Russia that Putin unleashed a war and attacked all of Ukraine,"" said Oleksii Shaldenko, a college professor and the head of the Wantent firm. Shaldenko is conducting operations for his country's defense while holed up in a gritty bomb shelter with a laptop and spotty internet service, sleeping on a pallet and sharing the space with his dog and his mother. Oleksii Shaldenko is hunkered down in a bomb shelter with a laptop and spotty internet service, conducting cyber operations to help defend Ukraine. He told Fox News Digital that the name of the website, 200rf, is a reference to the 2007 Russian horror film ""Cargo 200."" : ""This is one of the most heartbreaking Russian films,"" he said. The film’s title itself is a reference to soldiers killed in action and evokes a certain symbolism in Russia, according to Shaldenko. ""Two hundred means death and all the horrors of war,"" he added. It runs counter to Russian propaganda, which is not even characterizing the invasion of Ukraine as a war at all, he said. Volunteers mix up Molotov cocktails in Kyiv as Russian forces stall north of the city. ‘,' ""The authorities and the media call it a ‘military operation’ and claim that the action is taking place in the ',’"" he said, using an acronym for small separatist regions on Ukraine’s eastern border with Russia. But Ukrainian cyber operatives are countering that narrative by providing evidence of the Russian presence across their country. Putin’s troops entered Ukraine last week from three directions – the north through Belarus, at the border near the city of Kharkiv and from the south through Russian-occupied Crimea. A 40-mile-long column of military vehicles has stalled north of Kyiv amid fierce resistance from Ukraine’s defense forces. : , Ukrainians attend an open military training for civilians range as part of the ""Don't panic! Get ready!"" in Kyiv amid the threat of Russian invasion. The battle in Kharkiv has raged for days with increasing reports of Russian artillery shelling civilian targets. Another battle was raging in the Ukrainian port city Mariupol. Violence had not yet reached Odesa, although sources there said the air raid sirens had begun blaring, and explosions and gunfire could be heard off in the distance Wednesday. The exact number of combat deaths in the war’s first week is unclear. Russian authorities on Wednesday reported almost 500 soldiers killed in action. Ukrainian officials said their defense forces had killed more than 10 times that. Independent verification was not immediately available. A 'S Ukraine's cyber defenders are behind a massive digital effort to counter Russian propaganda on other fronts as well. And they're working to share crucial information to the country's citizens, ranging from practical guides on how to act in emergencies to how to mix up a Molotov cocktail. Shaldenko's students are even involved. Hackers inside and outside of the country are also conducting cyberattacks and spreading their own information that they hope will turn public opinion against Putin on the other side of the border. ""We distribute anti-war messages via emails, text messages, chats and a feedback system,"" Shaldenko said. ""Our main task is to make the Russians understand that they can stop the Putin regime."" Scenes from a Kyiv bomb shelter. The invasion so far, he said, has been ""terrifying."" He said he spent the first four days underground. And when he ventured upward after that, he took a photo of an explosion through his window.

Peter Zwack talks with Harris Faulkner about the difficulties Russian troops will face as the war on Ukraine intensifies. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine entered its eighth day Thursday, as troops continued their assault on cities and the death toll on both sides mounted. Russia on Wednesday reported its military casualties, saying nearly 500 of its troops had been killed and nearly 1,600 wounded – though figures could possibly be much higher. Russia's Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu at a joint news conference at the Russian embassy in Washington after their meeting with U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel, August 9, 2013. Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu said that Russia will continue its ""special military operation"" in Ukraine until ""set goals are achieved."" : Speaking at a gathering of Russia’s military chiefs in Moscow Tuesday, Shoigu insisted the purpose of the ""special military operation"" was to ""protect the Russian Federation from the military threat posed by Western countries."" He accused the West of orchestrating Ukrainian resistance against Russia and maintained that Russian troops will take necessary precautions to not harm civilians. Destroyed buildings are seen on March 03, 2022, in Irpin, Ukraine. ""I emphasize that strikes are carried out only on military facilities and exclusively with high-precision weapons,"" he said, despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary. , Originally from the Tuva region of Russia, Shoigu arrived in Moscow around the time of the breakup of the Soviet Union, becoming the minister of emergency situations. During the 1990s and 2000s, he gained a reputation for visiting the sites of natural disasters and terrorist bombings and talking one-on-one with civilians, which gained him national popularity, according to Foreign Affairs. Russian President Vladimir Putin, left, and Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu during a visit a shipyard in St. Petersburg, Russia, Tuesday, April 23, 2019. Shoigu holds the distinction of being one of the few people in the Russian government who has held a senior position since the collapse of the Soviet Union, Dmitry Gorenburg, Ph.D., a Russian military expert told Fox News. ""If you look at who was in minister roles in 1999 and are still around now, there are only two names: one is Shoigu, the other is Putin,"" Gorenburg said. Despite having no military background or combat experience, Putin chose Shoigu to be the minister of defense in 2012. 'T ‘A ’ , At the time, Russia's military was undergoing a transformation in its fighting capabilities. Despite a swift victory in the 2008 Russo-Georgian War, military planners realized improvements were badly needed if they were ever to face a more formidable opponent like the U.S. or . ""From the tactical standpoint, that was a failure. The command and control was a disaster. They couldn't strike mobile targets,"" Russian-born former U.S. intelligence officer Rebekah Koffler told Fox News. ""And so on Putin's orders, the military was going to be transformed and modernized both from the standpoint of weaponry, training, and in terms of doctrine."" In this photo released by the Russian Defense Ministry Press Service, Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu shows his signature under a roadmap for military cooperation between Russia and China during a video call with Chinese Defense Minister Wei Fenghe in Moscow, Russia, Tuesday, Nov. 23, 2021. Shoigu replaced Anatoly Serdyukov, a man who also had no military background and, according to Gorenburg, ruffled feathers within the military ranks for not respecting their traditional way of doing things. - : ‘’ ' Shoigu, meanwhile, was seen as a man with a great organizational ability who would respect military traditions yet embrace innovation. Being ethnically Tuvan, he also had little chance of ever being accepted as president in Russia. ""The means that he is not threatening to Putin personally, or his other senior lieutenant … That's always the thing that autocrats fear,"" Gorenburg noted. ""He's been quite effective. And he knew how to play the generals to make them feel like he understood them and respected their traditions and so forth while he could still press ahead."" In the week leading up to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Shoigu oversaw military drills in western Belarus, Reuters reported. He was pictured with his Belarusian counterpart and other military officials at the Brest military facility in western Belarus. The U.S. Treasury Department last week included Shoigu and General of the Army Valery Gerasimov in its latest round of sanctions, saying that they were both ""directly responsible for the further invasion of Ukraine.""",7,4.229215475116491,4.214566258136004,0.014649216980487267,14

With Putin's invasion of Ukraine being ‘the most monumental thing’ that has happened in Europe since the end of World War , Fox News host Bill Hemmer and Bill Whittle dive into the various military machines the Russians are using to attack Ukraine and how the country rebuilt its military force after the fall of the Soviet Union. ""It was an open secret that Vladimir Putin had plans to go into Ukraine. The deployment happened in real-time right before our eyes. We watched his soldiers move south. We saw his tanks massing at the border, and then on cue, they rolled, flew, and sailed uninvited into a sovereign nation,"" said Hemmer. After the Soviet Union collapsed, so did now-Russia's military. ""The entire Soviet arsenal was just left to rust-- just left to rust. Their submarines are rusting on the docks. Army's underprepared, underfed, underarmed,"" said Whittle. Tanks move during the Union Courage-2022 Russia-Belarus military drills at the Obuz-Lesnovsky training ground in Belarus. Whittle explained that after the Soviet Union fell, it took Russia ""three decades"" to build back its ""war machine"" which resulted in a ""leaner and meaner"" military force. ""So now the Russian Army and Russian forces are in a situation where they're much smaller than they were during the Cold War, and they're also considerably more advanced technologically,"" explained Whittle. Hemmer went on to discuss how the Ukrainians are, in some ways, a generation behind in regard to military equipment. ""The Ukrainians are fighting the Soviet Union's equipment against modern-day Russia, and there's a considerable gap between these two,"" added Whittle, emphasizing the discrepancy between the two country's military forces. ""When Putin decided to move his restored force in the position, he called in the Armored Personnel Carrier, known as the . The was born during the Cold War when the U.S. and the Soviets needed to move troops into battle under heavy fire,"" said Whittle. Whittle discussed how infantry no longer ""walk"" into battles.

In addition to the army, Ukrainian civilians have taken up arms in the midst of Russian military aggression that has so far proved difficult for Moscow to confront while still struggling to achieve air dominance.

Currently, a Russian convoy 40 miles along is making its way toward Kyiv and Moscow has stepped up airstrikes as it targets large population centers like Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city located in the northeast. Part of Russia's doctrine, Spencer said, was to unleash large amounts of firepower in an effort to create a psychological impact and protect its forces. As the slow convoy moves closer to the capital, more attacks should be expected as Russia attempts to ""soften"" enemy targets and further isolate the city. ""You can clearly see their plan is to isolate all the eastern Ukraine armies on the east and to further isolate the capital,"" Spencer said. ""That 40-mile convoy's sole purpose is to isolate and penetrate the capital."" If Russia surrounds the city, it could cut off Ukrainian fighters inside, forcing them to hold out for extended periods without reinforcements and supplies from the West as they battle block-by-block, Spencer said. However, an assault on a city versus an open area requires several times more troops than in any other environment, Spencer said. He noted it usually takes five attackers for every defender, citing U.S. Army doctrine. Because of the terrain, cities are also good for strengthening defense plans. Despite being outgunned, the Ukrainians can be effective in dense, urban terrain if they use their firepower and surveillance in smart ways, he said. ""The amount of combat power and forces you need to do an operation like this, Russia doesn't have it in its army if the Ukrainians defend right,"" Spencer said. Since the invasion began, videos and news reports have shown Russian forces attacked, their equipment destroyed and some soldiers taken prisoner. The convoy headed to Kyiv is most likely tasked with taking the capital in what could be a large-scale assault, Spencer said. In a Twitter thread that went viral over the weekend, he gave a crash course to civilian resistors on a number of tactics to defend themselves, including building obstacles and barriers in the streets and fighting in places where they can take cover instead of exposing themselves in open areas, something urban terrain offer in abundance. Part of Ukraine's success is their determination but also because of Russia's failures, he said. ""The Russians made so many bad decisions,"" he said.

Fox News correspondent Benjamin Hall warned Tuesday on ""The Ingraham Angle"" that Russian President Vladimir Putin ""will bring out the heavy artillery and hit the people"" if backed into a corner, noting that it's a ""playbook of his."" : The sun is rising today on the seventh day of this invasion, and frankly, there is a lot of fear about what it might bring, and that's because yesterday we saw Vladimir Putin increasing his bombardments on urban areas, on residential areas. And he has warned, his Defense Ministry has warned that that will continue today. Yesterday, we saw Putin's forces take out a well-known landmark — the television tower in Kyiv — and there is growing fear now that he's going to pull back and continue this crushing bombardment of built-up areas. They also rained down rockets yesterday on the second-biggest city of Kharkiv, while Russia's Defense Ministry urged residents of both cities to flee today, saying it was going to strike unspecified areas within the city and hit their communications. However, when it comes to that 40 mile–long armored convoy that we have been talking about, the one that had been bearing down on Kyiv, it has actually made no advances over the last 24 hours. And the U.S. official now saying, in fact, that it has been beset by logistical problems, supply issues — short on fuel and food. And there is growing talk that actually this is not going the way that Putin hoped it would, and that is why he is doubling down. That is why he is using his heavy artillery. That's why he's using his rockets. The death toll, it keeps rising, and so does the exodus. The is now saying that 677,000 people have left in the past six days. That number rising by about 100,000 a day at the moment. Again, no one knows what today will bring, but Vladimir Putin in his Defense Ministry, making it very clear they are going to continue hitting these cities. … What is most likely to enrage Vladimir Putin is a sense that this is not going how he wanted, and if he finds himself backed into a corner, he's going to do what we've seen him do over the last day or two, and that is bring out the heavy artillery and hit the people.

Congress needs to expedite approval and delivery of a new significant package of military aid to Ukraine. We are both employees of or advisors to the Global Special Operations Force Foundation, the professional association for special operations, and we understand that we can’t wait until the middle of March for the United States to send aid. Congress has an opportunity to quickly craft a proposal to send to the president this week. Time is of the essence. The battle for freedom and democracy in Ukraine is happening now and at a critical stage. This is the most consequential war since World War because the outcome will shape international security structures for the next century, especially in Europe and Central Asia. : '' ' ' , The conflict in Ukraine is a campaign that can’t be funded piecemeal. The required military material for Ukraine will exceed the $2.9 billion that is proposed in the $6.5 billion request from President Biden. Congress must approve $16.2 billion to cover the required military and humanitarian aid. President Joe Biden delivers his State of the Union address to a joint session of Congress at the Capitol, Tuesday, March 1, 2022. Combat operations are coming to a critical inflection point whereby both sides need to replenish supplies to the fighting forces and sustain the civilian populace. The question for both sides is who will run out of supplies logistically first, thus providing either the attacker or defender a substantial, if not decisive, advantage. The most urgent needs are to resupply the Ukrainians to defend themselves against unrestricted Russian aggression. The Ukrainian Armed Forces and populace are fighting effectively in many places but are outnumbered and often outgunned. The Russians have superior mobility and firepower but lack the essential local knowledge and the will to fight this fight. Once major cities are surrounded, and the eastern half of the Dnipro is secured, it will become attrition warfare after that. It is a matter of time before Kyiv runs out of ammunition, water, food, power, and civil necessities to keep society functioning. Firefighters work to contain a fire in buildings housing the Kharkiv regional security service and the regional police, allegedly hit by Russian shelling in Kharkiv on March 2, 2022. The United States has the capabilities to provide decisive aid to Ukrainian resistance forces. Ukrainian armed forces and defenders need to have the power, material, and capabilities to deny Russian resupply ground and air routes. They need the capabilities to break Russian encirclement perimeters. They need the resources to sustain the population’s basic needs during the length of the conflict while preparing for Russian occupation. Finally, they need to have the aid to expel Russian invasion forces from Ukraine’s territory. Without immediate support, the Ukrainian resistance will be doomed. There is a long list of general combat, armed forces, and supporting territorial needs, including ammunition for small arms, crew-serviced, and vehicle-mounted weapons of which the Ukrainian resistance has a need. The resistance needs tank and artillery ammunition of various calibers. They also need anti-tank munitions such as the Javelin missile and launchers with spare batteries, the -4, , and Karl Gustav weapon system. An aid package should help them secure night vision devices to include individual night vision goggles and aiming devices, and night vision and thermal/infrared sights for crew-served weapons. Finally, they need Stinger anti-aircraft systems, hand-held communications, small tactical drones, individual protective equipment, field rations, and field medical kits. All of these are immediate military needs that should be sent as quickly as possible to the resistance in Ukraine through reliable supply routes. A view of damaged regional police station after a Russian missile attack in Kharkiv, Ukraine, on March 2, 2022. There is another bucket of aid in the form of support for the command and leadership in Ukraine. They need secure, long-range communications base stations and associated antennas. There needs to be aid to reconstitute the Ukrainian psychological operations facilities destroyed by Russian missile strikes. Remote portable s, radios, and an alternative secure internet communications system that do not have to rely on land-based communications that transit through Russia are needed. Finally, there needs to be an information and broadcast center that can reach into Russia to counter the Kremlin’s disinformation. An aid package should designate funds for humanitarian support for Ukraine, Poland and Romania to deal with the humanitarian crisis. Emergency communications, pioneer equipment, hand tools, sensors, urban rescue supplies, temporary shelter materials, use of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance warehouse supplies, and Internally Displaced Persons camp sets and kits will help the victims of this aggression. Resistance forces need aid to be armed and trained with lethal munitions, weapons, secure communications, supporting equipment, secure basing, infrastructure, basic life support for developing, training to support Ukrainian resistance forces. Clothing, equipment, weapons, and ammunition for training and employment should also be a part of the lethal aid provided that should also provide secure communications and transportation capabilities. Congress is working on a supplemental that could be added to the 22 appropriations package. That plan should be comprehensive and specific. The problem with this plan is that it will not be signed until March 11, 2022, at the earliest. That is too late. Without immediate support, the Ukrainian resistance will be doomed. Congress and our federal government need to move at the speed of war if we wish to see democracy protected in Ukraine.

Every aircraft has weather limitations, and a pilot's visibility can be impacted by how thick the cloud deck is. Snow is a problem if it's falling to the point where visibility becomes an issue. Most pilots prefer a 500-foot buffer above the ground and below the clouds at a minimum, though those preferences are more lenient during wartime, said Darling. ""If you're looking at air-to-air combat, and you have a weather system coming through … your airspace in which you can maneuver is a little bit less if you're trying to attack another aircraft,"" Darling added. With poor visibility of fewer than two miles and ceilings below 1,000 feet Russian fixed-wing attack aircraft will have a very hard time avoiding terrain, identifying targets, and ensuring no friendly fire during attack runs, Clemente said. Fixed-wing attack aircraft, like the Russian Sukhoi Su-25 jet, or Russian Mil Mi-24, typically provide fire support in close proximity to friendly forces. They require close coordination between ground elements and attacking aircraft. , A benefit for the Ukrainians is that the Russians are attacking them in their backyard. San Clemente argued that the Ukrainian forces are familiar with not only the terrain but also with what they can and can't get away with when the weather gets bad. A Sukhoi Su-35 multi-role fighter jet performs during a demonstration flight at the 2017 air show in Zhukovsky, outside Moscow, Russia, July 21, 2017. The defender has an advantage because they’ve typically laid out a field of fire, while the attacker is searching for targets. The snow could also make the terrain look uniform and as a result, make it harder for the Russians to see people who aren't moving, the retired general added. ""As the defender tends to know the terrain and friendly disposition better than the attacker – the defender has the advantage,"" said San Clemente. ""This same rule applies for attack helicopters, but the weather can be worse. To some degree, it depends on crew proficiency and terrain awareness systems on the aircraft."" Many of Ukraine's surface-to-air missiles are radar-guided and not impacted by the weather, which also makes it difficult on the Russians, he added. The weather was also a double-edged sword, Clemente said, as it makes it difficult for Ukrainians trying to provide close air support. If Russian rotary-wing aircraft need to get close to identify targets due to poor visibility or low ceilings, San Clemente said the aircraft becomes susceptible to Ukrainian defenders' s , which are mainly guided by infrared. An example of an system is the U.S. stinger missile. The number-one way that an attacking aircraft defeats a missile being shot at it is visual acquisition, San Clemente said. He noted that the aircraft's system can warn the pilot, but without the pilot acquiring the missile itself, it can be difficult to avoid. Both sides are well-versed in winter aerial warfare, but the heat-seeker is an advantage for the Ukrainians, which will be able to better target Russian aircraft in the cold, retired U.S. Marine Corps -46E helicopter pilot Pete Phillips told Fox News. A Ukrainian Sukhoi Su-27 fighter jet. Fighter jets don't get impacted as easily once they're in the air. The MiG-29 Fulcrum, which both sides fly, has intakes on the top that resemble shark gills, which are ""designed to keep the engines from sucking snow in during takeoff,"" Phillips said. , Other aircraft at higher altitudes don't have to worry about the terrain, but they are visible to radar s and counter-air aircraft. The Russians also need someone on the ground to provide detailed coordinates for targets. ""Further, they must have -guided weapons to achieve any hope of accuracy,"" San Clemente told Fox News. ""The defender may also employ jamming and other electronic defensive measures to mitigate the accuracy of enemy air attack. This does not, of course, preclude the attacker from bombing with less than desired discrimination."" Rep. August Pfluger, R-Texas, who flew F-22 fighter jets during his 20 years in the Air Force, warned that civilian casualties in Ukraine could increase due to bad weather. ""Their willingness to strike civilians and to have indiscriminate bombings or strikes throughout the first couple days of the conflict will only be magnified by bad weather and I will expect civilian casualties to increase,"" he said. Pfluger noted that if the Russian forces were not operating together, bad weather will severely impact them. Two U.S. F-22 Raptor fighters fly over European airspace during a flight to Britain from Mihail Kogalniceanu air base in Romania. ""I think what we're seeing right now is a real lack of integration between the land forces and Russian air forces,"" Pfluger told Fox News. ""It seems like they still do not have the full operational capability to integrate targets in effect between land and air components which you see in our military and ."" Russians have their own brand of guided weapons, just like the U.S., so they won't be impacted very much when targeting a fixed location. San Clemente noted that bad weather won't impact their ability to put weapons on fixed targets.",49,5.128553107738878,5.13064707294021,-0.002093965201331649,22

Jack Keane shares his military outlook on warfare in Eastern Europe. A sole protester stood outside the complex known as the Russian Diplomatic Compound in New York City’s Riverdale neighborhood on Thursday, hours after a long-anticipated war began across the world in Ukraine. The compound, a white high-rise tower located at 355 West 255th Street, sits at one of the highest points in New York City and has often been the subject of speculation surrounding the building's purpose and residents' practices. The building is home to Russian diplomats, many of whom work in the United States as intelligence officers – or intelligence ""operatives,"" as the Russians call them – and seek information or connections that the federation might need, multiple experts told Fox News Digital. ""They view us as threat number one. And sooner or later, they believe that information will be useful, whether it's for wartime or peacetime."" : Most Russian intelligence officers – those who work for the Foreign Intelligence Service or the federation's military intelligence agency, known as the – live in the building, which is known to some law enforcement officers as the ""plex,"" said Robin Dreeke, a retired special agent and former head of the bureau’s Counterintelligence Behavioral Analysis Program. But some senior-level Russian intelligence officers and select others are allowed to rent homes in the Riverdale area itself, Dreeke said. And the existence of the intelligence officers living among New Yorkers is common knowledge to some, he added. Woman stands outside Russian Diplomatic Compound on West 255th Street in Riverdale, on Thursday, Feb. 24, 2022 Police vehicles parked outside Russian Diplomatic Compound on West 255th Street in Riverdale, on Thursday, Feb. 24, 2022 ""Open secret is a good way to put it,"" Dreeke said, when asked. ""I think they think it’s more of a secret than we do."" When asked on whom or what these intelligence officers might be spying, Dreeke said, ""everything."" ""A lot of people think that spies are just going for the high-level classified military infrastructure kind of stuff,"" Dreeke continued. While that is true, ""the real purpose of spying/intelligence collection is filling information gaps that another country has, and mostly to provide their policymakers and decision-makers the knowledge they need that's not common knowledge that they can get through legitimate means."" Dreeke has first-hand experience with the compound, as he spent hours outside the building during his time with the New York’s Russian Military Intelligence Squad from 1997 to 2005. To put it simply, his unit tried to recruit Russian spies and then neutralize them to protect American interests, national security and allies. : He remained involved with numerous operations related to officers throughout his career. He later founded a company, People Formula, and has since authored several books.

Russian Foreign Intelligence Service Director Sergei Naryshkin is seen while opening of the exhibition on violations of human rights in Ukraine , on January 18, 2022 in Moscow, Russia. There are two types of intelligence officers, Dreeke said: those who pose a symmetrical threat, and those who pose an asymmetrical threat. Those working in New York and living at the ""plex"" and working at the mission to the United Nations are under ""diplomatic cover."" ""It’s what we called a ‘symmetrical threat.’ We know they’re here. They’re diplomats under diplomatic cover, so they actually have all the privileges of diplomats. So, when they’re caught conducting espionage against our country, you can’t throw them in jail, because they’re diplomats,"" Dreeke continued. He added: ""No one likes it. But it’s a fact of life."" But they’re different from the undercover operatives who are not under official cover and are in the United States. Those who pose an ""asymmetrical threat,"" undercover operatives such as Jack Barsky, who operate under non-official cover, under ""false pretenses, with fake names."" Barsky grew up in East Germany and was later recruited by the now-defunct , Russia’s security agency, before it ultimately became the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation . According to a biography on his website, he lived a double life in America for 10 years – during which time he worked as a spy for the Soviet Union. Barsky left the job and was later arrested by the . He is now an American citizen who has become a prominent author and public speaker. Only diplomats live in the Russian compound in Riverdale, meaning any Russian intelligence officer who has asymmetrical intentions would not. Similar compounds are located anywhere in the country where there is a Russian consulate, Dreeke said. A , There are Russian diplomats living inside the complex who are not intelligence officers, he went on. ""And then you have others that, they do the diplomatic job probably one or two hours a day. And the rest of the day is spent collecting intelligence"" to fill information gaps and then sending that information to the Russian government in Moscow, he said. Rebekah Koffler, a Russian-born former intelligence officer for the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency, called the process of having intelligence officers stationed in parts of the world ""a standard procedure."" ""The United States also has intelligence officers posted all over the world,"" she said. As for the Russian compound in Riverdale, the Russian intelligence officers who live there ""don’t necessarily spy on that community. They spy in general – they spy on the United States."" Koffler and Dreeke noted the diligence with which Russian intelligence officers do their research, which they then use to form their policies and operations. ""They do their homework,"" Koffler said. ""That's the one thing that is very different from the way that we do things. We're just not nearly as diligent."" Koffler, author of ""Putin’s Playbook,"" added that Russian intelligence officers ""do their homework for years,"" regardless of whether the information is pertinent to current events. ""They collect regardless – the Russians and the Chinese do – Because that's just how they do business,"" Koffler went on. ""They view us as threat number one. And sooner or later, they believe that information will be useful, whether it's for wartime or peacetime, when they want to undermine and somehow cause some kind of disruption."" '' , ',' Russian intelligence officers who are in the United States under diplomatic cover are not necessarily interested in the people who live in the neighborhood. They will try to make friendships and become close with people whom the Russian government deems potentially useful, such as government officials or their friends – ""somebody from whom they can collect information,"" Koffler explained. The Grand Kremlin palace, left, and the Cathedral of the Annunciation in Moscow, Russia, on Tuesday, Feb. 15, 2022. ""It’s not like they try to steal your wallet or your purse and get your information that way,"" she said. ""It’s called targeteering – they identify, ‘, we need a list, we need somebody in your State Department,’ or, ‘We need somebody at the United Nations’ … and they do their homework and they study"" their target, Koffler further said. She went on: ""Where does this or that person hang out? Do they play golf, for example? Once they identify who exactly they need, what kind of access, they figure out that person's patterns of behavior … they would show up, like, on a tennis court if you are playing tennis. And they would strike a conversation with you and try to be your friend. And you have no idea that you've been targeted because it all looks so innocuous and accidental."" Dreeke said Russian intelligence officers are looking to get to classified or proprietary information as well as those individuals who are in the position to know about it. The information they’re seeking can depend on the ""flavor of the day."" During his time investigating Russian operatives and goals, Chechnya was among the topics of importance for the federation, Dreeke said. ""They wanted to know what different organizations were due to support or defend Chechnya,"" he said. ""Cancer research, believe it or not, was a huge one … They were also tracking shipping – of all kinds of things, they’re tracking things like [meals ready-to-eat] … because that might tell you where the U.S. forces are building up or not building up."" Based on his experience, Dreeke estimated that 95% to 98% of the information that intelligence officers are collecting is ""benign,"" while the remaining 5% to 2% is classified – ""it is proprietary that does that greater damage."" A view of the Russian Diplomatic Compound at 355 West 255th Street Located on tree-lined West 255th Street and Mosholu Avenue, the building is 20 stories high, and features 15 residential units per floor, according to The Riverdale Press. ""The Russians constructed it on top of the hill so they could actually have good radio receiving and transmissions from that point,"" Dreeke said. ""They strategically bought on that property, so they could actually monitor the radio traffic, as well."" ""Comrade J: The Untold Secrets of Russia’s Master Spy in America after the End of the Cold War,"" a book written by Pete Earley, describes the compound as having a flat roof under which there were ""dozens of antennas designed to match signals and conversations from New York City’s airwaves."" Dreeke noted that while he was not heavily involved with the technology, the antennas were known to be used for sending and receiving coded messages, as well as for collecting information. ""If they can collect it, they collect it,"" he said. ""[The] Russians are great at sucking in every bit of information they can because their analytical machine back in Moscow is really, really good."" He added: ""The antennas are used for transmitting and the antennas are used for collecting. And whatever the flavor of the day is, that’s what they’ll suck in.""",20,5.073642759890478,5.310459859974057,-0.23681710008357904,27

'S 40 'S : ""The [blast] kill mechanism against living targets is unique--and unpleasant...."" reads a 1993 U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency study. ""What kills is the pressure wave, and more importantly, the subsequent rarefaction [vacuum], which ruptures the lungs....

""It was an emotional decision for us, but we decided to go back home,"" Tsymbalistyi told Fox News Digital on his wife’s choice to stay with him in Ukraine. After a tearful discussion, Petro and his wife brought their kids to a safe location with family and returned to Lviv to actively support the resistance against Russia. ""I want to describe it, how united we are as a country right now. I think we're so united because everyone is doing what they can."" : Rather than picking up an assault rifle to target enemy troops, Tsymbalistyi has taken his fight to the arena he knows best – the web. ""It’s a hybrid war,"" Tsymbalistyi said. ""I have a team, and we’re doing oS attacks,"" he continued. oS stands for distributed denial-of-service – a type of internet-based attack that overwhelms servers with traffic to knock them down. Tsymbalistyi recruited employees from his tech company Integer as well as some of their international clients to form a team of 12 and join up with the thousands of hackers who make up Ukraine's volunteer army. In addition to disabling Russian government websites, Petro's team also uses oS attacks to take out ""Russian bots,"" social media accounts he believes are spreading disinformation on behalf of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s agenda, that are on popular platforms like Telegram and Twitter. Besides diluting Russia’s digital messaging, the team has also found opportunities to penetrate Putin’s notoriously ironclad hold on the dissemination of information within his own borders by finding new ways to tell what Petro and his collaborators believe to be ""the truth"" – the story of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Tsymbalistyi and his team post photos and descriptions of blasts and skirmishes that have happened over the last week in comments on popular YouTube videos and in reviews for heavily frequented Russian venues. In doing so, they have found a creative way to bypass the Kremlin and inform Russian citizens about the conflict. Petro's wife Mariia Tsymbalistyi hiding underground with their young son while Russia attacks Ukraine. The White House announced earlier this month that U.S. intelligence received information that Russian leader Vladimir Putin planned to use fake information to justify an invasion of Ukraine – which he launched last week. Russian propaganda efforts have blamed the invasion on Ukraine, claiming a military intervention there would stop an alleged ""genocide"" in ethnically Russian provinces, of which there is no evidence. , : According to Graham Shellenberger, Director of the Global Team at Miburo Solutions, a strategic analysis and consulting company specializing in the countering of foreign malign influence worldwide, these types of efforts to present conflicting information to sectors of the population that Putin has targeted with messaging have been extremely effective against the Russian president. ""Ukraine is winning the information war hands down,"" Shellenberger told Fox News Digital. According to the propaganda expert, who also spent years as a psychological operations officer in the U.S. Army, the Russian style of messaging under Putin has typically aimed to ""splinter"" countries like Ukraine, as well as western powers. But this time, it looks like his maneuvers make have backfired. Putin ""has brought the European Union closer together. He's brought closer together. He's brought Ukraine closer together,"" Shellenberger said. Although disinformation sourced back to Russia can be found targeting populations around the globe, Shellenberger says it still primarily aims to limit freedom of the press and access to information within Russia to ensure that little can challenge the government’s prevailing line. President Joe Biden and Russian President Vladimir Putin, arrive to meet at the 'Villa la Grange', in Geneva, Switzerland, June 16, 2021. ""Most of Russia's propaganda and disinformation about Ukraine for the last eight years, but certainly in the last couple of months, is focused on the Russian domestic population. That is their number one target,"" Shellenberger said. Shellenberger notes that one of Ukraine’s most successful uses of communication has been in shaping its own narrative within the country as well as beyond its borders, even if only a small percentage of it makes it to Russia. Selfie videos of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy preparing for battle, as well as unverified stories and videos that perpetuate a certain ""mythos"" around Ukraine’s resilience as an outnumbered military, have largely contributed to the determination of everyday people to coalesce around the goal of defeating Russia, according to Shellenberger. While the Kremlin still has a firm grip on Russia itself, Shellenberger says time is Putin’s biggest enemy in the information war, and Ukraine’s continued will to hold out and fight is bad news for the former agent. ""The longer this goes, the harder it will be for Putin to control what's going on, Shellenberger said. ""It's easier to tell people it's fine until the body bags start coming home.""",20,4.218117871384532,3.8410074988990615,0.3771103724854705,17

""The level of the threat to global security has been equated to that of the Second World War, or even higher, following Putin’s order to put an alert to Russian nuclear forces – what a madness,"" he added.

Kharkiv came under intense rocket fire Monday as Ukrainian and Russian officials met for peace talks near Ukraine’s border with Belarus. Those talks ended Monday without a deal being reached. Ukraine officials said dozens of civilians were killed and hundreds more injured in the Kharkiv attack after Russian forces bombed residential areas and apartment complexes. Vladimir Dubinin, a Ukrainian man hiding in a bomb shelter in Kharkiv, phoned into Fox News’ ""America’s Newsroom"" on Monday following the bombing attack.

Russian President Vladimir Putin addresses an extended meeting of the Russian Defense Ministry Board in Moscow on Dec. 21, 2021. Russia hoped to quickly take Kharkiv, a predominantly Russian-speaking city just miles from the Russian border, but Ukrainian fighters put up a massive fight and regained control by late Sunday. The fighting is expected to continue there as Russia slowly advances on the capital city of Kyiv, located about 480 miles west of Kharkiv. Comparisons to and Hitler have been a common theme since Putin invaded Ukraine five days ago. When the attacks started Wednesday, air raid sirens rang out in Kyiv and multiple other cities for the first time since . Many journalists compared photos of Ukrainians hunkering down in underground metro stations to those taken of Londoners during The Blitz – Hitler’s eight-month bombing campaign against the U.K. The Blitz ended up being a strategic failure for Nazi Germany, costing blood and treasure while achieving no military objectives. World leaders hope the same will be the case for Russia after meeting tougher-than-expected resistance in Ukraine. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba made a Nazi Germany comparison on Thursday after Russia’s first attacks on Kyiv. ""Horrific Russian rocket strikes on Kyiv,"" Kuleba tweeted. ""Last time our capital experienced anything like this was in 1941 when it was attacked by Nazi Germany. Ukraine defeated that evil and will defeat this one. Stop Putin. Isolate Russia.

Putin, he believes, erroneously assumed that Ukraine would surrender the moment troops crossed the border and that President Volodymyr Zelenskyy would flee. Zelenskyy, instead, has defiantly remained in the city with government leaders and ministers, vowing to fight the incursion with his people, and supplying weapons to anyone willing to fight. Putin thought he could pull off victory with special operations that would target Kyiv and Zelenskyy. ""He was going for a decapitation of the Ukrainian leadership,"" Shaffer said.

""Even if we have no other information, we know this is not good for Russia,"" he said, calling the Kremlin’s military might ""exaggerated."" He said that Putin is in a tough position because he really can’t use heavy, indiscriminate bombardment without losing domestic support and further taunting the West. ""There is a cost to a scorched earth type of warfare,"" he said. ""There are limitations."" If Putin secures victory, which Keane, described as inevitable, it will be a pyrrhic one, the general said.

Jack Keane discusses Russia's invasion of Ukraine and Putin's potential weaknesses on 'One Nation.' Russian President Vladimir Putin had a long career as an intelligence officer in the former Soviet Union’s – the former Communist spy agency – and likely took great efforts to plan his invasion of Ukraine before sending thousands of troops into the country earlier this week. But American and British intelligence analysts say Russia appears to have underestimated Ukraine’s defensive capabilities – at least initially. Russia’s stalled advance could be because of faulty or ignored intelligence, according to Dan Hoffman, a former senior officer and station chief. But it’s impossible for anyone outside the Kremlin to know for sure, he added. Russian President Vladimir Putin had a long career as an intelligence officer in the former Soviet Union’s – the former Communist spy agency – and likely took great efforts to plan his invasion of Ukraine before sending thousands of troops into the country earlier this week. : ""Is Russia surprised by all this? Yes,"" he told Fox News Digital Saturday. ""Therefore, they didn't do a great job in collecting the intelligence that they needed. And that's pretty humiliating, because Ukraine's on their border and they were occupying pieces of it."" Putin invaded Ukraine’s Crimea region in 2014 and has been backing separatists in two other eastern regions of the country, an area collective known as Donbas, and he said he would recognize them as independent republics in the days before the all-out invasion of Ukraine. ""Why did Vladimir Putin do this?"" he asked. ""He should have known these things – but didn’t."" Ukrainian servicemen are seen next to a destroyed armoured vehicle, which they said belongs to the Russian army, outside Kharkiv, Ukraine February 24, 2022. - ; ‘I , , ’ Hoffman had predicted back in 2019 that Putin’s long-term objective ""is the destruction of Ukraine as a state."" ""Putin doesn’t want a successful democracy next door serving as a beacon of hope and inspiration for his own domestic opponents, who are denied basic civil liberties,"" he wrote at the time, along with Sir Nicholas Soames, a former United Kingdom defense minister. And Putin could have been planning that destruction for as long as two decades, he said. Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine earlier this week, with Putin claiming the move was a defensive measure amid threats from Ukraine. The White House warned earlier this month that U.S. intelligence had predicted the invasion on fabricated grounds. Surveillance footage shows a missile hitting a residential building in Kyiv, Ukraine, February 26, 2022, in this still image taken from a video.

Capt. Jimmy Byrn says he believes Zelenskyy's example will 'go down in history.' President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is winning the social media war. When he appears by the dawn’s early light from Kyiv, the world knows Vladimir Putin hasn't taken down Ukraine yet. Russia's attack on Ukraine is the first major military confrontation of the social media age. The gut reactions brought to you by social media are a whole new factor impacting the war strategy of both Ukraine and Russia. Hint: Ukraine’s doing much better. 'S While armies have used information warfare for ages, the world has never seen this many videos and pictures of a war zone up close and coming at you so fast. On Twitter, @ee85 posted a TikTok of a Russian Mi-24 attack helicopter engaging a Ukrainian self-propelled air defense missile battery on a highway near Kyiv, and then @hengenahm added the geolocation coordinates. Granted, it’s hard to form an overall assessment of the campaign from the thousands of battle clips. There’s so much information it’s impossible to digest or verify it all. But the videos of destroyed equipment tell a tale. You see Ukraine fighting back. You see that Russia’s savage attack is not moving as fast as Putin hoped. The Pentagon said Saturday resistance is greater than the Russians expected. Social media images of destroyed Russian equipment make you believe that's true. But there’s much, much more to the social media story. You've got posts from three groups: the Russian invaders, Ukraine's defenders and the bystanders. The bystanders are by far the biggest group. Their posts are a huge amorphous collection of war images culled from TikTok and other uploads and curated to Twitter and other sites where journalists and analysts take note. Let's not be naïve. Obviously, the bystander posts include a mix of items from concerned citizens and propagandists for both sides. Social media gives the advantage to Ukraine, and rightly so. But here’s what’s amazing: the effect is powerful for Ukraine, not Russia. Smoke, fire, destruction, tearful soldiers, and suffering fuel the world's outrage at Putin’s unprovoked invasion. Social media gives the advantage to Ukraine, and rightly so. Next consider the masterful images from Ukraine’s officials. Kyiv Mayor Vitaliy Klitsckho, former heavyweight champion, checks in on Instagram. Foreign Minister @DmytroKuleba posts damage photos on Twitter. Top of the lot is Zelenskyy. Remember Zelenskyy was a successful comedian and actor before he was elected president of Ukraine in 2019. In his hit show he played a history teacher elected president of Ukraine because people were fed up with the establishment. Then he ran for president for real. Before that, Zelensky did stand-up mocking Russian tourists in Crimea. You can see why Putin hates him. Zelenskyy knows how to work the camera and his audience. Video clips of him from Kyiv are swaying the world to his side. A week ago, Ukraine seemed far, far away. Now millions around the world are personally invested in the safety of Zelenskyy and the citizens of Ukraine. That brings us to social media Player Number 3, the Russians. Hopeless. Russia’s early social media plan was to push out video of its military equipment massing at the border, all shot and released by the Russian defense ministry. I’ve never seen so much up-close footage of nasty Russian S-400 air defenses and tanks and trucks with their invasion markings. However, Russia’s pre-war media blitz failed to intimidate Ukraine or into concessions. Now madman Putin’s heavy-handed Soviet-style propaganda about Nazis in Ukraine is backfiring again. Putin’s been in power for 20 years, way before the iPhone era. Maybe no one told the 69-year-old autocrat that world events now get real on Instagram. Did he not realize the world would resent seeing Russian forces kill and destroy for no reason? The strategic value of social media is real. Military analysts have known that open-source intelligence – nicknamed – would soon be right up there with satellite photos as another insight on the bad guys. But few predicted the big advantage social media would give to Ukraine’s defenders. What’s harder to judge is whether social media posts are having much impact on the diplomat crowd and the implementation of sanctions. Of course, Twitter won’t stop tanks. Social media can't protect Ukraine and its people against Russian firepower. But if Ukraine holds out, historians may soon say social media helped buy Zelenskyy the time and support needed to deny Putin the win.",7,3.7251576701731377,4.041064196842938,-0.31590652666980024,17

2022-02-23,Fox,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/russia-ukraine-new-cold-war,"What's next from Russia, Ukraine and the new Cold War?","Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Texas, discusses the White House response to Russia-Ukraine tensions. ""This is the beginning of a Russian invasion of Ukraine,"" President Biden said on Tuesday in response to Russian President Vladimir Putin's recognition of Ukraine’s two breakaway regions. Putin’s decision was quickly followed by the movement of thousands of Russian troops to the region to enforce that land grab, a sobering reminder of the emergent new world order. Moscow’s invasion of eastern Ukraine is déjà vu 2008 with the Republic of Georgia [seizure of Abkhazia and South Ossetia] and Ukraine in 2014 [annexation of Crimea], and if I were in the Baltics [Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania] and the balance of Ukraine, or perhaps even Poland, I’d watch carefully movements to my east. Putin is poised to push west against the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to recover lost ground which he considers part of the historic Russian Empire. , Putin’s aggression should alarm westerners who naively cling to ’s prowess. Years ago, during the Cold War , the West was much stronger and more able to stand up against Soviet aggression but not so much now. I doubt anyone who truly understands ’s capabilities believes the alliance can really defeat the Russian army. The numbers just aren’t there anymore. Meanwhile, Putin long ago planned to create the pretext to move against Ukraine’s east via misinformation about alleged atrocities. That’s been building now for weeks: hybrid warfare with psychological operations, cyberattacks, and cease-fire violations. Recently the evacuation of civilians into Russia was a clear indication Putin’s plan was falling into place. Those actions remind me of Germany in 1939 and Poland. What now? Putin didn’t need 190,000 troops and a phalanx of tanks, thousands of artillery pieces, and a shipment of plasma to declare the eastern Ukrainian region independent. No, there is much more and this was long ago planned. Looking into the future, expect Russia to keep large numbers of troops in Belarus, and many thousands inside eastern Ukraine. Also, recall that Putin and Belarus’s President Alexander Lukashenko declared the formation of a reaction force, a key indicator that Russia will hold its ground. Further, expect the geopolitical temperature to rise, subject in part to and the West’s response, if any. Will the Germans really kill Nord Stream 2, the pipeline from Russia? Will Biden really pull the rug on Moscow’s access to [Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications]? Don’t be too optimistic. After all, Italy is already waffling on Russian sanctions. Did Biden secretly agree in advance to allow Putin to do this? Or are we to believe this is a coincidence? The pragmatic Germans won’t let their economy suffer from a lack of energy, even though Biden said the Nord Stream 2 will ""not move forward."" Alternatively, former President Trump offered to sell U.S. natural gas to the and Germany as a counter to Russia. That should be revived. The White House has already started walking back from the sanctions, commenting that Russia is only formalizing in the East what everyone has already known. After all, this might be the ""minor incursion"" that Biden basically allowed Putin in a January 2022 speech. Question is, did Biden secretly agree in advance to allow Putin to do this? Or are we to believe this is a coincidence? Meanwhile, assuming Putin’s latest land grab holds, then in time – perhaps next winter – the Kremlin’s authoritarian will continue to whittle away at the fringes of Eastern Europe, the countries of the former Warsaw Pact. Expect Moldova to be next; after all, Moscow already has troops in that tiny country. Further, the Ukraine kerfuffle will energize communist China’s President Xi Jinping to launch his campaign against Taiwan, which might not happen immediately but looks more certain thanks to Putin’s growing encroachment into Europe. President Biden’s promised harsh sanctions won’t slow Putin, much less the slap on the hand he announced following Tuesday’s invasion. After all, these actions are already calculated into the mix, and besides, expect China to launder much of what the Russians really need to continue operations, such as purchasing any excess oil and gas that the West may sanction. Further, and this is important, read the February 4, 2022 joint communique released by thugs Putin and Xi at the launch of the 2022 Beijing Olympics. They are now more joined at the hip than ever before. And yes, we are in a new Cold War. erhaps this new Cold War isn’t exactly like the one that ended with the demise of the former Soviet Union in 1991. However, it is real and just as threatening. My 2018 book, ""Alliance of Evil,"" is now proving to be absolutely correct in that China and Russia are fulfilling their intent, and that comes at the expense of freedom seeking people across the world. What are America’s interests in the current Ukraine-related crisis? There are at least four interests. First, as a member, we are obligated under Article 5 to come to the aid if an alliance member is attacked. That could happen. Second, Putin seeks to replace Europe’s current security infrastructure that grants Moscow more oversight. Already we’ve seen the French and German leadership caving on that front. Third, Americans will experience not just higher energy prices but security costs will escalate due to our demonstrated weakness and skepticism about our staying power. Finally, sovereign nations across the world will make decisions where they stand based on their view of both Russia and China, the world’s rising power. President Biden’s term in office set the stage for these radical changes and could act as an accelerant to something far worse on the horizon. . .",4,4.128317538215804,2.9404167128042786,1.1879008254115258,2

If an all-out war breaks out between Russia and Ukraine, as Russian forces cross the border between the two countries, Ukraine's ability to fight back will depend in large part on the quality of its military equipment, much of which comes from the U.S. The U.S. has supplied Ukraine with Javelin anti-tank missiles, rifles and night vision equipment. And Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba told Fox News' ""Special Report"" that the U.S. has agreed to send more defensive weapons to his country. This raises the question: Who has better military technology, the U.S. or Russia? The answer is not as clear-cut as it may have been in recent decades, as Russia has poured funding into its military development. 'S , : ‘A ’ ""This isn’t the old Soviet military,"" former Marine and current Heritage Foundation senior research fellow Dakota Wood told Fox News. A tank drives along a street after Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered the deployment of Russian troops to two breakaway regions in eastern Ukraine following the recognition of their independence, in the separatist-controlled city of Donetsk, Ukraine, Feb. 22, 2022. Wood said that Russia's invasion of Georgia in 2008 revealed its weaknesses and was a ""major lesson"" for the Kremlin. As a result, he said, ""Russians have put a lot of money into modernizing their forces"" while reducing the size of its army. Retired Gen. Jack Keane said the U.S. is ""overall superior to Russia in military capability on the ground, in the air and at sea."" ""However in last two decades, Russia has worked on improving their military systems and have a number of excellent capabilities – which the U.S. has, as well,"" Keane added. Russian improvements have come in air defense systems, fighter/bomber aircraft, offensive/hypersonic missiles, armor/mechanized brigades, rocket/long range artillery, quiet-running submarines and modernized nuclear weapons, Keane said. Additionally, Russian forces have gained ""a lot of real-world experience"" in recent years, Wood said, pointing to Syria and the Donbas region of Ukraine. Between this and keeping up with modern technological advances, Russia has a much more formidable fighting force than in the past. ""It would be a mistake to underestimate the capability of the current Russian military,"" Wood said. , 'S ‘’T ' Russian media has bragged that the country has night vision technology that is even better than what the U.S. military has. Wood said he does not know if that is necessarily true, but said Russia's night vision is ""probably at least as good"" as what the U.S. has. In fact, he said, when it comes to long-range land weapons, Russia's capabilities are superior to the U.S.'s. The American artillery system that has been in use since 2015 has a maximum range of 30 kilometers. This is 10 kilometers less than Russia's, and 23 kilometers less than China's, according to data compiled by the Heritage Foundation. American equipment, Wood said, remains good but has not seen the sort of funding that the Russians have provided for its forces. Wood also noted that American military equipment has not had to go up against a major state military in quite some time, as much of its recent conflicts have been against terror organizations and insurgent groups. Russia is something quite different, he noted. ""It's not fighting the Taliban,"" Wood said. One advantage that Russia does have is geography, according to Keane, given that the U.S. is an ocean removed from a potential battlefield.

'S , Deputy National Security Adviser Jon Finer, during an interview on Tuesday morning, was pressed on whether Russia’s latest activities would be considered an invasion. ""We think this is, yes, the beginning of an invasion, Russia’s latest invasion into Ukraine, and you're already seeing the beginning of our response that we have said will be swift and severe,"" Finer said. A tank drives along a street after Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered the deployment of Russian troops to two breakaway regions in eastern Ukraine following the recognition of their independence, in the separatist-controlled city of Donetsk, Ukraine February 22, 2022. When pressed again, Finer said: ""I hear an invasion as an invasion and that is what is underway."" But Finer noted that Russia has been ""invading Ukraine since 2014"" and have been occupying a ""large piece"" of Ukraine since then as well. ""Although they have denied it, Russian troop presence in exactly the two—what they call republics, but they’re really provinces of a sovereign Ukraine—that they recognized yesterday,"" Finer said, referring to Putin’s recognition of the independence of Donetsk and Luhansk. ""So, Russia is essentially making overt what it has denied for some time, which is Russian troop presence in these places, and we’re taking steps in response to that,"" Finer said. Pressed further, Finer again called the activities an invasion. -: 2 ""I mean, again, I guess for the third or fourth time, I am calling it an invasion,"" he said. ""We are taking a severe response, including sanctions on Russia that will be rolling out in a matter of hours."" As for sanctions, Finer told that the public is ""already seeing the beginning of our response that we have said will be swift and severe."" Finer pointed to President Biden’s executive order on Monday, which he said effectively blocked ""all economic activity"" in Donetsk and Luhansk. Russia's President Vladimir Putin signs decrees to recognize independence of the Donetsk and Lugansk People's Republics. Finer said administration officials later Tuesday would announce ""additional sanction steps"" that they plan to take ""that go directly at Russia"" in response to ""the egregious step that they took yesterday away from diplomacy and down the further path toward war."" White House press secretary Jen Psaki on Tuesday morning said President Biden has ""made clear that if Russia invaded Ukraine, we would act with Germany to ensure Nord Stream 2 does not move forward."" Germany overnight said it is taking steps to halt the process of certifying the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline from Russia over Moscow’s latest actions in eastern Ukraine. ""We have been in close consultations with Germany overnight and welcome their announcement,"" Psaki added. ""We will be following up with our own measures today."" The 764-mile pipeline that would carry natural gas from Russia to Germany has not begun operating. Nord Stream 2 is owned and operated by a wholly owned subsidiary of Russia state company Gazprom. Pipes for the Nord Stream 2 Baltic Sea gas pipeline are stored on the premises of the port of Mukran near Sassnitz, Germany, on Dec. 4, 2020. Earlier this month, Biden promised to ""bring an end"" to Nord Stream 2 if Russia invaded Ukraine. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, appearing with Biden on his first official visit to Washington, was far less explicit about stopping Nord Stream 2, but said that the U.S. and Germany would have the same approach on punishing Russia financially. The Nord Stream 2 has seen a faster development and deployment despite sanctions placed on it by the Trump administration. With those sanctions removed, Germany remains keen to see the pipeline activated sooner rather than later. Scholz had insisted that the pipeline is a ""business project,"" according to German outlet . Biden last year removed sanctions on the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, allowing construction and activation to proceed. The plan to allow Russia to develop the pipeline to create leverage in times of political crisis may have backfired, as Germany has also rapidly grown dependent on the completion and activation of the pipeline. Meanwhile, senior administration officials told reporters on Monday evening that they will ""continue to pursue diplomacy until the tanks roll."" ""We're under no illusions about what is likely to come next,"" one official said. ""And we are prepared to respond decisively when it does.""

Russia’s ""minor incursion"" of peacekeeping forces into Ukraine is President Biden’s last chance at world leadership. War is underway, with Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg saying Russia continues ""to plan for full-scale invasion."" Time for Biden to shift into battle mode. Biden can seize the initiative first by unleashing the massive sanctions he’s been boasting about for weeks. ' ' The longer Biden waits, the greater the risks that Putin will move more military forces on the rest of Ukraine. Putin wants the world to shrug it off. Russian war games stoked the scheme. Since Russia’s not bombing Kyiv as the White House, Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Mark Milley and others kept describing in lurid detail, the false sense of relief will slacken world response. So far, that’s working. China called for restraint. Europe is in a dither over whether it’s a real invasion or not. has not even activated the Response Force it built up after the 2014 Russian annexation of Crimea. Just like Biden disastrously predicted back on Jan. 15. 'S , Time for the U.S. to step up. Biden should kick Russia out of the banking system, target the personal bank accounts of Putin and his friends, and stop the NordStream 2 pipeline. Biden has another unique and major task. He’s got to get the U.S. military ready to help when Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy asks. It’s time for bright red lines. Diplomacy is done. Put Secretary of State Antony Blinken and crew on the bench and never mind the U.N. The China-Russia ""Dragonbear"" have the Security Council on ice so the U.N. won’t help Ukraine. Looks like Biden is incapable of doing this alone. So Biden should urge the U.S. Senate to pass its ""mother of all sanctions"" bill. Biden should stand with British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and any other strong allies, like Australia, and condemn Russia and back up words with deeds.

2022-02-21,Fox,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/russia-ukraine-crisis-lloyd-austin-bidens-defense-secretary-rebecca-grant,Russia-Ukraine crisis: Lloyd Austin's top tasks as Biden's defense secretary,"Fox News foreign correspondent Trey Yingst reports the latest on the conflict from Ukraine. Russian President Vladimir Putin is baiting Ukraine with artillery shelling, cyber attacks, mysterious explosions in Eastern Ukraine and nuclear missile drills featuring bombers and hypersonic missiles. With President Biden’s economic deterrence against Russia teetering, keep your eyes on Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin. Russia is ""uncoiling those forces and poised to strike,"" Austin said in Lithuania on Saturday. If Russia attacks, Biden will look to Austin to confirm it and recommend America’s next military move. Austin, a retired Army four-star general, is by law the man who gives the president’s orders to the military. He’s the direct chain of command from Biden to U.S. and forces in Europe . 'S All the crazy tactics from Putin’s playbook are no surprise to Austin. Austin played it cool on his visit to Europe. He’s not about to be rattled by Russia’s attempts at provocation but he’s watching Putin like a hawk. ""We see some of those troops inch closer to that border,"" Austin said of Russian forces on Thursday. ""We see them fly in more combat and support aircraft, we see them sharpen their readiness in the Black Sea. We even see them stocking up their blood supplies."" But Austin is aware of Putin’s darker intent. ""I was a soldier myself not that long ago,"" Austin said from Brussels. ""I know first-hand you don’t do these sorts of things for no reason."" The U.S. military is still the glue for the international system. With the world watching, here are the six things Austin must continue to do. Bolster . Austin says he’s never seen more united or resolute. In part, that’s because Austin is giving members frequent tactical updates on where the 150,000 Russian forces are, and if they are in attack position or not. Speaking in Lithuania Saturday, Austin said he’s ready to send American forces if chief Jens Stoltenberg activates the response force. Keep Ukraine Calm and Confident. That ""situational awareness,"" as the military likes to say, is vital for Ukraine, too. Kyiv can downplay the Russian artillery firing on the ceasefire line in part because the overwatch assures Ukraine that Russians aren’t crossing into Ukraine at the same moment. Sharing this tactical information, some of which is very sensitive, is part of Austin’s job and it’s a crucial ingredient for President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s day-to-day decisions. Stay Vigilant. Austin’s got this. Combat surveillance aircraft from the U.S. and are saturating the skies from Helsinki to Istanbul right now. It’s a 1,300-mile air curtain with planes to listen for Russian tactical radio signals and monitor the 150,000 forces deployed by Putin. Austin has to keep ‘em flying, as he did by sending extra F-35 stealth fighters from Utah to Germany on Wednesday and adding select ground forces at eastern bases. Fight the Info War. In this first big war crisis of the social media age, information is everything. A splash of U.S. intelligence can unmask Putin’s plans. Austin must keep choosing the right intelligence to drop publicly from the White House, State Department, the Pentagon, etc. Each reveal of a Russian battle plan or ""false flag"" sabotage scheme peels away Putin’s options. Make the Tough Calls on Russian provocations. The U.S. and Britain expect Russia will manufacture a crisis. It may be artillery shelling, cyber attacks, terrorist bombs, and fake or real chemical weapons events. If an incident flares up, Austin will be the one to weigh in on whether it’s a brief situation that Ukraine should ride out, or step one of an invasion. Look to America’s Defenses. Since it’s war started by Russia we’re discussing here, the prudent move is to fortify military cyber defenses, monitor American space assets on orbit, adjust force protection levels for our service members, and keep an eye out for Russian mischief directed at Americans abroad and at home. Austin’s probably done it already. There is still time to avert war, according to Austin. Hopefully Putin will cave and de-escalate. If he does, it will be Austin who verifies that yes, Russian forces are moving back in a significant way. ""We will match Russian words to Russian deeds,"" Austin said Thursday.",4,3.3443434543297212,3.19849750980773,0.1458459445219913,5

This slow march toward - or away from - war is being played out so publicly that armchair quarterbacks are already keeping score of who is winning and who is losing. And it's an information war. Some say a propaganda war. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken has warned that Russia could create a pretext for attacking Ukraine by fabricating a terrorist attack on Russian soil or that Russia could stage a fake – or even a real – chemical weapons attack. ""We are laying it out in great detail with the hope that by sharing what we know with the world,"" he said at the United Nations yesterday. ""We can influence Russia to abandon the path of war and choose a different path. While there's still time.

He has his own show on Russia’s Channel 1 and discusses these topics at length with policymakers and other people. Asked whether Russians really believe that or Ukraine is about to attack Russia, Pozner appears to acknowledge that is viewed as a defensive organization, but points to post-Cold War military missions has partaken in around the world as evidence that the term ""defensive organization"" is seen differently in this part of the world. : ""I think the sense of threat comes from a long time from what the Russians consider a lie to mislead in the promises about 's not being enlarged, not moving eastward. The feeling that actually should have been disbanded because it was created to thwart or stand up to the Soviet threat and there was no more Soviet Union and there was no more threat."" Pozner partnered with talk show host Phil Donahue on U.S.-Soviet Space Bridges programs broadcast in the waning years of the Cold War to try to open minds on each side – and then the Berlin Wall fell.

""There were two possibilities: When the United States had to make a decision about this new country called Russia, which had not existed before because it was a Soviet Union, and it could have adopted a kind of Marshall Plan to really help the country move forward in a democratic way,"" Pozner argued. ""And there were others who said they've threatened us for 40 years and they should pay for it. They lost the Cold War and they should pay for it. And ultimately, that's the viewpoint that that was adopted in the end."" Pozner remains hopeful that Russia and America may work past this - one way or another - and become allies. ""Well, I've always had that hope precisely because of my background, maybe in that sense, I'm very romantic or idealistic, but I would answer that question with a yes, although I don't have much to stand on when I say that,"" Pozner says. There is a sense among some that Russian President Vladimir Putin's stance towards the West may be built on resentment for having been kept out of ""the club"" as and the European Union expanded, but that club may not have been big enough for two major powers.

That might explain why the world leaders who hastened to Moscow in recent days for diplomatic talks seemed to balk at Russian-administered coronavirus tests. But this may be a case where imagination is getting a bit ahead of what science is actually capable of. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz refused to let Russia conduct a test — while French officials said President Emmanuel Macron balked at some of the requirements to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin, leading to speculation he didn’t want the Russian swab either. Neither leader is known for opposition to -19 countermeasures, so speculation arose that they were trying to keep genetic material out of Russia’s hands.

A French official said Russia's conditions for Macron to get close to Putin were ""not acceptable"" and ""not compatible"" with the French president’s agenda. Hence: the absurdly long marble table that Macron and Scholz shared with the Russian president and which spawned many memes. German government spokesperson Steffen Hebestreit said he was ""reluctant"" to comment after the Macron stir. But he told reporters in Berlin that Scholz followed the same procedure Germany applies to foreign dignitaries: They can submit their own tests and, if there’s any doubt, a doctor can come on board the plane to observe the testing. ""The Russian side saw it differently and said: if there’s a test it needs to be a Russian one.

2022-02-16,Fox,https://www.foxnews.com/world/russia-ukraine-crisis-what-to-know-putin,Russia-Ukraine crisis: What to know about Putin's latest moves,"Russian President Vladimir Putin's ultimate motives unclear The crisis over Ukraine might be taking a new, but no less dangerous turn. While there are some signs of cautious hope in recent days, the Russian threat remains very real. ""There’s a feeling that it’s still a case of ‘bluff brinkmanship’ to the ‘nth degree,’"" Bohdan Nahaylo, the editor-in-chief of the Kyiv Post, told Fox News. Just this week, Russian President Vladimir Putin said his country was ""open to more diplomacy"" and ""ready to hold dialogue."" ""The message we seem to be getting from Russia is that they’re ready to give diplomacy another chance,"" Mykhailo Wynnyckj, the author of ""Ukraine’s Maidan, Russia’s War,"" noted to Fox. At the same time, Putin’s defense chief claimed some Russian troops were pulling back from some positions along the border with Ukraine. chief Jens Stoltenberg said the alliance was seeing ""no signs of deescalation."" Nahaylo added, ""It could be ‘smoke and mirrors.’"" The facts on the ground are broadly unchanged in the last few weeks of this crisis. Russia has some 130,000 troops close to the borders with Ukraine, including in western Russia, in Crimea to the south — which it claimed as its own — and in ally Belarus to the north. Russia's typical claim: These troops are simply conducting drills. But the numbers and the nature of the combat hardware they've carried with them spoke to something much more serious. The demands from Russia remained broadly the same as well. While the U.S. and West have been trying to humor Russia with offers of limits on missiles in Europe and greater transparency in military exercises there, Moscow’s core issues have only just begun to be touched upon: that Ukraine and other ex-Soviet states never join and that the U.S.-led alliance pulls back troops and activities on its eastern ""flank"" near Russia. For its part, the Biden administration has been trying to stay on the same tough ""page"" with the Putin regime. ""I think the U.S. was slow to take into account the full severity of what was happening,"" Nahaylo remarked, ""but recovered its position and took a leading role in rallying the West."" Ukrainian civilian military training outside Kyiv in January 2022. The sanctions package readied against Russia by the U.S. with its allies has teeth. While direct military help for Ukraine in the event of an invasion has been ruled out, military aid to Kyiv has been ramped up and confidence-building troop deployments to countries nearby are underway. U.S. Clearly still feeling the fallout from the chaotic evacuation of Kabul following the Taliban take-over in Afghanistan last summer, the U.S. has led the way in emptying out its embassy in Kyiv — a move some analysts warned was too aggressive. ""I think embassies have overreacted, including the American embassy for having closed,"" Wynnyckyj said, ""at the end of the day, not helpful."" At the very least, there have been messaging conflicts between Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and the U.S. and West. For weeks, he’s complained about ""premature"" diplomatic departures as well as overzealous predictions of a possible Russian invasion. ""The population is caught between mixed signals, as it were,"" Nahaylo said. ""They’re happy for the help but confused by the messages they’re receiving."" The Zelenskyy government seemed to let go of its tough upper lip this week, calling for a ""Day of Unity"" on Wednesday, one of the days chosen by the West for a possible Russian incursion – a date that seems to be slipping. So, what is next for the Ukraine crisis? Experts said the upcoming days and weeks could be critical. : - ""The next two or three weeks will show what diplomacy will produce,"" according to Nahaylo, ""and whether Ukraine will keep its ranks closed."" Experts are still not ruling out a full-scale invasion by Russia, a major attack on Ukraine’s infrastructure, or a swiping away of more territory in the Russia-leaning east and south. What others have feared is a hybrid war, like the cyber-attack seen Tuesday on several Ukraine websites. Or, some of the ""false-flag"" attacks to stir up the population and create trouble from within. ""We are looking at some sort of infiltration,"" said Wynnyckyj. ""Not in the classic invasion sense, but causing kinetic-style diversions."" The wild card in all of this, of course, is Putin. No one claims to know what is going on in his mind, or whether his final decision will be rational. According to Nahaylo, ""We regard him as a chess player, as a strategist, as a tactician … but he could be crazy."" With all the disruption he’s already caused and all the attention he’s already garnered, maybe ""crazy like a fox.""",4,2.637828142300847,2.189718211668871,0.448109930631976,3

""If Russia proceeds we will rally the world who opposes its aggression. The United States and our allies and partners around the world are ready to impose powerful sanctions on export controls. … We will put intense pressure on their largest and most significant financial institutions and key industries.""",4,3.4751550075331186,2.8399030049808984,0.6352520025522201,2
2022-02-14,Fox,https://www.foxnews.com/world/russia-ukraine-troop-buildup-intentions-reporters-notebook,Reporter's Notebook: Russia's intentions emerge with Ukraine troop buildup,"Dmitry Suslov, deputy director of the Center for Comprehensive European and International Studies at University, says Russian President Vladimir Putin is trying to ""create tension"" by positioning troops at the Ukrainian border. Many in the West have opined that Russian President Vladimir Putin likely must be doing ""something"" of significance. After all, he didn't mass all those troops on Ukraine's borders for a little exercise. Or even a big exercise. But according to Russian foreign policy insider Dmitry Suslov, Russia's moves are going according to plan. ""The whole reason behind the concentration of troops by Russia at the Ukrainian border is to create tension, to accompany the Russian political demands with the demonstration of military force, which has already brought some significant positive results to Russia,"" Suslov, who is deputy director of the Center for Comprehensive European and International Studies at University, told Fox News. ""From the Russian perspective, and this is the predominant opinion really widespread in Moscow, without the concentration of the Russian troops, without belligerent rhetoric, without speculation about the ‘military-technical’ response by Russia, Russian security guarantee demands would have gone directly to the dustbins everywhere in the West."" Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow on Feb. 1. Suslov explained that Russia considered escalation a ""tool of diplomacy,"" so Ukraine shouldn't count on seeing the back of its tanks until Moscow's demands are met. Those demands, well-known to many by now, are a pledge that Ukraine will not join and that an East European buffer zone of some sort between the alliance and Russia is configured. Also key: that Donbas, comprising those eastern Ukrainian regions now controlled by Russian-backed separatists, is given a significant degree of autonomy as spelled out by the as-yet unfulfilled Minsk agreements. ""The implementation of the Minsk agreements would both deliver the kind of Ukraine which Russia wants: a decentralized Ukraine, a Ukraine which, by definition, cannot be consolidated on an anti-Russian basis, or on the basis of Ukrainian ethnic nationalism, as it is today with Ukrainian language, Ukrainian nationalist ideology and so on and so forth, being the basis of their national identity."" Suslov continued, adding that Russia didn't want Ukraine to be ""a Western fortress at the edge of the Russian border."" A Ukrainian marine border guard after a patrol in the Sea of Azov, waters near Mariupol, Donetsk region, in eastern Ukraine, on Feb. 2. But, to Ukrainians aspiring to a future hitched to Europe, Russia's wants haven't been their concern. They've worried about losing more territory to Russia after what happened to Crimea in 2014. The West has stood by their rights to choose the security alliances or arrangements they wanted, and their self-determination. ‘ ’ Suslov claimed a full invasion of Ukraine would not serve Russia's interests. Instead, he said it would ""result in enormous costs – economic, social, political, foreign policy, military. It will not be kind of a parade. It will be a very difficult military operation, followed by a guerrilla war, because there will be insurgency from different places in Ukraine and so on and so forth. And I don't think that anyone in the world would among the great powers, including China, would explicitly support Russia in such an endeavor."" Pentagon Press Secretary John Kirby says 'good sources' and intel point to a Russian invasion 'in plain sight.' Suslov added, ""Russia, I think, will continue to look as if it is preparing for invasion unless the Russian demands are addressed."" I asked Suslov if the crippling energy costs hurting Europe were part of this pressure campaign. He said no; he saw Europe's problems as a result of the coronavirus pandemic and the slower-than-expected transition to green energy on the continent. But, he added, Russia certainly was not running to the rescue by voluntarily opening the taps. ""It is weird for the European Union to be surprised with this Russian refusal because Russia would have certainly increased its volumes of supplies to the European Union if we were friends, if the relations were based on partnership. But come on, we perceive each other as adversaries. So, you expect a friendly behavior from the party, which the European Union has made its adversary against, which the European Union has adopted sanctions and continues to promise new and new sanctions? This is bizarre.""",4,2.2593824342472577,2.563236644753751,-0.3038542105064934,14

A war reporter living in Ukraine for the past eight years is calling the mood in the nation similar to one in Florida before a hurricane as the world waits on edge to see if Russian forces will end up invading. Nolan Peterson, a U.S. veteran, joined ""Fox & Friends Weekend"" to discuss what life is like on the ground as tensions between Vladimir Putin and the rest of the world continue to mount. ""It's hard to really find the words to describe what it's like to walk around a European capital and to see, you know, kids in playgrounds and couples holding hands, life going on and to think that this could all be prologue to some horrible tragedy just around the corner,"" Peterson told co-host Pete Hegseth. ""During the past, I've used the analogy of a Florida town before a hurricane to kind of describe the mood here… as people try to decide what they should do, should they leave or stay or, in this case, take up arms and fight,"" he continued. Peterson said it is ""incredible to watch"" the nation prepare for a Russian attack, saying it's now ""game time."" -: 1 , ‘ ’ He cited the willingness of civilians nationwide to learn basic military skills and how to survive in a war zone. ""The Ukrainians are fighting for their freedom, their democracy, their existential right to exist as a free country, free from Russian oppression,"" Peterson stated. ""And these people, the civilians, the everyday men and women are willing to stick their lives in that future."" The State Department over the weekend warned any U.S. citizens that remain in Ukraine should leave immediately and seek departure through Poland, while the U.S. military also announced another 3,000 troops would deploy to Eastern Europe. ""As an American, as a veteran, just like yourself who fought for our country's freedom, it is really inspiring, and it kind of cuts to my heart to see these people believe in the things that we believe in so strongly,"" Peterson stated. President Biden held a call with Putin over the weekend, warning him the Kremlin would endure ""swift and severe costs"" if it proceeds with an invasion.

2022-02-11,Fox,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/biden-russian-invasion-ukraine-putin,Why is Biden warning a Russian invasion of Ukraine is imminent? And what if Putin calls his bluff?,"Former deputy national security adviser McFarland and Fox News contributor Marc Thiessen weigh in on the rising tensions between Russia and Ukraine on 'The Story.' The Biden administration keeps yammering on about Russia invading Ukraine any minute, warning Russian troops could take Kyiv in three hours. It's right about Russian capabilities, but why is the administration screaming it from the rooftops? Does it think Europeans, especially Germany, will be spurred into action? Well, that ship sailed a year ago when President Joe Biden started shutting down the U.S. energy industry, while at the same time allowing Russian energy exports to expand. He threw away American energy independence. It drove up oil and gas prices, hurt the U.S. and European economies, and made Russia rich. ’ ‘’: . German Chancellor Olaf Scholz's position was pretty clear – to everyone except apparently Biden – when the two met at the White House this week. At their joint press conference, Biden announced: ""If Russia invades, that means tanks and troops crossing the border of Ukraine again, then there will be no longer a Nord Stream 2. We will bring an end to it."" Chancellor Scholz dodged questions on whether Germany would go along with Biden’s threats. Therein lies the problem – Germany, and other major European powers aren’t going to war, military or economic, over Ukraine. They can’t, because they don’t dare jeopardize their economies, which rely on Russian oil and natural gas to function. Biden claims canceling Nord Stream 2 before it goes operational will send a message to Russia, but not affect Europe’s current import flow. Putin can still punish Europe by causing supply shortages to the energy Europe already gets from existing pipelines. It could even be to Putin’s advantage – prices will go up, and he’ll get the same revenue for less product. If Germany does cancel Nord Stream 2, Putin’s got that covered, too. He’s lined up China as the new buyer. What if Biden's actions are actually goading Putin into crossing into Ukraine? So, the question remains, why does Team Biden insist on threatening massive sanctions if Russia invades? President Biden may have tipped his hand when he carefully defined an invasion as Russian forces crossing the border. Just a week or two ago, Biden implied a ""minor incursion"" might trigger a different response or not much of a response at all. He has made no mention at all on whether we would respond to hybrid warfare. Putin can do whatever he wants with Ukraine – everything from outright invasion to everything else that falls just below that threshold. What is important to him is to keep Ukraine out of , to drive a wedge between members, and ultimately to bring Ukraine back under Moscow’s control. I do not believe Putin wants to invade and occupy Ukraine. He can probably get what he wants with hybrid warfare – economic pressure, energy outages, cyberattacks, disinformation campaigns, false flag operations, and intimidation. These all fall under the threshold of a hot war, and give Putin deniability, even if nobody outside of Russia believes him. An actual invasion could get messy. If the Ukrainian military fights to defend itself, especially if there are significant civilian casualties, Russia risks looking like a bully on the world stage. If Ukrainians resort to guerilla attacks, or if the fighting is prolonged, Putin risks Russians coming home in body bags. Which brings me back to the original point: Why is Team Biden warning a large-scale invasion is imminent? Maybe because they’re setting the stage for the Biden version of the Cuban Missile Crisis. If Putin doesn’t invade – because he can get what he wants without doing so – Biden can claim this as a great victory. He would be the man who faced down Putin and got him to back away from all-out war. The problem is that President Biden has a tendency to miscalculate things – the rapid Taliban takeover and our shambolic withdrawal; supply chain shortages; an American public fed up with masks and mandates; persistent high inflation due in part to high energy prices Biden’s own policies caused. What if his actions are actually goading Putin into crossing into Ukraine? What if Putin calls Biden’s bluff? Don’t worry, Biden has a plan for that, too. Biden is sending additional U.S. troops to countries that border Ukraine. He’s not going to have another Kabul crisis. The Pentagon announced U.S. troops can help evacuate some 30,000 Americans in Ukraine. K.T.",4,3.005658893489219,3.4369559282418987,-0.43129703475267966,2

The U.S. Embassy in Ukraine announced Friday that the 14th flight of weapons had arrived in Kyiv, including more Javelin anti-tank missiles. Russia's top officer, Gen. Valery Gerasimov, has flown to Belarus to personally oversee the joint exercises with Russia’s ally. American Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, spoke to his counterpart in Belarus by phone Thursday to ""reduce chances of miscalculation,"" according to the Pentagon. He also spoke to his British and Ukrainian counterparts. Russian amphibious warships are now in the Black Sea. Ukraine's defense minister said Russia has now ""blocked"" waters offshore ahead of planned missile tests in the coming days. Many of Russia’s large warships in the Black Sea are loaded with naval infantry, tanks and other armored units. A former top commander of U.S. Army forces in Europe believes Russia is most likely to strike Ukraine from the sea. ""It will be a little bit below some perceived threshold where not every European country will be so thrilled about having to invoke sanctions ‘like you've never seen before’ because Russia took some islands or coastal area,"" said retired Lt. Gen. Ben Hodges, now the Pershing Chair at the Center for European Policy Analysis. ""What the Russians are doing is like a boa constrictor that is continuing to squeeze Ukraine,"" Hodges added. He does not expect the massive, full-scale invasion of Ukraine that many in Washington predict. ""I don't anticipate an all-out assault with these red arrows that we've been seeing pictures in newspapers, red arrows coming in from every direction simultaneously. I don't know that the Russians have the assets."" Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., a former Army infantry officer with combat deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan, disagrees. ""I think the invasion is much more likely than not. I very much respect Gen. Ben Hodges. It is true that southeastern Ukraine and Mariupol are very exposed, but it’s also true that the capital city Kyiv in central Ukraine is exposed to those military exercises in Belarus,"" Cotton said during a live interview on the Fox News Channel with Sandra Smith.

The U.S. Air Force also announced it was sending F-15 fighter jets to Poland to help bolster defenses one day after the White House approved plans for some of the 3,000 U.S. troops sent to Poland to help set up camps on the border to assist with a potential invasion of some 30,000 Americans in Ukraine, should Putin order an invasion. Since 1999, when expanded to include three former Warsaw Pact countries, Russia has seen the alliance expand closer to its borders. Russian President Vladimir Putin has said he feels threatened, pointing to the bombing of Serbia three weeks after Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic joined as proof the alliance is not always ""defensive"" as the West claims. Putin has also cited operations in Libya and Iraq as more examples of what he calls overreach. Since retiring as head of U.S. Army Europe, Hodges called the technological advancement of the Russian forces in recent years ""chilling."" ""The ability to develop their drones, to connect drones, to detecting targets on the ground either from intercept or through visual, and then have artillery or rockets hit that target so quickly, that is one of the most chilling capabilities to realize that they have that, and clearly that matured a lot while they were in Syria."" Russian forces first deployed to Syria in 2015. Since then, Russia has used the opportunity to showcase its vast array of new weapons, such as launching guided Caliber missiles from warships, the same way U.S. Navy destroyers have launched Tomahawk cruise missiles in recent decades. Before going to the Black Sea, the Russian warships stopped to resupply in the Syrian port city of Tartus on the Mediterranean coast. ""We look at Russia as a pure adversary [now],"" Hodges said. ""I am very impressed and concerned with the development of Russia's electronic warfare capability. You know, the last 20 years, we were focused correctly, on cellphones, and terrorist networks and in trying to intercept and crack into those,"" Hodges said. ""Meanwhile, Russia continued to develop high-end electronic warfare capability that enables them to intercept, but more importantly, jam at long distances – to jam communications, satellites, etc."" Members of Ukraine's Territorial Defense Forces, volunteer military units of the Armed Forces, train in a city park in Kyiv, Ukraine. ' ‘’: . The U.S. military depends on a constellation of satellites to guide precision bombs from its jets down to the target. These communications links are now in danger of being severed, Hodges said. Asked about Putin’s motivations for moving over 100,000 troops to Ukraine’s border and thousands more offshore in the Black Sea and Sea of Azov, Hodges said, ""I think he assumed that we would have already blinked by now, that we would have rolled over on some of the outrageous demands that the Kremlin made."" Asked how any potential Russian military operations would commence in Ukraine, Hodges said, ""They will be using cyber. They will be using sabotage. They will be using disinformation to create havoc and confuse us, but I just don't think they have the capability to capture Kyiv,"" the capital city. In addition to , there is something else that Putin fears the most, Hodges said. ""He sees the idea of a Ukraine that begins to look like Poland or Estonia in terms of freedom and prosperity on his border.

Cotton,"Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., gives his take on developing Russia-Ukraine tensions as military drills with Belarus begin. The expectation of Russia invading Ukraine is becoming progressively more likely based on recent military patterns, Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., analyzed on ""America Reports"" Thursday. According to Russian military movement and the commencement of drills with Belarus, Cotton anticipated that President Putin has every intention to attack the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv first, pending invasion.

Russian military vehicles are seen on a railway platform on their way to joint military drills in Belarus, in Russia, on Jan. 24, 2022. ""Those military drills… are nothing but a cover for a likely invasion,"" Cotton said. ""I think they tell us, since they’re starting so soon, that we could be down to a matter of days, not weeks."" Cotton advocated for not sending any troops into Ukraine as members of the U.S. military stand by at the Polish border. The senator did, however, share an explicit message for Americans still in Ukraine: Get out now. ""You should leave now,"" he asserted. ""If you do not leave now, you should make a plan to leave by ground to the west into countries like Poland or like Hungary."" Members of Ukraine's Territorial Defense Forces, volunteer military units, train in a city park in Kyiv, Ukraine, on Jan. 22, 2022. ""You should not expect that the American military is going to be able to fly aircraft into Ukraine and help you evacuate after a potential invasion,"" he went on. ""For the sake of safety, I would urge all Americans in Ukraine to leave today."" : The senator also responded to Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov’s expression of ""disappointment"" in diplomatic talks. Cotton boiled down the last few months of diplomacy as ""nothing but a ruse"" to prepare for Ukrainian invasion. ""Regrettably, because of failures of policy and weakness over the last year, as well as Vladimir Putin’s desires, I think the diplomatic route has reached its end."" President Vladimir Putin gestures while speaking to the media at the Kremlin in Moscow, Russia, on Feb. 1, 2022.

Don’t write off Kyiv, but if Vladimir Putin attacks ""any day"" under cover of wargames in Belarus starting this week, President Biden will have an instant decision to make. Ukraine does not want U.S. or ground forces. They’ve already lost 14,000 in the eastern region conflict with Russia and want to fight Russia themselves. However, Ukraine will need help, fast. U.S. commanders would receive word of a Russian attack in less than five minutes. - – 'S , ’s ready. Is Biden? Biden’s chaotic response to the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan still casts doubt on his skills as commander in chief, and the Obama-era legacy of letting Russia off lightly doesn’t help. There’s no question in my mind that Putin was emboldened by Biden’s Kabul failure to try a max-pressure strategy on Ukraine. Still, I liked it when Biden on Sunday snapped that ""Putin wants things he can’t get."" And his threat on Monday to stop the Nord Stream 2 pipeline backed up the ""economic deterrence"" his team prefers. Here are some of Biden’s choices. Provide location information on Russian forces. In modern war, soldiers fuse precision position data on the enemy and hand it off to forces authorized to shoot back. Ukraine can use anti-tank and other weapons when it has cuing or targeting data, and can help. Biden needs to be ready to react with military forces, because Putin is out on a limb. Brace for a cyber-attack, on the battlefield or across Ukraine. Ukraine may need more help if Putin tries to pull down the Zelenskyy government with disinformation, denial-of-service or cyber heists. ’s already helping Ukraine with cyber early-warning. Set up a no-fly zone over Ukraine and use airpower’s electronic warfare. A no-fly zone should keep Russian combat jets and bombers out of Ukraine’s airspace, so they can’t provide cover to invading forces. planes can also use electronic warfare to garble Russia’s tactical command and control, breaking links with Russian target-spotting drones, for example. It’s especially important if Russia fires heavy artillery over the border to shell Ukrainian forces, like in 2014. Neutralize Russian air defenses. Russia already had vicious mobile air defenses in Crimea and moved others to Belarus for exercises. But, as Putin knows, aircraft can employ high-speed anti-radiation missiles and other tactics to make Russia very reluctant to switch air defense radars on. Don’t forget U.S., British and French aircraft blew right past Russian air defenses in Syria when striking chemical weapons targets in 2018. Authorize Ukraine’s forces to call in U.S. and/or airstrikes on Russian tanks, artillery and other military assets. The U.S., Canada and others have trained selected Ukraine forces as air controllers who can call in airstrikes following strict rules of engagement. It’s a quick step to make a torrent of strike aircraft available. Russia likes to encircle cities then lob in artillery or airstrikes, as they did in Syria. That won’t work if Russia does not control the air. Prepare for refugees. The worst-case scenarios could drive refugees into members Poland, Slovakia, Hungary and Romania that border Ukraine. Caring for them would strain airlift and political attention. Biden needs to be ready to react with military forces, because Putin is out on a limb. According to their own doctrine, Russia doesn’t exactly want to invade, they’d prefer to scare Ukraine and enough to get Biden to cave on several demands. One analysis from 2019 found ""Russia uses big wargames and deployments to borders to intimidate. ... By demonstrating the ability to mass combat forces quickly along a border, these drills aim to instill fear and doubt among target populations and their governments."" And if that doesn’t work? Russia is well-placed for a quick strike, but knowing that the U.S. and could send rapid help to support Ukraine’s ground forces might make Putin think twice. Russia is using the build-up to coerce Ukraine and the West. Biden must make Putin realize the U.S. and are vigilant and ready to push back – that’s the clearest way to deter. Biden lived through the Cold War and Soviet brinksmanship. It’s time for him to shed the smiling, gabby senator persona and channel President John F. Kennedy in the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis; Biden was 19 then. I’m sure he remembers that it took cold courage, a naval blockade and massive U.S. airpower near Cuba to bring that crisis to an end.",7,2.6177048888917955,3.324032140600402,-0.7063272517086063,5

'' The majority of Ukraine’s borders are vulnerable to an invasion by Moscow as roughly half of the country shares a border with Russia. But the threat of an incursion goes beyond Ukraine’s proximity to Russia. The Kremlin has not only amassed roughly 100,000 troops on its southern border but deployed an additional 30,000 troops to neighboring Belarus – whose border is less than a three-hour drive to Kyiv. ""If our country faces an aggression, there will be hundreds of thousands of Russian soldiers here, who will defend this sacred land together with hundreds of thousands of Belarusians,"" Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko warned in late January.

In comments on state television Sunday, Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov also challenged 's claim to be a purely defensive structure. But the threat of conflict has caught the attention of nearly every surrounding Eastern European nation and has considered sending a small contingency of troops to Slovakia. Moldova, which sits under Ukraine, declared independence from the in 1991 but shares a complex past with Russia. A small fraction state called Transdniestria broke away from Moldova in the early 90s and politically aligns itself with Russia. Neither the United Nations, Moldova nor Russia recognize the breakaway state, but Russia has placed roughly 1,000 troops in the region for military drills – a move the Moldovan government has condemned.

""While advancing its military infrastructure very close to our border, and its member states believe that they have a right to teach us where and how we can deploy our armed forces,"" the statement added. The U.S. and have condemned these comments and warned that Russia could look to fabricate an excuse to justify its invasion of Ukraine.",4,2.9288236648018096,2.6315579024818696,0.29726576231993995,3

Biden welcomed German Chancellor Olaf Scholz to the White House for his first official visit to Washington on Monday for what he described as a ""very productive meeting"" in which the two discussed their countries' ""shared values that shape how each of us approaches leadership."" , - Both Biden and Scholz, during a joint press conference Monday, said they spent a significant amount of time discussing the situation between Russia and Ukraine, maintaining their preference to pursue a diplomatic approach to prevent an incursion. ""If Russia makes a choice to further invade Ukraine, we are jointly ready, and all of is ready,"" Biden said, noting that the U.S., Germany, their allies and partners would ""impose swift and severe consequences if Russia violates Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity."" ""We are in agreement that it cannot be business as usual if Russia further invades,"" Biden said. Presidents Biden and Putin Scholz, during his opening remarks, stressed the ""military threat"" in Ukraine and ""against Ukraine."" ""We cannot remain silent,"" Scholz said. The two leaders were pressed on the Nord Stream 2 pipeline and whether that project, which the Biden administration has opposed, would be suspended should Russia invade Ukraine. ""If Russia invades, that means tanks and troops crossing the border of Ukraine again,"" Biden said. ""Then there will be no longer a Nord Stream 2. We will bring an end to it."" When asked how, Biden said: ""We will. I promise you. We will be able to do that."" Scholz, too, was pressed, amid Germany’s growing dependence on the Nord Stream 2 pipeline. ""I want to be absolutely clear: We have intensively prepared everything to be ready with necessary sanctions if there is military action against Ukraine,"" Scholz said. ""You can be sure that there won’t be any measures in which we have a different approach,"" Scholz said of Germany and the United States. ""We will act together and will take all necessary steps."" Biden chimed in, saying that Scholz has ""the complete trust"" of the United States. The Nord Stream 2 has seen a faster development and deployment despite sanctions placed on it by the Trump administration. With those sanctions removed, Germany remains keen to see the pipeline activated sooner rather than later. Scholz has insisted that the pipeline is a ""business project,"" according to German outlet . German Chancellor Olaf Scholz delivers a speech during a meeting of the German federal parliament, Bundestag, at the Reichstag building in Berlin, Germany, Wednesday, Dec. 15, 2021. Biden last year removed sanctions on the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, allowing construction and activation to proceed. The plan to allow Russia to develop the pipeline to create leverage in times of political crisis may have backfired, as Germany has also rapidly grown dependent on the completion and activation of the pipeline. 'S ""I know that he is in a position now to be able to invade, almost assuming that the ground is frozen above Kyiv,"" Biden said. ""He has the capacity to do that. What he is going to do, I don’t know."" He added: ""I don’t think anybody knows but him."" The president urged Americans in Ukraine to leave the country. ""I think it would be wise to leave the country. I am not talking about our diplomatic corps. I am talking about Americans who are there,"" Biden said. ""I would hate for them to get caught in cross-fire, if in fact they did, and there’s no need for that."" At this point, the Pentagon confirmed last week that the U.S. has intelligence that Russia is likely to ""fabricate"" a pretext for an invasion of Ukraine. U.S. officials believe that Russia is planning to ""stage a fake attack by Ukrainian military or intelligence forces against Russian sovereign territory or against Russian-speaking people to therefore justify their action as part of this fake attack,"" Pentagon spokesman John Kirby explained. President Joe Biden delivers remarks on the debt ceiling during an event in the State Dining Room of the White House, Monday, Oct. 4 in Washington.

Two hours north of Ukraine’s capital in an abandoned city outside Chernobyl decades after one of the world’s worst nuclear disasters, Ukrainian forces trained for urban combat in freezing temperatures inside deserted buildings. Fox News attended the live-fire training, which included ambush, sniper, mortar, evacuation and advanced firefighting scenarios. Some 30,000 Russian troops, dozens of attack jets and fourth-generation air defense systems have now massed on Ukraine’s border not far from Chernobyl in neighboring Belarus to the north, according to U.S. officials. Asked by a Fox News reporter if he was concerned Russian forces would be invading from Belarus, less than 100 miles from Kyiv, Ukraine’s capital city, the country’s defense chief did not appear worried. ""I am not concerned,"" said Oleksii Reznikov, Ukraine’s defense minister. ""I am very, very sure that the Ukrainian Armed Forces are ready for deterrence, for resilience. The Ukrainian people are also ready for deterrence."" Members of Ukraine's Territorial Defense Forces, volunteer military units of the Armed Forces, train in a city park in Kyiv, Ukraine. ""The word ‘imminent’ doesn’t work,"" he added. ""Keep calm."" While it appears many Ukrainian citizens are heeding that advice, going about their routines, including shopping at the local supermarket, hundreds of others rose early Sunday to begin weapons training offered by Ukrainian military veterans, some who have seen combat in the east, where Ukrainian forces have battled Russian-backed separatists since 2014. Over 14,000 Ukrainians have been killed. ""I am worried about my family and about my children,"" said Valentina, who asked that only her first name be used to protect her identity. ""I would like to share my knowledge with my children. We want to survive."" ""I want to live in a democratic, European country,"" she added. Members of Ukraine's Territorial Defense Forces, volunteer military units of the Armed Forces, train in January 2022. Fox News witnessed the training for local citizens of all ages, which included small-arms familiarization, basic first aid and how to assemble bombs using basic household goods. A group of three Ukrainian teenagers explained why they woke up early on a Sunday and endured the frigid temperatures to attend weapons training. ""We are ready to stand for our country till the end, even if we will need to die for it,"" said Yuriy, who, like the others, would only give his first name. The only female teenager in the group, Maria, admitted she was ""worried"" about a potential Russian invasion. A veteran of Ukraine’s war against Russian-backed separatists was asked how much damage hundreds of citizens could inflict against an invading Russian army. : ""You see five hundred, but I see millions,"" Vladislav Sobolevskiy said Sunday. ""It’s our country. We live here for a thousand years, and we can and will fight Russia."" Ukrainian soldiers perform military exercises in the Donetsk region of Ukraine on Jan. 12. In one demonstration, Ukrainian teenagers were taught how to make Molotov cocktails. The instructor mixed oil and gasoline in a jar, lit a damp rag and hurled the concoction against a brick wall inside an abandoned building. The ramped-up training by Ukrainian forces, citizens and medical personnel took place as U.S. officials in Washington predicted tens of thousands of Ukrainian citizens would be killed if Russian President Vladimir Putin orders a full-scale invasion. : ‘ ’ ""We strongly prefer that Russia choose the path of diplomacy and dialogue, but if it does not, we are fully prepared for the alternative,"" U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Friday next to his Polish counterpart hours before nearly 2,000 American paratroopers from the 82nd Airborne Division touched down in Poland—reinforcements ordered by President Biden. On ""Fox News Sunday,"" a top aide to the president warned a Russian invasion could come ""any day"" or perhaps over the next few weeks.

On the subject of a Russian invasion of Ukraine, however, Sullivan said the U.S. is only prepared to defend allies and not get involved on the ground in Ukraine – even if it means Kyiv falls quickly like Kabul, Afghanistan, did to the Taliban last year. - ""The president has been clear for months now that the United States is not sending forces to start a war or fight a war with Russia in Ukraine. We have sent forces to Europe to defend territory. We have a sacred obligation under Article 5 to defend our allies – Poland, and Romania and the Baltic states. We have made that commitment to them, we will keep that commitment to them."" As far as Ukraine, Sullivan said the U.S. can provide ""defensive assistance"" and ""other forms of support."" Sullivan also addressed a recent join statement from Russia and China, in which the two countries discussed international relations and the strengthening of their partnership. They said they ""reaffirm their strong mutual support for the protection of their core interests, state sovereignty and territorial integrity, and oppose interference by external forces in their internal affairs.""

Zelenskyy, though, said Ukraine is ""not seeing any escalation bigger than before,"" and said the Russian build-up of troops could be an attempt by Moscow to exert ""psychological pressure"" and sow panic. And Russia has denied it intends to launch an attack. Russian officials said must promise not to allow Ukraine to join the alliance, among other demands, which the United States and have rejected. Russia Ambassador Vasily Nebenzya on Monday slammed the West, claiming it is trying to will a Ukrainian war into existence. ""The deployment of Russian troops within our own territory has frequently occurred on varying scales before and has not caused any hysterics whatsoever,"" he said.

The U.S. and once again flatly rejected the Kremlin’s calls for an admission ban on the former Soviet nation but said it would be willing to negotiate troop and missile deployment.

Washington and its allies did propose several options to negotiate arms agreements and a ""transparency mechanism"" which would reveal where some ""missile-launching bases"" are located in allied nations like Romania and Bulgaria as well as in Russia. The U.S. chided Moscow for breaking the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty with its production of -8 missiles, ground-launched cruise missiles, which prompted the U.S. to pull out of the 1987 agreement in 2019.

Pentagon press secretary John Kirby said Sunday that while the U.S. still hopes to avoid any conflict between Russia and Ukraine, Russian President Vladimir Putin could possibly invade his neighboring country at any point now, and that there are a number of methods at his disposal to do it. In a conversation with ""Fox News Sunday,"" Kirby's outlook of the immediate future of the region was a grim one, despite Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zalenskyy claiming that the U.S. was overstating the direness of the situation. Backing up his position, Kirby pointed to Russian troops amassed on the Russia-Ukraine border and in Belarus, in addition to Russian activity in the Mediterranean Sea and Atlantic Ocean. , : ‘ ’ ""Putin has a lot of options available to him if he wants to further invade Ukraine, and he can execute some of those options imminently,"" Kirby said.

When pressed on what exactly he meant by ""imminently,"" Kirby stated that ""imminent means it could happen, really, honestly, at any time."" He then clarified that what exactly ""it"" is ""depends on what Vladimir Putin might want to do."" Kirby recalled how Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said Friday that Putin has ""a lot of capability available"" to conduct large-scale or small-scale actions. Still, Kirby said, not all hope is lost. ""It doesn’t have to come to conflict. We still believe there’s room and space for diplomacy, and we’d like to see that be the solution here,"" he said. When asked if the U.S. can or should be more specific with threats of sanctions against Russia, such as naming banks that would be affected, Kirby said the U.S. has been ""very clear about the economic consequences that can come his way and the way of the Russian people should he further incur and invade inside Ukraine."" At the same time, Kirby indicated that the U.S. was in no rush to impose sanctions because it would remove an arrow from their quiver. ""One of the things about sanctions is once you trip that, then the deterrent effect is lost,"" Kirby said. Perhaps looking to increase the possible deterrent effect of the threat of sanctions, Kirby said the U.S. is looking at ""sanctions and economic consequences the likes of which we have not looked at before or even considered even as far back as 2014."" The Pentagon press secretary then added that economic harm is not the only thing that Putin should be worried about, as it is not the only avenue the U.S. is looking at. ""One of the last things they want is a strong and bolstered on their western flank and if he does another invasion inside Ukraine that’s exactly what they’re going to get,"" Kirby said.

Markarova downplayed questions about friction between the U.S. and Ukraine over when to introduce sanctions against Russia and reaffirmed that the U.S. is its ""strategic friend."" While Markarova said Ukraine believes the basis for sanctions is there now, the U.S. and European Union countries have said that a Russian invasion would trigger heavy sanctions.

2022-01-29,Fox,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/ukraine-russia-putin-crimea-zelenskyy-nato-judy-miller,Putin's aggression behind sea change in Ukrainian attitudes toward Russia,"Defense Priorities senior fellow discusses how to deter Putin from attacking Ukraine on 'Your World.' When I visited Kyiv in September, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy was a worried man. No one seemed to care, he told a gathering of European officials and foreign policy experts, that Russia had invaded Ukraine’s Crimea in 2014 and occupied it for eight years. His Western allies seemed insufficiently alarmed by the 100,000 Russian troops on his border and Moscow’s constant provocations aimed at destabilizing his government and sparking civil unrest. Few outsiders mourned the more than 13,200 Ukrainians who had already died fighting Russian-backed separatist forces in the eastern region of Donbas or the two million who had been displaced by the low-intensity war, a conflict that even then was claiming a Ukrainian soldier’s life every three days. : , ‘’ The West’s seeming indifference to the specter of an escalating full-blown conflict on the European continent for the first time since the Cold War, he complained, left him feeling politically isolated and Ukraine increasingly vulnerable. When it came to battling Russia or the deadliest global pandemic in modern times, the gap between the West's rhetorical support for his country and its actions led him to conclude that Ukraine was on its own. In such crises, he lamented, ""it's every man for himself."" However belated, the U.S. has finally made it clear that Zelenskyy is not on his own. While President Joe Biden has repeatedly ruled out a military response by the U.S or its allies should Russia invade Ukraine again, he has warned Russian President Vladimir Putin that further military aggression will result in what he recently called ""massive consequences and severe economic costs."" Paradoxically, some of Biden’s toughest measures to date – i.e., the actual delivery on Saturday of long-promised weapons to Kyiv and the threat to possibly deploy some 8,500 U.S. forces to bolster front-line Russian members – came after Biden stumbled badly by saying that a ""minor"" Russian incursion into Ukraine might not trigger a painful economic and diplomatic response. , - 19: U.S. President Joe Biden answers questions during a news conference in the East Room of the White House on January 19, 2022 in Washington, . With his approval rating hovering around 42-percent, Biden is approaching the end of his first year in the Oval Office with inflation rising, -19 surging and his legislative agenda stalled on Capitol Hill. And paradoxically, Biden’s blunder may inadvertently have toughened America’s policy. ""Of course, talking about possibly sending additional troops to Eastern Europe is not the same as actually sending them,"" said John Herbst, a veteran diplomat, former ambassador to Ukraine, and current senior director of the Atlantic Council's Eurasia Center. ""But it may be significant enough to do the job."" Although Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman said Wednesday there was ""every indication"" that Putin was preparing to use more force against Ukraine – though not during the upcoming Winter Olympics in Beijing in February, which he is planning to attend and which would embarrass his rival/ally China – Herbst said he believes that Putin may ultimately decide not to do so. While Putin has repeatedly argued that Ukraine is linguistically, culturally, and historically an integral part of ""Russia’s world"" and that Russian national security is threatened by Ukraine’s desire to join the European Union and – neither of which is likely to happen any time soon – Herbst argues that Putin probably knows how risky such a course might be. For one thing, as Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dimitri Kuleba said this week, if one of Putin’s major foreign policy goals is getting forces to withdraw from Eastern Europe, a full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine would only ""accelerate what he fears."" Second, Herbst and others argue, Putin knows that apart from its nuclear prowess, Russia is economically weak and that sanctions could further depress his economy and intensify political pressures on his regime whose popularity is dropping. Russia is already suffering economically from the threatened economic sanctions. As the Wall Street Journal reported Thursday, Russian stocks fell eight percent this week and the ruble dropped to a 14-month low. organ Chase bank has already stopped handling the ruble and closed all its positions in Russian currency, saying the possibility of war makes trading in rubles too risky. Even if Washington cannot persuade Germany to cancel the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline that will deliver to Germans Russian natural gas, by-passing Ukraine, and fails to persuade other European allies to expel Russia from the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication , which facilitates international money transfers, the U.S. could increase financial pressure on Russia by sanctioning companies and countries that buy Russian debt. But perhaps one of the most potent deterrents may be Ukrainians themselves. Although Ukrainian forces are no match for the Russian army, ""this is not the Ukraine of years ago,"" Wendy Sherman warned Putin in her remarks to a forum sponsored by the Kyiv-based Yalta European Strategy . ""This is a country that will stand up for itself. Russia needs to know,"" she warned, that an invasion ""will cost Russian lives."" While that may matter little to a brutal autocrat like Putin, video on and social media of Ukrainians fighting and killing Russians is likely to undermine his argument that Russians and Ukrainians are ""brothers"" and that Russophobia is the handiwork of U.S. and plotting. Indeed, Moscow’s seizure of Crimea and the ongoing war in the Donbas have sparked a sea change in Ukrainian attitudes toward Mother Russia. Whereas young Ukrainians once spoke to one another in Russian, Ukrainian is increasingly their language of choice. Whereas pro-Russian political parties once won presidential elections and formed majorities in parliament, they now struggle to secure the 20 percent required for participation. Although Russia has been conducting intensive destabilization operations in Ukraine for eight years, it boasts few successes. If anything, loyalty to Ukraine, especially among young Ukrainians, who lack their grandparents’ nostalgia for Soviet rule, has been reinforced by Putin’s autocratic rule at home and his aggression towards them and other former Soviet republics abroad. Though it might pain him to acknowledge it, said Herbst, ""Putin is the father of Ukrainian nationalism.""",4,2.7859528977170593,3.2273365251497044,-0.44138362743264503,2

Current and former U.S. officials say concrete indicators, like blood supplies, are critical in determining whether Moscow would be prepared to carry out an invasion, if Russian President Vladimir Putin decided to do so. The disclosure of the blood supplies by U.S. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, adds another piece of context to growing U.S. warnings that Russia could be preparing for a new invasion of Ukraine as it masses more than 100,000 troops near its borders. : , ‘’ These warnings have included President Joe Biden's prediction that a Russian assault was likely and U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken's remarks that Russia could launch a new attack on Ukraine at ""very short notice."" The Pentagon has previously acknowledged the deployment of ""medical support"" as part of Russia's buildup. But the disclosure of blood supplies adds a level of detail that experts say is critical to determining Russian military readiness. ""It doesn't guarantee that there's going to be another attack, but you would not execute another attack unless you have that in hand,"" said Ben Hodges, a retired U.S. lieutenant general now with the Center for European Policy Analysis research institute. The Russian defense ministry did not immediately respond to a written request for comment. A White House spokesperson did not immediately comment on any Russian movement of blood supplies but noted repeated public U.S. warnings about Russian military readiness. The Pentagon declined to discuss intelligence assessments. A satellite image shows tents and housing for Russian troops in Yelnya, Russia, Jan. 19, 2022. Three U.S. officials who spoke about the blood supplies declined to say specifically when the United States detected their movement to formations near Ukraine. However, two of them said it was within recent weeks. Russian officials have repeatedly denied planning to invade. But Moscow says it feels menaced by Kyiv's growing ties with the West. , Eight years ago, it seized Crimea and backed separatist forces who took control of large parts of eastern Ukraine. Russia's security demands, presented in December, include an end to further enlargement, barring Ukraine from ever joining and pulling back the alliance's forces and weaponry from eastern European countries that joined after the Cold War.

""Any Russian attack or further incursion into Ukraine would not only ignite conflict, it would also violate the bedrock principles of national sovereignty, territorial integrity and self-determination,"" he said, noting that the United States is taking this ""very seriously, both as a strong partner of Ukraine and as one of 30 members of who are unified in opposition to Russia’s attempts to undermine those core values and threaten peace and security in Europe."" : ‘ ': Austin said, at this point, ""conflict is not inevitable.""

""The United States, in lockstep with our allies and partners, has offered Russia a path away from crisis and toward greater security."" Austin said the Department of Defense will ""continue to support"" diplomatic efforts, and maintained that the U.S. ""remains committed to helping Ukraine defend itself through security assistance material."" Austin said that since 2014, the United States has committed more than $2.7 billion in security assistance to Ukraine, noting that President Biden, in December authorized an additional $200 million in assistance, which included javelins and other weapons and equipment. ""The United States will stand should to shoulder with our allies and that includes reinforcing security on ’s eastern flank,"" Austin said.

Meanwhile, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark Milley addressed the situation should Russia choose to invade Ukraine, explaining that ""it will not be cost free in terms of casualties or other significant effects."" ""There is a small contingent of U.S. and advisors and trainers currently in Ukraine,"" Milley explained, adding that the U.S. ""has zero offensive combat weapon systems nor any permanent forces or bases in Ukraine."" ""Our role is limited and that we help train, advise and assist with tactics, techniques and procedures,"" Milley said. ""We participate in institutional development of the Ukrainian ministry of defense."" ""The president and the secretary of Defense have authorized the United States military to increase our readiness in the event we have to reinforce or assist our allies,"" Milley continued. He added: ""War is not inevitable, as the secretary said, the right answer here is a diplomatic solution."" But Milley did set the scene, telling reporters Friday that ""given the type of forces that are arrayed, the ground maneuver forces, the artillery, the ballistic missiles, the air forces, all of it packaged together, if that was unleashed on Ukraine, it would be significant. Very significant."" ""And it would result in a significant amount of casualties,"" he stressed. ""And you can imagine what that might look like in dense urban areas, along roads and so on. And so it would be horrific. It would be terrible and it's not necessary."" Milley did warn, though, that there is ""a potential"" that Russia ""could launch on very, very little warning."" ""That's possible, and there's a wide scale of options that are available to Russian leadership, and the best option they should pick, in my view, is a diplomatic solution to resolve whatever differences they have,"" Milley said. But Russian Foreign Minister Sergey. Lavrov told Russia radio stations Friday that ""we don’t want wars,"" despite amassing more than 125,000 troops along Ukraine’s border. ""If it depends on Russia , then there will be no war. We don't want wars. But we also won't allow our interests to be rudely trampled, to be ignored,"" Lavrov said, according to Reuters. - Lavrov reportedly added that he expects to meet with U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken in the coming weeks, one day after saying that the U.S. and ’s responses to its security demands in relation to Ukraine offer ""little ground for optimism."" Meanwhile, the State Department on Thursday unequivocally warned that if Russia invades Ukraine the Nord Stream 2 pipeline will sit unused at the bottom of the ocean. The controversial pipeline has become the U.S. and ’s biggest bargaining chip in its attempts to preserve Kyiv’s sovereignty. And earlier this week, Biden administration officials told Fox News that they are also preparing ""severe"" sanctions against Russia should it invade Ukraine, which would have an ""immediate and visible effect on the day they are implemented."" ""That means the gradualism of the past is out, and this time, we will start at the top of the escalation ladder and stay there,"" a senior administration official said. ""We've made efforts to signal this intention very clearly, and I would say, a deepening selloff in Russian markets, its borrowing costs, the value of its currency market, imply default risk, reflect the severity of the economy consequences we can and will impose on the Russian economy in the event of a further invasion."" Ukraine's territory has long been in Putin's crosshairs, especially amid recent considerations of potentially allowing Ukraine to join the alliance. It is one of several post-Soviet republics in the region that shifted toward an alliance with the West after the collapse of the Soviet Union.

The lessons come as concerns persist over a potential Russian invasion of Ukraine. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba suggested Thursday that Russia could remain on a ""diplomatic track"" for the next two weeks following talks in Paris with officials from Moscow, Ukraine, France and Germany.

""So let me get this straight, we are debating whether to defend Ukraine’s border but our illustrious president has no plan to defend ours?"" said Lahren Lahren went on to discuss the turmoil occurring in Eastern Europe and Biden's current postulating a decision on whether to get involved and provide support to the Ukrainian border with Russia.

The arrival of jets comes as President Biden is weighing whether to deploy thousands of U.S. troops to Eastern Europe to bolster a broader effort to protect allied countries bordering Russia and Ukraine.

The troop deployment would be part of a broader effort. Other countries may also contribute troops to warn Russian President Vladimir Putin not to try to move into neighboring countries. , ; As part of the effort, Biden is also considering deploying naval vessels for allies who may feel threatened. Some equipment and troops in these proposed actions would come from Europe and some would come from the U.S. said that it is ""sending additional ships and fighter jets"" to Eastern Europe. This includes F-16s from Denmark, naval forces from Spain, and F-35s from The Netherlands. France is ready to send troops to Romania, which borders Ukraine to the south. As Biden weighs deploying troop, the State Department ordered the evacuation of American citizens in Ukraine on Sunday. Officials also ordered family members of employees at the United States Embassy in Kyiv to leave the country. That announcement came after the U.K.'s Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office announced on Saturday that it had information suggesting that the Russian government is plotting to install a pro-Kremlin leader in Kyiv. Ukraine's territory has long been in Putin's crosshairs, especially amid recent considerations of potentially allowing Ukraine to join the alliance. It is one of several post-Soviet republics in the region that shifted toward an alliance with the West after the collapse of the Soviet Union. Putin was in the Soviet for many years before beginning his political career, and has said the collapse of the Soviet Union was the ""greatest geopolitical catastrophe"" of the 20th century. : Putin also stresses Russian ethnic and cultural influences in Ukraine as reasons why it should be part of Russia.

Sherman also met with her Russian counterpart earlier this month in Vienna in an attempt to find a diplomatic resolution to the building crisis. Russia submitted a security proposal to the U.S. in December, urging the U.S. to pledge to not allow Ukraine to join as well as a commitment to withdraw forces from the region. The U.S. promised to deliver a written response to those demands following a meeting last week between U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov. But Sherman said that U.S. officials believe the Beijing Winter Olympics may also impact the timing of any invasion. ‘ ’ 'S 'T ""We all are aware that the Beijing Olympics begin on February 4, the opening ceremony, and President Putin expects to be there,"" Sherman explained. ""I think that probably President Xi Jinping would not be ecstatic if Putin chose that moment to invade Ukraine, so that may affect his timing and his thinking."" Sherman stressed that while the U.S. is pushing for diplomacy, it is also ""preparing for the worst."" She reiterated that ""even one Russian troop further invading Ukraine is a very serious matter"" – a stance Biden made clear following his misstep in saying that a European response may depend on the nature of the invasion, such as whether it was a ""minor"" incursion or not.

Fox News contributor Daniel Hoffman explained during comments to Fox News Digital on Tuesday that Russian President Vladimir Putin has a ""menu of options"" for taking hostile action toward Ukraine. Putin, who has amassed 100,000 troops on the Ukraine border, is also using the American response to his actions to discern the vulnerabilities of the United States, warned Hoffman, who had a distinguished career with the Central Intelligence Agency, where he was a three-time station chief and a senior executive Clandestine Services officer.

""That's why the Biden administration would have wanted Putin to know it was prepared to provide material support to Ukrainians, so they could fight a counterinsurgency against Russia.

""I have a high level of confidence Putin will do something,"" he said. ""As far as what that is, I'm not even sure if Putin has decided yet."" Hoffman said that Putin is attempting to increase the tension by threatening Ukraine and imposing a sense that an immediate response is necessary. ""He's making it hard to conduct any sort of diplomacy,"" he said. ""He doesn't really want to do that, so he's getting a good look at how we are prepared to respond. And how we are prepared to respond is what's going to inform his decision about what to do."" The Pentagon announced Monday that the United States heightened the readiness of some 8,500 U.S. troops amid tensions, but no decisions have been made yet to deploy them.

Russia has sent an unspecified number of troops from the country's far east to its ally Belarus, which shares a border with Ukraine, for major war games next month. In 2014, following the ouster of a Kremlin-friendly president in Ukraine, Moscow annexed the Crimean Peninsula and threw its weight behind a separatist insurgency in the country's industrial heartland in the east. The fighting between Ukrainian forces and Russia-backed rebels has since killed over 14,000 people, and efforts to reach a peaceful settlement of the conflict have stalled. In the latest standoff, Russia has demanded guarantees from the West that would never allow Ukraine to join and that the alliance would curtail other actions, such as stationing troops in former Soviet bloc countries.

""All we're doing today, Martha, is telling these units you need to get ready and you need to be ready to go on a shorter timeline than maybe you were before. No deployment orders have been signed today,"" Kirby said. ""They're not leaving the United States today or in the imminent future, but we want to make sure that they're ready in case they're asked."" ""These [U.S.] troops, if activated by the alliance, not by the United States … would go to 's allies, mostly on the eastern flank of the alliance, [who] would want that kind of capability, additional robust defensive capability inside their borders,"" Kirby said. MacCallum countered that sending American troops to the Eastern front wouldn't necessarily deter Putin from once again invading Ukraine, as he would then not be met immediately by Western forces. ‘ ’: ""But that wouldn't prevent Vladimir Putin from going into Ukraine, just because there are troops that are positioned in other countries around there, and especially when he knows -- and has been told by the White House – that no U.S. troops are going to enter Ukraine,"" MacCallum responded.

""We don't we don't know exactly what Mr. Putin has in mind, but this is designed to make sure that we are meeting our commitments to the 's alliance,"" he said. ‘ ’ Biden previously came under fire for comments made during last week's press conference in which the president said ""it depends on what [Russia] does,"" while making reference to a potential ""minor incursion"" versus a full-scale invasion. Those comments were met with a strong rebuke from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who said ""there are no minor incursions"" when it comes to an independent country like his. ""What President Biden has made clear is that there will be severe economic consequences if [Putin] does make another incursion into Ukraine, and the international community will respond as well,"" Kirby said. ""The purpose of these troops is to bolster and reassure our allies, and that's what they will be going to do."" MacCallum went on to note that in Kyiv itself, the State Department has already ordered some embassy staff to begin booking private airfare out of the country, which some observers noted may be to avoid any panicked last-minute evacuations as seen last August in Kabul, Afghanistan. Kirby said there are no plans to involve the U.S. military in any such evacuations from Kiev. MacCallum reiterated how the potential movement of troops into the region may not be a strong enough deterrent for aggressive Kremlin action: , - Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky presents his national statement during day two of 26. ""So what I'm hearing is that there's movement of some material, some support for Ukraine troops that could potentially be in other countries. So I guess what is evident in all of that is that it doesn't necessarily deter Vladimir Putin from entering Ukraine. The only thing that he would face would be potential economic sanctions if he goes ahead and does it,"" she said. Kirby said the Russians would then encounter a much stronger Ukrainian military force than they did when they invaded Crimea in 2014. ""We are continuing to flow security assistance to them, arms and ammunition. In fact, we had just a couple over the course of the weekend, which arrived in Ukraine -- just from the United States alone -- not to mention the kind of security assistance that the Ukrainians are getting from other 's partners and allies in Europe. So they are a more capable force,"" he said. ""The economic consequences are not to be shrugged off Martha. They're significant and severe, as some of them are ones we've not chosen to use before, and it would just further isolate Russia from the international community. "" MacCallum and Kirby both noted that the American presence in Ukraine remains limited to advisers and ""trainers"" and not any engagement force.

U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov are meeting in Geneva, once a key Cold War crossroads, trying to avert a possible Russian invasion of Ukraine amid Moscow’s demands for concessions from over its relationship with the former Soviet republic. Blinken on Thursday played down any prospects of an immediate fix in the Geneva talks, which are set to run about two hours, saying resolving the difficult issues ""won’t happen quickly"" – and emphasizing that he doesn’t expect a resolution on Friday. Washington and its allies have repeatedly promised ""severe"" consequences such as biting economic sanctions — though not military action — against Russia if an invasion goes ahead by 100,000 Russian troops who have been positioned near the Ukrainian border for weeks. After meeting with Ukraine’s president in Kyiv and top diplomats from Britain, France and Germany in Berlin this week, Blinken was set for a face-to-face with Lavrov that is shaping up as a possible last-ditch effort at dialogue and a negotiated agreement — but both sides sticking to so-far-irreconcilable red lines. On Thursday in Berlin, Blinken warned of a ""swift, severe"" response from the U.S. and its allies if an invasion is launched, and the U.S. Treasury Department slapped new sanctions on four Ukrainian officials. Blinken said the four were at the center of a Kremlin effort begun in 2020 to damage Ukraine’s ability to ""independently function.""

Blinken took pains to stress U.S. unity with its allies in opposition to a possible Russian invasion — and tried to do just that Thursday, a day after U.S. President Joe Biden drew widespread criticism for saying retaliation for Russian aggression in Ukraine would depend on the details and that a ""minor incursion"" could prompt discord among Western allies. On Thursday, Biden cautioned that any Russian troop movements across Ukraine’s border would constitute an invasion and that Moscow would ""pay a heavy price"" for such an action. ""I’ve been absolutely clear with President Putin,"" Biden said. ""He has no misunderstanding: Any, any assembled Russian units move across the Ukrainian border, that is an invasion.""

2022-01-21,Fox,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/russia-hybrid-war-ukraine-kt-mcfarland,Russia's hybrid war against Ukraine has already begun,"'Special Report' panel breaks down President Biden's Wednesday news conference. Today, Europe seems on the brink of war. Russian has massed troops along the border with Ukraine and launched cyberattacks. The Pentagon revealed Russia has already sent agents across the border to begin false flag operations. Russia’s hybrid war against Ukraine has already begun, an invasion could follow. While American officials are scurrying around Europe trying to stave off a crisis, President Biden seemed to give Putin a qualified green light at his Wednesday press conference when he said a ""minor incursion"" into Ukraine might not trigger a response. A day later Biden tried to clarify his remarks, defining an invasion as ""any assembled Russian units move across the Ukrainian border."" But he only made matters worse. A ? Putin doesn’t need a hot war to achieve his objectives of isolating and destabilizing Ukraine. Hybrid warfare may even be his preferred option – it is just as effective but holds less risk of things spinning out of control or triggering a European or American response. False flag operations, cyberattacks and disinformation campaigns are slow-rolling, ambiguous and anonymous. If this crisis had happened a year ago, things might have been different. Last year, America held all the high cards - we were emerging from with a strong economy. Oil and gas prices were low, employment was high and inflation non-existent. Meanwhile, Russia was suffering from greatly reduced energy revenues, a sputtering economy, and widespread outbreaks with no effective vaccine or treatment in sight. How did things get this bad, this fast? But oh how things have changed in just a year! Upon taking office, President Biden reversed course on President Trump’s policies and threw all our high cards away. Today our economy is flagging, inflation is at an all-time high, we’re importing expensive oil again, and President Biden is perceived as weak, incompetent, and unpopular. . . Vladimir Putin has spent the last year seizing this unexpected opportunity. He is now poised to realize his decades’ long objective – to restore the Russian empire. Ultimately, Putin would like to bring Ukraine back under Moscow’s historic control. At a minimum, he would prevent Ukraine from forging closer economic ties with the West and joining , figuring Ukraine would eventually fall into his lap. How did things get this bad, this fast? Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky talks during a press conference with Secretary General after their bilateral meeting at the European Union headquarters in Brussels on December 16, 2021. It’s all about energy – ours and theirs. A year ago, America had abundant, reliable, inexpensive supplies of oil and natural gas. We were a net energy exporter. The Keystone Pipeline was ready to go operational and boost our already booming energy industry. But President Biden cancelled the Keystone Pipeline and added piles of new regulations and penalties to stifle the American energy industry. Predictably, America went from energy independence to once again being dependent on expensive imports. Predictably, the price of oil and gas skyrocketed and home and abroad. A year ago, oil was $40 a barrel, today it is $80 a barrel. The harsh reality is Putin could invade Ukraine anytime in the days or weeks ahead. He has moved 100,000 troops on the border, and pre-positioned supplies and equipment to support thousands more. His missiles are pointed to Kiev. Americans now pay twice or three times as much for a gallon of gas as we did a year ago, sparking inflation and stifling economic growth. On the other hand, high energy prices have given energy exporter Russia windfall profits. – January 19, 2022: U.S. President Joe Biden holds a formal news conference in the East Room of the White House, in Washington, D.C. To make matters worse, Biden gave go-ahead for Russia’s Nord Stream 2 Pipeline. The European economy already depends on Russia for over a third of its energy needs. Once the new pipeline is operational, those countries, especially Germany, won’t function without Russian natural gas to heat their homes and power their factories. Russia will get even richer. Today Europe is in the grips of an energy crisis, with shortages and skyrocketing prices. They are paying twice as much to heat their homes than they did last year. Their leaders are unlikely to risk a disruption in energy imports – and their post-lockdown economic recovery - over a fight with Russia over Ukraine. – Russian President Vladimir Putin speaks during a news conference after his meeting with U.S President Joe Biden at the 'Villa la Grange' in Geneva, Switzerland in Geneva, Switzerland, Wednesday, June 16, 2021. ) The new German Chancellor just declared a military option was off the table and refused to send lethal weapons to Ukraine. Germany’s message to Ukraine – you’re on your own. Germany’s message to Putin – if you make a move on Ukraine we may complain, slap on a few sanctions, but we’re not willing to sacrifice much to keep Ukraine free. Add to that Biden’s green light to Putin’s ""minor incursions"". Putin now has a free hand and a lot of high cards to play. The harsh reality is Putin could invade Ukraine anytime in the days or weeks ahead. He has moved 100,000 troops on the border, and pre-positioned supplies and equipment to support thousands more. His missiles are pointed to Kiev. Or he could maintain limited, hybrid war for months, with untraceable cyberattacks, inexplicable gas pipeline outages, false flag operations, anonymous disinformation campaigns. When tanks move across a border, it’s clear who is the aggressor. But in hybrid warfare the aggressor leaves no obvious fingerprints. It would give Europe, especially Germany the excuse they want to do nothing. Or he could choose to pocket for now his success in isolating Ukraine and keeping it out of . Putin has lots of options, and his decision is the only one that counts. With Europe dependent on Russian energy, Moscow’s coffers flush with oil and gas revenues and an American president on the ropes, Putin holds all high cards.

'S ‘’ : The president has already rejected it and that is to do something preemptively militarily and economically to deter the attack. He has rejected all of those proposals, so there is no sense in going down that laundry list again. What he is relying on is he wants to deter the attack based on the threat of the consequences the United States and would impose on Russia. That’s why his statement yesterday that casted doubt on that is so specious and also there is no uniformity among the Europeans on what the specifics of the economic sanctions should be. Even some of the tough ones, like taking them out of the international financial messaging system and also Nord Stream 2. There’s not unanimity on that and the Russians know it. So there is likely going to be no deterrence to Russia from attacking based on what we would do after, in my judgment.",4,2.8707698972812303,2.8926374932274843,-0.02186759594625398,2

Donbas, located in eastern Ukraine, is under control of Russia-backed separatists who have fought Ukrainian forces for nearly eight years, a conflict that has killed more than 14,000 people. Ukraine said earlier this week that it has taken the delivery of anti-tank missiles from the U.K. It has rejected Moscow’s claims that it plans an offensive to reclaim control of separatist-held areas in the country’s eastern industrial heartland. Ukraine's government, the U.S. and its allies have expressed intensifying concerns in recent weeks over a Russian troop buildup near Ukraine. The concentration of an estimated 100,000 Russian troops near Ukraine has fueled Western fears that Moscow is poised to attack its neighbor. U.S. President Biden said Wednesday he thinks Russia will invade Ukraine and warned President Vladimir Putin that his country would pay a ""dear price"" in lives lost and a possible cutoff from the global banking system if it does. Moscow has repeatedly denied having plans to launch an offensive. But it has sought a set of security guarantees from the West that would exclude 's expansion to Ukraine and other ex-Soviet nations and the deployment of alliance weapons there. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the U.S. threat to cut off Russia from the global banking system could encourage hawkish forces in Ukraine to use force to reclaim control of the rebel east. ""It may implant false hopes in the hotheads of some representatives of the Ukrainian leadership who may decide to quietly restart a civil war in their country,"" Peskov said in a conference call with reporters. Washington and its allies firmly rejected Moscow’s demands in security talks last week but kept the door open to possible further talks on arms control and confidence-building measures to reduce the potential for hostilities.

""I can tell you that when an ambassador is nominated, that person will have the full confidence of the president of the United States, that person will be someone that is well known to me and with whom I have a close relationship, and that person will have very demonstrable expertise and knowledge in this region,"" he said. ""And I would anticipate that a nomination will be forthcoming very shortly. Blinken visited Kyiv at a time of increased tensions between Washington and Moscow over Ukraine, with signs that Russia might be planning to invade. Blinken said Russia has ""ratcheted up its threats and amassed nearly 100,000 forces on Ukraine’s border, which it could double on relatively short order."" He underscored what he called a ""steadfast commitment"" to Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity. He called on Russian President Vladimir Putin to remove the forces from the border A series of talks last week between Russia, the U.S. and failed to ease the tensions over Ukraine and Russia has been moving troops for war games in Belarus – with Ukraine warning that Russia could launch an attack from multiple directions.

Blinken will also be traveling to Berlin to meet with European allies ahead of the meeting with Lavrov. Russia has called on the U.S. to ban Ukraine from ever joining and to reduce the military presence in Eastern Europe – the U.S. has dismissed those demands. Moscow has also said it can deploy its forces wherever it wants to within its own borders. Amid the tensions, the Biden administration has announced an additional $200 million in military aid to the European ally. Kuleba, meanwhile, expressed thanks for the U.S. support and confidence that it could overcome the threat posed by Moscow. ""While we understand all the risks that are associated with aggression of the Russian Federation, we have to be confident that we would be able to overcome this very hard period in our history,"" he said.

Blinken will be in Kyiv on the hastily arranged trip to show U.S. support following inconclusive diplomatic talks between Moscow and the West in Europe last week that failed to resolve stark disagreements over Ukraine and other security matters. Instead, those meetings appear to have increased fears of a Russian invasion, and the Biden administration has accused Russia of preparing a ""false flag operation"" to use as a pretext for intervention. Russia has angrily denied the charge. Secretary of State Antony Blinken speaks in the briefing room of the State Department in Washington, Jan. 7, 2022. Blinken will visit Ukraine this week as tensions between the U.S. and Russia escalate over a possible Russian invasion of its neighbor. Blinken’s ""travel and consultations are part of the diplomatic efforts to de-escalate the tension caused by Russia’s military build-up and continued aggression against Ukraine,"" the State Department said in a statement. From Kyiv, Blinken will travel to Berlin, where he will meet with his German, British and French counterparts to discuss a possible response to any Russian military action. Russia has massed some 100,000 troops with tanks and other heavy weapons on its own soil near the Ukrainian border in what many observers believe may be preparation for an invasion. Blinken will meet with Zelenskyy and Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba on Wednesday ""to reinforce the United States’ commitment to Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity,"" the State Department said. ""The trip follows extensive diplomacy with our European Allies and partners about a united approach to address the threat Russia poses to Ukraine and our joint efforts to encourage it to choose diplomacy and de-escalation in the interests of security and stability,"" the department said. On Monday, Russia’s top diplomat rejected the U.S. allegations that it was preparing a pretext to invade Ukraine. Speaking to reporters, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov dismissed the U.S. claim as ""total disinformation."" Lavrov reaffirmed that Russia expects a written response this week from the U.S. and its allies to Moscow’s request for binding guarantees that will not embrace Ukraine or any other ex-Soviet nations or station its forces and weapons there. Washington and its allies firmly rejected Moscow’s demands during last week's Russia-U.S. negotiations in Geneva and a related -Russia meeting in Brussels. Secretary of State Antony Blinken pauses while speaking in the briefing room of the State Department in Washington, Jan. 7, 2022. The White House said Friday that U.S. intelligence officials had concluded that Russia had already deployed operatives to rebel-controlled eastern Ukraine to carry out acts of sabotage there and blame them on Ukraine to create a pretext for possible invasion. Ahead of Blinken's visit to Kyiv, a delegation of U.S. senators was visiting Ukraine to emphasize congressional support for the country. ""Our bipartisan congressional delegation sends a clear message to the global community: the United States stands in unwavering support of our Ukrainian partners to defend their sovereignty and in the face of persistent Russian aggression,"" Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, a New Hampshire Democrat, said in a statement. Speaking Monday on a visit to Kyiv, German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock warned that ""any further escalation would carry a high price for the Russian regime — economic, political and strategic,"" and she emphasized the need to continue negotiations. ""We are prepared to have a serious dialogue with Russia, because diplomacy is the only way to defuse this highly dangerous situation at the moment,"" she said.

Deputy Defense Minister Alexander Fomin said the drills would involve practicing a joint response to external threats by Russia and Belarus, which have close political, economic and military ties. Ukrainian officials have warned that neighboring Russia could launch an attack from various directions, including from Belarus. A Russian tank T-72B3 fires as troops take part in drills at the Kadamovskiy firing range in the Rostov region in southern Russia, on Jan. 12, 2022. A series of talks last week between Russia, the U.S. and failed to quell the tensions over Ukraine. U.S. Secertary of State Antony Blinken is set to meet his Russian counterpart in Geneva on Friday in another attempt to deescalate tensions. Russia already has started moving troops for the war games in Belarus. Fomin said it would take through Feb. 9 to fully deploy weapons and personnel for the Allied Resolve 2022 drills, which are expected to take place Feb. 10-20. As part of the exercises to ""thwart and repel a foreign aggression,"" Russia will deploy a dozen Su-35 fighter jets and several air defense units to Belarus, Fomin said. He did not say how many troops and weapons were being redeployed for the exercises, or give the number of troops that will participate in the war games. The deployment would dramatically bolster an estimated 100,000 Russian troops with tanks and other heavy weapons amassed near Ukraine in what the West fears could be a prelude to an invasion. Russia has denied an intention to attack its neighbor but demanded guarantees from the West that will not expand to Ukraine or other ex-Soviet nations or place its troops and weapons there. Washington and its allies firmly rejected Moscow’s demands during Russia-U.S. negotiations in Geneva and a related -Russia meeting in Brussels last week. Fomin said the drills in Belarus, which involve moving an unspecified number of troops from Russia's Eastern Military District that encompasses Eastern Siberia and the Far East, reflect the need to practice concentrating the country's entire military potential in western Russia. ""A situation may arise when forces and means of the regional group of forces will be insufficient to ensure reliable security of the union state, and we must be ready to strengthen it,"" Fomin said at a meeting with foreign military attaches. ""We have reached an understanding with Belarus that it's necessary to engage the entire military potential for joint defense."" Belarus' authoritarian president, Alexander Lukashenko, said the joint maneuvers will be conducted on Belarus’ western border and also in the country’s south, where it borders Ukraine. Lukashenko has increasingly relied on the Kremlin’s support amid Western sanctions over a brutal crackdown on domestic protests in Belarus. Amid the tensions, Ukraine's Defense Ministry said Tuesday it was speeding up efforts to form reserve battalions that would allow for the rapid deployment of 130,000 recruits to expand the country's 246,000-strong military. The battalions from the newly formed Territorial Defense Forces could include reservists between the ages of 18 and 60. The United States and its allies have urged Russia to deescalate the situation by calling back the troops amassed near Ukraine. ""In recent weeks, more than 100,000 Russian troops with tanks and guns have gathered near Ukraine without an understandable reason, and it’s hard not to understand that as a threat,"" German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock told reporters Tuesday after talks in Moscow with her Russian counterpart, Sergey Lavrov. Lavrov responded by restating Moscow's argument that it's free to deploy its forces wherever it considers it necessary on its territory. In this handout photo released by Russian Foreign Ministry Press Service, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock attend a joint news conference following their talks in Moscow, Russia, Tuesday, Jan. 18, 2022. ""We can’t accept demands about our armed forces on our own territory,"" Lavrov said, adding that ""troops’ training is something that every country does."" ""We aren’t threatening anyone, but we are hearing threats to us,"" he added. ""We will decide how to react depending on what specific steps our partners will take."" Baerbock emphasized that the West was ready to continue a dialogue with Russia to help defuse tensions. ""We are prepared for a serious dialogue on mutual agreements and steps to bring everyone in Europe more security,"" she said, calling last week's security talks a ""first sensible step toward such a dialogue."" Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg met with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz in Berlin on Tuesday. He said ""the main task now is to make progress on the political way forward"" to prevent a military attack against Ukraine. "" allies are ready to meet with Russia again, and today I have invited Russia and all the allies to attend a series of meetings in the -Russia Council in the near future to address our concerns but also listen to Russia’s concerns,"" Stoltenberg said. He added that will soon deliver its written proposals in response to Russian demands and ""hopefully we can begin meeting after that."" ""We need to see what Russia says, and that will be a kind of pivotal moment,"" the chief said. Lavrov, meanwhile, reaffirmed that Russia wants a quick Western answer to its demand for security guarantees that would preclude 's expansion to Ukraine and limit its presence in Eastern Europe. He repeated that view in a phone conversation with Blinken, who is to visit Ukraine on Wednesday and meet with Lavrov on Friday. Lavrov also urged Blinken ""not to spread speculation about the alleged ‘Russian aggression’ being prepared,"" the Russian Foreign Ministry said in its readout of the call. Baerbock, who traveled to Moscow a day after visiting Kyiv, emphasized the importance of strengthening a 2015 peace agreement on eastern Ukraine that was sponsored by France and Germany and reached in the capital of Belarus, Minsk.

The Kremlin has presented a draft Russia-U.S. security treaty and a blueprint for a Russia- agreement as a starting point for this week’s negotiations. They would oblige the alliance not to station any troops in areas where they weren't present in 1997 — before moved to incorporate former Soviet bloc countries and ex-Soviet republics. Moscow’s proposals also suggest a freeze on patrols by Russian and U.S. naval ships and bombers near each other’s frontiers. In addition, they call for efforts to reduce the risk of incidents involving Russia and warships and aircraft, primarily in the Baltic and the Black Seas; a reduction in the scope of military drills; greater transparency and other confidence-building measures. U.S. The U.S. and its allies have roundly rejected the demand for not to admit Ukraine or any other new members, emphasizing that a key alliance principle is that membership is open to any qualifying country and no outsiders have veto power.

Even though the allies firmly rejected a halt to ’s expansion as a nonstarter, Washington and say they are ready to discuss arms control, confidence-building measures, greater transparency and risk reduction if Russia takes a constructive stance. U.S. officials said they are open to discussions on curtailing possible future deployments of offensive missiles in Ukraine and putting limits on American and military exercises in Eastern Europe if Russia is willing to back off on Ukraine. At the same time, the White House has urged Russia to help create a positive environment for the upcoming talks by pulling back its troops from areas near Ukraine.

'T The announcement comes just one day after Russian President Vladimir Putin threatened to take military-based ""reciprocal measures"" to counter what he argued were ""unfriendly steps"" by the U.S. and . Putin alleged the Kremlin was ""fully entitled to these actions that are designed to ensure Russia’s security and independence."" Putin’s warning followed what the Pentagon said were unfounded accusations by Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu, who claimed U.S. contractors were smuggling ""unidentified chemical components"" into Ukraine. Russian President Vladimir Putin addresses an extended meeting of the Russian Defense Ministry Board at the National Defense Control Center in Moscow, Russia, Tuesday, Dec. 21, 2021. Tensions between the U.S. and have spiked in recent weeks with Russia’s continued military buildup along the Ukrainian border. The White House and its western allies have repeatedly warned Putin that if he invades Ukraine there will be serious repercussions. But U.S. intelligence officials have said they believe Russia plans to invade Ukraine in the New Year – a multifront invasion that could include as many as 175,000 troops. Pentagon press secretary John Kirby on Tuesday rejected the accusations by Shoigu as ""completely false."" Tuesday’s statements are in line with comments made earlier this month by Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov, who suggested without providing evidence that was looking to deploy intermediate-range nuclear missiles in Europe.

Russian President Vladimir Putin's speech at a meeting with Russia's top military brass came just days after Moscow submitted draft security documents demanding that deny membership to Ukraine and other former Soviet countries and roll back the alliance’s military deployments in Central and Eastern Europe – bold ultimatums that are almost certain to be rejected. The demands – contained in a proposed Russia-U.S. security treaty and a security agreement between Moscow and – were drafted amid soaring tensions over a Russian troop buildup near Ukraine that has stoked fears of a possible invasion. Russia has denied it has plans to attack its neighbor but pressed for legal guarantees that would rule out expansion and weapons deployment there. Russian President Vladimir Putin addresses the Russian Defense Ministry Board at the National Defense Control Center in Moscow, Russia, Tuesday, Dec. 21, 2021. Putin charged Tuesday that if U.S. and missile systems appear in Ukraine, it will take those missiles only minutes to reach Moscow. ""For us, it is the most serious challenge – a challenge to our security,"" he said, adding that this is why the Kremlin needs ""long-term, legally binding guarantees"" from the West, as opposed to ""verbal assurances, words and promises"" that Moscow can't trust. Putin noted that has expanded eastward since the late 1990s while giving assurances that Russia’s worries were groundless. ""What is happening now, tensions that are building up in Europe, is their fault every step of the way,"" the Russian leader said. ""Russia has been forced to respond at every step. The situation kept worsening and worsening, deteriorating and deteriorating. And here we are today, in a situation when we're forced to resolve it somehow."" Russia’s relations with the U.S. sank to post-Cold War lows after it annexed the Crimean Peninsula from Ukraine in 2014 – gaining control over long coastlines of the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov – and backed a separatist insurgency in eastern Ukraine that still controls territory there. Tensions reignited in recent weeks after Moscow massed tens of thousands of troops near Ukraine’s border. President Vladimir Putin noted that has expanded eastward since the late 1990s while giving assurances that Russia’s worries were groundless. Putin has pressed the West for guarantees that will not expand to Ukraine or deploy its forces there and raised the issue during a video call with U.S. President Biden two weeks ago. Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu charged Tuesday that more than 120 staff of U.S. private military companies are currently operating in two villages in war-torn eastern Ukraine, training Ukrainian troops and setting up firing positions in residential buildings and different facilities. Putin said the U.S. ""should understand we have nowhere to retreat."" ""What they are now trying to do and plan to do at Ukraine’s territory, it’s not thousands of kilometers away, it’s happening right at the doorstep of our house,"" he said. Russian leader Vladimir Putin raised the issue of expansion in a video call with President Joe Biden two weeks ago. Putin added that Moscow hopes ""constructive, meaningful talks with a visible end result – and within a certain time frame – that would ensure equal security for all.""",4,1.3575302365007378,2.764912556498512,-1.4073823199977742,7

Longtime politician Sam Brownback is warning that the U.S. is diluting ""human rights"" and undermining their foundation by inappropriately applying that label to certain things. His comments came on Thursday, just before the United Nations Human Rights Day. The day is observed every year on Dec. 10 – the same day that the United Nations General Assembly adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, accompanied by Sam Brownback, ambassador at large for international religious freedom, speaks during a news conference at the State Department in Washington, D.C., on June 10, 2020. Brownback took special aim at the Biden administration, which he said isn't doing enough on human rights. ""I don't think they've handled it [human rights] very well,"" said Brownback, who served as President Trump's U.S. ambassador-at-large for international religious freedom. 'S , ""I think they've gone back to the old route of trying to categorize too many things as a human right and not focusing on the basic ones,"" he added. ""I think we're letting the foundation crumble on human rights by doing that. We're not taking care of the foundation and we're trying to build a bigger house on it."" Brownback suggested returning to the ""basics,"" arguing that religious freedom was a foundational right that shouldn't be put on the same level as others. ""When you have – everything's a human right, then nothing's really a human right,"" said Brownback. ""And it lets countries like China and Russia really belittle and pick and choose the human rights they will stand by."" The Biden administration has declared, among other things, that ""Transgender rights are human rights.""

On Friday, Secretary of State Antony Blinken commemorated Human Rights Day with a statement that outlined a long list of human rights abuses. ""As the world confronts genocide and other atrocities, systemic racism and inequity, erosion of freedom of expression, oppression and marginalization because of one’s race, ethnicity, gender, religion, sexual orientation or identity, and often simply for expressing dissenting views, among many other human rights abuses, the is more important than ever,"" said Blinken.

""We have a moral obligation and a legal obligation to our allies if they were to attack under Article 5, that's a sacred obligation. That obligation does not extend to ... Ukraine."" President Joe Biden Biden's comments come after he had a two-hour phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin Tuesday, with officials saying the call between the two leaders grew tense with 70,000 troops along the Russia-Ukraine border. He also said hopes for meetings about Putin's concerns over Ukraine joining . ""We hope by Friday we'll be able to say, to announce to you that we're having meetings at a higher level, not just with us but with at least four major allies and Russia, to discuss the future of Russia's concerns relative to writ large and whether or not we can work out any accommodations when it comes to bringing down the temperature along the eastern front,"" Biden said. ' ': But the president did say he made clear to Putin that the U.S. would impose severe sanctions on Russia should it invade Ukraine, noting that such sanctions would have ""severe"" economic consequences. ""I was very straightforward. There were no minced words. I was polite, but I made it very clear: If, in fact, he invades Ukraine, there will be severe consequences. Severe consequences. Economic consequences like none he's ever seen or ever have been seen, in terms of being imposed,"" Biden said. Biden said Putin clearly received the message. ""He knows. His immediate response was he understood that,"" Biden said. White House officials said Biden's phone call with Putin ended without the president gaining any clarity on whether the Russian leader had made up his mind to launch an attack, though both leaders spoke Wednesday about the possibility of opening up new diplomatic channels in an effort to avoid the outbreak of war. Putin has argued that the presence of troops near the Russian border threatens its national security, a situation made worse by Ukraine's potential future membership in the defense bloc. Russian President Vladimir Putin Ukraine has been attempting to gain membership into for several years.

2021-12-08,Fox,https://www.foxnews.com/world/putin-ukraine-catastrophic-war,Why Putin is willing to risk a catastrophic war to dominate Ukraine,"Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, joined 'The Faulkner Focus' to explain how Biden's Afghanistan withdrawal enabled Russia's aggression toward Ukraine. The Russian troops assembled at its border with Ukraine send a clear signal to Kyiv, Europe and the United States that Russia might finally be ready to reincorporate Ukraine into Russia’s sphere of influence, severely increasing the risk of a major military escalation in Europe’s eastern frontier. Ukraine’s defense minister, Oleksiy Reznikov, warned of a ""bloody massacre"" if Russia dared to invade Ukraine and the White House signaled that there would be a ""real cost"" to any Russian aggression against Ukraine. President Biden spoke with Russian President Vladimir Putin in a high-stakes phone call to de-escalate the crisis. Biden warned Putin that the U.S. is prepared to impose ""severe consequences,"" including stifling economic sanctions, if Russia were to violate Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity. National security adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters after the phone call that, in order to deter Russian aggression, ""things we did not do in 2014 we are prepared to do now."" Biden made no concessions or assurances toward Ukraine’s future in . President Biden also spoke with his fellow and European Union allies to ensure transatlantic unity against the threat posed by Russia. Russia currently has more than 90,000 troops massed on the border with Ukraine, and U.S. intelligence estimates that nearly 175,000 could be deployed for a full-scale invasion in early 2022. Satellite imagery also has revealed the buildup of heavy military equipment and artillery along the border. Putin’s latest moves are being taken very seriously in Kyiv and the Ukrainian defense establishment has been clamoring the U.S. for greater military assistance. - : A Russia’s military buildup against Ukraine comes amid the backdrop of heightened tensions in the region after the manufactured border crisis between Poland and Belarus, where Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko, a close ally of President Putin, was encouraging migrants to swarm the border with Poland to foment chaos and undermine European Union solidarity over the divisive issue of immigration. The question confronting policymakers is what Vladimir Putin’s true intentions are and would he take such bold action in the face of stiff and united condemnation from the U.S. and European Union allies. President Biden and Russia's President Vladimir Putin meet for talks at the Villa La Grange in Geneva, Switzerland, on June 16, 2021. Putin appears emboldened on the international stage and faces very little opposition to his rule at home. His main rival, opposition leader Alexei Navalny, was poisoned and then imprisoned for his activism and dissent while Putin’s political party, United Russia, won a clear majority in the September elections to the lower house of parliament, known as the Duma. Putin’s saber-rattling is seen as a coercive signal to the West that any further actions by Ukraine to move closer to membership is a redline and wants guarantees that Ukraine will not join the alliance, nor will any troops be stationed along the border with Russia. The ""fortress under siege"" mentality that defines Putin’s worldview, and Russian foreign policy historically, took on a new form after the Cold War. With the Soviet Union defeated, it called into question the very mandate of ’s existence, that is, to oppose Communism throughout the world. U.S. leaders assured Russia that would not expand eastward in the 1990s. ""The Russians are angry at the West’s violation of a pledge—made at the Cold War’s end, to induce their withdrawal from East Germany—not to expand eastward. They are distrustful because has repeatedly gone beyond its defensive charter to bomb countries into regime change, from Serbia to Libya,"" University of Southern California professor Robert English told Fox News. Any incursions into eastern Ukraine would fit into Putin’s playbook of having a high tolerance for risk if it can achieve what he wants. Georgia was on a similar path to possible E.U. and membership in 2008 when Russia invaded in support of two separatist republics. The war with Georgia prevented further ascension for Tbilisi and kept Georgia internally fractured and within Russia’s historic sphere of influence. "" ascension historically often precedes E.U. ascension and once Ukraine is in , its pro-Western path is locked in, so everything must be done to prevent this from happening because it becomes difficult to unwind the process,"" Matthew Orr, Stratfor Eurasia analyst at , told Fox News. The simple fact remains: Putin’s designs in Ukraine are nothing new, and he has made his views on Ukraine’s place in the world very clear over the course of his 20 years in power. Putin told President George W. Bush at a summit in 2008 that Ukraine was not a country. In a 5,000-word article published in July 2021, Putin does not equivocate in articulating his worldview of historical grievance which includes Ukraine as an integral part of the Russian Nation. Putin maintains that Russians and Ukrainians are ""one people"" and questions the legitimacy of Ukraine’s borders. Putin turned hostile rhetoric into action in 2014 after pro-Russian Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych was ousted in the ""Revolution of Dignity"" over his failure to forge closer economic ties with the E.U. Yanukovych fled to Russia and for a brief moment there was hope that Ukraine could finally orient itself toward the West. As Ukrainians demanded closer links to Europe and with a weak transitional government in Kyiv following the revolution, Russia took advantage of Ukraine’s vulnerability and invaded and eventually annexed the Crimean Peninsula in March 2014. Russian special forces, aided by pro-Russian separatist forces in the southeast, invaded the Donbas region of Ukraine and declared an independent ""People’s Republic."" The frozen conflict in eastern Ukraine killed over 14,000 people and left millions more displaced. It’s unclear whether the threat of crippling sanctions from the Biden administration will have any impact or change Putin’s behavior. In Putin’s mind, it would be unacceptable to have a stable and democratic Ukraine on Russia’s border. ' ,' : ""Putin needs this conflict to hang over Ukraine because he can’t let it become a stable functioning state, which would set a dangerous precedent for Russia. If Ukraine can become pro-Western and democratic then the people of Russia and Belarus might want to go down the same path, which is a threat to Putin’s rule,"" Orr said. Putin’s imperial mindset is grounded in the belief that the collapse of the Soviet Union was, as he once put it, the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the 20th century. When the Soviet Union fell apart in 1991, it lost many of its constituent republics, including Ukraine. It seems obvious that Putin’s grievances surrounding the collapse of the Soviet Union and the humiliation it experienced in the turbulent 1990s is foundational to his grand strategy of turning Russia into a great power once again and peer competitor of the United States. ""Putin understands that Ukrainian statehood and the Ukrainian national idea pose a threat to Russian imperialism,"" said Danylo Lubkivsky, director of the Kyiv Security Forum. After the takeover of Crimea and the invasion of the Donbas, Russia began an incremental process of integrating the stolen territory into Russia’s sphere of influence. The occupied territories switched to the Russian ruble and Moscow started to provide substantial economic assistance to the beleaguered areas. Russian President Vladimir Putin attended a flower-laying ceremony at the Russian Civil War memorial on Unity Day, in Sevastopol, Crimea, on Nov. 4, 2021. The difference between Russia’s sudden invasion and capture of Crimea in 2014 and the current environment is the steady and unrelenting resolve of the Ukrainian people and its armed forces. Ukraine’s military is far more advanced in its capabilities than it was when Russia invaded in 2014, with greater military assistance from the U.S. Russia’s actions since the invasion of Crimea and Donbas has had the counterproductive effect of uniting the Ukrainian people against Russian domination. It’s unclear whether the threat of crippling sanctions from the Biden administration will have any impact or change Putin’s behavior. Sanctions imposed on Russia after its invasion of Crimea did little to change Putin’s calculus. It might be a tough concession to make, but assurances that Ukraine will not join might be the best possible solution to ease tensions. Many across Europe already believe that it would be a dangerous and provocative move to incorporate Ukraine into the military alliance and that bringing in other divided or unstable countries made little positive contribution to European and Western security.",4,2.7163261272967767,2.203838863898875,0.5124872633979018,2

With a massive build of Russian troops near Ukraine’s border, Russia’s Vladimir Putin is indicating a willingness to risk a military conflict, but analysts say while the threat is serious, an invasion is not certain. The threat of an invasion will be the central subject of President Biden’s video call with Putin on Tuesday. Biden is expected to warn of dire consequences should Russia follow through with a military offensive, while Putin is expected to reiterate his ultimatum that should not allow Ukraine to join its military alliance. The outcome of the video call could have major implications as Putin weighs the potential costs of a full-fledged invasion of Ukraine. Jim Townsend, a former Pentagon official and adjunct senior fellow in the Transatlantic Security Program, said Putin is an ""opportunist"" who sees an invasion as one of several potential pathways for achieving his goals in the region. , : 4 Russian President Vladimir Putin holds a video conference to address participants in a congress of the United Russia party marking the 20th anniversary of the party founding, in Moscow, Russia, Saturday, Dec. 4, 2021. ""If he feels the response from the West is not going to be as painful as we think it is, then he’s got that option to invade,"" Townsend said. ""But if he’s going to get indications from the West that he’s going to get out of it [something] he finds valuable, that could make him change his mind, too."" U.S. intelligence officials conclude Russia is planning for a military offensive by as soon as early next year. A senior administration official said Russia’s plan includes 100 battalion tactical groups and an estimated 175,000 military personnel, half of whom are already near the border.

2021-11-26,Fox,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/russia-attack-ukraine-winter-biden-putin-robert-maginnis,Why it's better than a 50-50 chance that Russia will attack Ukraine this winter,"Fox News' foreign correspondent has the latest on the tensions between Russia and Ukraine as an estimated 100,000 Russian troops gather at the border The director of Ukraine’s defense agency anticipates Russian forces now amassed with hundreds of heavy fighting vehicles parked near the Russia-Ukraine border will attack by the end of January or early February 2022, according to the Military Times. The only question is when and that decision comes down to the Russian president’s calculation of what President Joe Biden and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization might do in response. Russian President Vladimir Putin has taken a measure of Biden and found him weak. Besides, the recent trip to Ukraine by Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin restirred calls for the government in Kiev to join , something Putin swears will never happen. A 2022 To put a stop to Kiev’s rush to membership Putin is readying his forces to attack this winter. That assault is likely to involve airstrikes, artillery and armor formations assisted by a deep penetration inside Ukraine by airborne forces and amphibious assaults into the critical ports of Odessa and Mariupul. But first anticipate a feint from Belarus toward Poland to draw ’s attention away from Ukraine accompanied by some nuclear saber-rattling in the Baltic region. Earlier this fall Russia’s large-scale Zapad 21 military exercise in Belarus was a rehearsal for the possible coming Ukraine invasion. That exercise dropped 3,500 airborne troops with special operators, a necessary strategic step to soften the enemy’s rear area to ensure success of massed armor formations crossing the international border. Ukraine’s defense minister Oleksii Reznikov admitted the timing of any invasion remains unclear and that Putin has not as yet decided but it’s clear the Russians are rapidly building capacity to do so. They have significant forces, including tens of thousands of reservists called up in recent months, weapons platforms to include Iskandar short-range ballistic missile systems and other long-range weapons at the Ukraine border region. Significant publicly available satellite imaginary testifies to these massed Russian forces and their offensive equipment. Biden is weak in the eyes of Putin and we can thank the sad U.S. military withdrawal fiasco from Afghanistan for fueling the Russian’s thinking. Of course, any attack will likely follow the scenario seen with Moscow’s 2008 invasion of the Republic of Georgia and after the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi when Russian forces took Crimea and sparked the ongoing insurgency in Ukraine’s east. Each of those advances began with Russian forces launching a series of psychological operations and cyber-attacks. A similar scenario is already in motion across Ukraine. Ukraine’s head of intelligence, Brig. Gen. Kyrylo Budanov, admitted ""They [the Russians] want to foment unrest, through protests and meetings, that show the people are against the government,"" an obvious justification for ""Mother Russia"" to rush to the rescue of its former satellite as it did in the Republic of Georgia and Crimea. Budanov identified a recent example of Russian-created unrest inside Ukraine. He fingered the Russian-created anti-Ukraine sentiment attributed to the incident labeled ""Wagnergate,"" a controversy involving scores of Russian mercenaries hired by a Russian oligarch friend of Putin responsible for attacks inside Ukraine. It’s noteworthy we’ve seen the Wagner Group doing Putin’s bidding inside Syria, in several African countries and even elsewhere in Eastern Europe. Will Putin attack Ukraine this winter? I give it a better than 50-50 chance. Why? Biden is weak in the eyes of Putin and we can thank the sad U.S. military withdrawal fiasco from Afghanistan for fueling the Russian’s thinking. Further, the time is ripe for a foreign distraction because Biden is unpopular at home, he has many domestic challenges and a pesky congressional election in November 2022 that could result in his party losing both the Senate and the House of Representatives. Further, Putin sees that his ally Chinese President Xi Jinping has a similar view about weak Biden, which explains China’s military build-up across the Taiwan Strait and the possible coming take-down of democratic Taiwan. Clearly the domestic and geopolitical challenges are mounting for the Biden administration, a true test of his foreign policy mettle. I have serious doubts Biden and his administration are up to the task of discouraging the likes of Putin and Xi from taking bold action to recover lands they long-ago claimed are theirs.",4,3.0446889620232622,3.712073190999147,-0.6673842289758847,3

Ukraine says Moscow kept about 90,000 troops near their common border following massive war games in western Russia earlier this year. The Ukrainian Defense Ministry said units of the Russian 41st army remain near Yelnya, about 160 miles north of the border. Moscow denies that it’s planning any invasion and refuses to provide details about troop movements on its own territory.

He did not say what those costs would be. ""This is the second time this year that Russia has amassed a large and unusual concentration of forces in the region,"" Stoltenberg told reporters. He said it includes tanks, artillery, armored units, drones and electronic warfare systems, as well as combat-ready troops. ""This military buildup is unprovoked and unexplained. It raises tensions and it risks miscalculations,"" Stoltenberg said. He conceded that ""there is no certainty about the intentions of Russia"" but said that ""this is a military buildup by a country that has invaded Ukraine before."" Russia annexed Ukraine’s Crimean Peninsula in 2014 after the country’s Moscow-friendly president was driven from power by mass protests. Weeks later, Russia threw its weight behind a separatist insurgency that broke out in Ukraine’s east. Ukraine and the West accused Russia of sending its troops and weapons to back the rebels. Moscow denied that, saying that Russians who joined the separatists were volunteers. More than 14,000 people have died in the fighting that devastated Ukraine’s eastern industrial heartland known as Donbas. A 2015 peace agreement brokered by France and Germany helped end large-scale battles, but efforts to reach a political settlement have failed, and sporadic skirmishes have continued along the tense line of contact.

""That poses a real threat of possibly being able to win a war with a single blow by means of an attack,"" Peter Vincent Pry, the executive director of the Task Force on National and Homeland Security, said during a virtual forum hosted by the Universal Peace Federation Tuesday. ""Moreover … they don’t envision employing an by itself. It would be used in conjunction with cyberattacks and physical sabotage, and non-nuclear ."" The U.S. electric grid and other infrastructure – such as communications and transportation systems and water and sewer services – could all be devastated by such an attack, experts like Pry warn, noting that time is of the essence for the U.S. to defend itself. Chinese President Xi Jinping U.S. 'S China already possesses ""super s"" and last summer tested a new hypersonic glide vehicle that analysts warn could deploy the and cause a long-lasting blackout that would shut down key infrastructure and cripple the military's ability to communicate. While such an attack would be ""bloodless"" at first, experts warn that a yearlong blackout caused by an could kill an estimated 90% of the American population. ""It’s bloodless, at least initially,"" said Plamen Doynov, a professor at the University of Missouri-Kansas City and chief technology officer at the company Shield. More worrisome is the idea that countries without cutting edge military technology could successfully launch an attack, meaning less advanced adversaries such as North Korea could strike a devastating blow against the U.S. homeland. '' : ' ' ""There is no need for precision. North Korea doesn’t need to have a very good ballistic missile in order to precisely deploy and detonate the weapon,"" Doynov warned. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un China has invested heavily in its program, with a strategy that ""emphasizes suppressing, degrading, disrupting or deceiving enemy electronic equipment throughout the continuum of a conflict while protecting its ability to use the cyber and electromagnetic spectrum,"" reads a recent Pentagon report on Chinese military capabilities. ""The is likely to use electronic warfare early in a conflict as a signaling mechanism to warn and deter adversary offensive action. Potential targets include adversary systems operating in radio, radar, microwave, infrared and optical frequency ranges, as well as adversary computer and information systems."" If China or any other adversary such as Russia were to successfully cause a large scale blackout, Pry warns that there is little the U.S. could do in response. While the U.S. possesses the technology and capability to defend the nation's infrastructure from such an attack, deploying it across a country that has several different state agencies and utility companies responsible for the grid will be a challenge. ""We do know how to protect against it. It’s not a technological problem. It’s a political problem,"" Pry said. Former President Donald Trump took steps in 2019 to begin addressing that challenge, signing an executive order that directed government-wide coordination to defend against an attack. David Winks, the managing director of electromagnetic resilience firm AcquSight, believes more can be done, including using some of the resources in President Biden's massive infrastructure package to begin hardening the nation's defenses against an attack. President Joe Biden ""There are active protection measures that will ground the pulse as it strikes the electric system of a vehicle, for example,"" Winks said.

It said specifically that units of the Russian 41st army have remained in Yelnya, about 160 miles north of the Ukrainian border. , Russia has cast its weight behind a separatist insurgency in Ukraine’s east that erupted shortly after Moscow's 2014 annexation of Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula and has left more than 14,000 people dead. Russia has repeatedly denied any presence of its troops in eastern Ukraine. Earlier this year, a massive buildup of Russian troops in the country’s west raised concern in Ukraine and in the West, fueling fears of an escalation of large-scale hostilities. Russian officials said the troops were deployed for maneuvers, casting them as part of measures to counter security threats posed by the deployment of forces near Russian borders. Russia and the alliance also have blamed each other for conducting destabilizing military exercises near the borders. Turner, appearing on ""Tucker Carlson Tonight"" on Wednesday, pressed for U.S. military aid to Ukraine. ""We've not asked anybody to go to war with Russia, or send troops to Russia for Ukraine for the purposes of going to war with Russia,"" Turner explained. ""But it is incredibly important that they be providing lethal weapons and intelligence."" Turner, pointing to the Biden administration's chaotic withdrawal of U.S. military from Afghanistan, warned that ""both Russia and China are now looking at threatening their neighbors – including Taiwan, including Ukraine – countries that are important to our allies."" He added: ""Ukraine is a democracy. Russia is an authoritarian regime that is seeking to impose its will on a valuably elected democracy in Ukraine.""

The gang, which calls itself Grief, published a handful of what appear to be the files on a dark web site. The files, reviewed by The Associated Press, relate to grants the has awarded. Ransomware gangs often post a victim’s files publicly in hopes of spurring them to pay out a ransom. Multiple companies have cut ties with the National Rifle Association after the Parkland, Fla., high school shooting. , - - spokesman Andrew Arulanandam said on Twitter that the ""does not discuss matters relating to its physical or electronic security"" and takes ""extraordinary measures"" to protect its information. A person with direct knowledge of the situation who was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity, said the has had problems with its email system this week — a potential sign of a ransomware attack. Ransomware attacks have spiked in recent years against all manner of companies and organizations, but rarely are the targets as politically sensitive as the . The group has long enjoyed close ties to top Republican lawmakers and been a been a major supporter of Republican candidates. The spent tens of millions of dollar in the past two presidential elections trying to help Donald Trump. The group has been beset by legal and financial troubles in recent years but remains a potent force politically and has more than 5 million members. Allan Liska, an intelligence analyst at the cybersecurity firm Recorded Future, said it's highly unusual for a politically active group such as the to be targeted by ransomware gangs, but he said there is no evidence the attack was politically motivated. He said ransomware gangs usually do not target organizations, but vulnerable technologies. ""It's not likely that this was specifically targeted at the , the just happened to get hit,"" he said. ""You never know, though."" Liska said the email problems could be related to the ransomware attack. He said email systems are top targets of ransomware gangs because they often contain sensitive information and hamper an organization's response to an attack, further incentivizing them to pay a ransom. Spokespeople for the did not immediately return a message seeking comment. Greif is believed by many cybersecurity experts to be linked to Evil Corp, a ransomware gang that was previously active. The U.S. Treasury Department imposed sanctions on the group in 2019, saying it had stolen more than $100 million from banks and financial institutions in 40 countries. U.S. and Russian ties have already been strained this year over a string of high-profile ransomware attacks against American targets launched by Russia-based cyber gangs. President Joe Biden has warned Russian President Vladimir Putin in an effort to get him to crack down on ransomware criminals, but several top Biden administration cybersecurity officials have said recently that they have seen no evidence of that.",20,4.745735850260206,4.520935557474631,0.22480029278557545,8
2021-10-25,Fox,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/microsoft-says-russian-group-behind-solarwinds-attack-now-targeting-it-supply-chain,Microsoft says Russian group behind SolarWinds attack now targeting IT supply chain,"Microsoft on Monday warned that the same Russian group behind the SolarWinds cyber attack in 2020 has been attempting to ""replicate"" that approach, now targeting organizations ""integral"" to the global supply chain — specifically resellers and technology service providers. Microsoft Corporate Vice President of Customer Security & Trust Tom Burt shared the ""latest activity"" the company has observed from Russian nation-state actor Nobelium. Burt, in a blog post, said Nobelium was identified by the U.S. government and others as being part of Russia’s foreign intelligence service, known as the . , ""Nobelium has been attempting to replicate the approach it has used in past attacks by targeting organizations integral to the global supply chain,"" Burt wrote. ""This time, it is attacking a different part of the supply chain: resellers and other technology service providers that customize, deploy and manage cloud services and other technologies on behalf of their customers."" Burt added that Microsoft believes Nobelium ""ultimately hopes to piggyback on any direct access that resellers may have to their customers’ systems and more easily impersonate an organization’s trusted technology partner to gain access to their downstream customers."" Microsoft said it began observing Nobelium’s latest activity in May 2021 and said it has been notifying ""impacted partners and customers, while also developing new technical assistance and guidance for the reseller community."" ""Since May, we have notified more than 140 resellers and technology service providers that have been targeted by Nobelium,"" Burt wrote. ""We continue to investigate, but to date we believe as many as 14 of these resellers and service providers have been compromised."" Microsoft said it discovered the campaign ""during its early stages"" and said it is sharing developments to cloud service resellers, technology providers and customers to take ""timely steps to help ensure Nobelium is not more successful."" Microsoft said that the attacks on this sector of the global supply chain have been a part of a ""larger wave"" of Nobelium activities over the summer. Burt said that between July 1 and Oct. 19, Microsoft informed 609 customers that they had been attacked 22,868 times by Nobelium, with a success rate in the low single digits. ""By comparison, prior to July 1, 2021, we had notified customers about attacks from all nation-state actors 20,5000 over the past three years,"" Burt wrote. Microsoft warned, though, that the activity is ""another indicator that Russia is trying to gain long-term, systematic access to a variety of points in the technology supply chain and establish a mechanism for surveilling--now or in the future--targets of interest to the Russian government."" Microsoft, detailing the attacks, explained that they do not appear to be an attempt to ""exploit any flaw or vulnerability in software"" but rather the utilization of ""well-known techniques, like password spray and phishing, to steal legitimate credentials and gain privileged access."" Microsoft said that the company ""can now provide actionable information which can be used to defend against this new approach."" Microsoft said it has been coordinating with others in the security community and has been ""working closely with government agencies in the U.S. and Europe."" ""While we are clear-eyed that nation-states, including Russia, will not stop attacks like these overnight, we believe steps like the cybersecurity executive order in the U.S., and the greater coordination and information sharing we’ve seen between industry and government in the past two years, have put us all in a much better position to defend against them,"" Burt wrote. ‘ ’ ‘’ Meanwhile, a senior administration official explained that the activities Microsoft described taking place were ""unsophisticated password spray and phishing attempts for the purpose of surveillance that cybersecurity experts say are attempted every day by Russia and other foreign governments and have been for years."" The official said these types of attempts can be prevented if cloud service providers implement ""baseline"" cybersecurity practices, including multi-factor authentication —a measure to require users to authenticate their accounts with more than a password. ""Broadly speaking, the federal government is aggressively using our authorities to protect the Nation from cyber threats, including helping the private sector defend itself through increased intelligence sharing, innovative partnerships to deploy cybersecurity technologies, bilateral and multilateral diplomacy, and measures we do not speak about publicly for national security reasons,"" the official told Fox News. Earlier this year, the Biden administration imposed sanctions on Russia for the SolarWinds computer hack, which began in 2020 when malicious code was snuck into updates to popular software that monitors computer networks of businesses and governments. The malware, affecting a product made by the American SolarWinds, gave elite hackers remote access into an organization's networks so they could steal information. - ; Earlier this month, Biden hosted virtual meetings with more than 30 countries to ""accelerate cooperation to counter ransomware,"" but the White House did not extend the invitation to Russia, senior administration officials said. The officials noted that the United States and the Kremlin have a ""separate channel"" where they ""actively"" discuss the matter. Officials said the president established a U.S.-Russia experts group for the U.S. to engage ""directly"" on the issue of ransomware. ""We do look to the Russian government to address ransomware criminal activity coming from actors within Russia,"" an official said, adding that the Biden administration has ""also shared information with Russia regarding criminal ransomware activity being conducted from its territory."" ""We’ve seen some steps by the Russian government, and are looking to see follow up actions and broader international cooperation is an important line of effort, because these are transnational criminal organizations,"" an official said, adding that they ""leverage global infrastructure and money laundering networks to carry out their attacks."" Biden, during his summit in Geneva with Russian President Vladimir Putin in June, raised the issue of ransomware. At the time, Biden said he told Putin that ""certain critical infrastructure should be off limits to attack."" Biden said he gave a list of ""16 specific entities defined as critical infrastructure,"" saying it ranged from energy to water systems. Putin, though, during his press conference after the meeting, denied that Russia was responsible for cyberattacks and instead claimed that the most cyberattacks in the world were carried out from the U.S. Also over the summer, the president signed a national security memo directing his administration to develop cybersecurity performance goals for critical infrastructure in the United States — entities like electricity utility companies, chemical plants and nuclear reactors. Meanwhile, the National Counterintelligence and Security Center last week announced it is prioritizing industry outreach efforts in U.S. technology sectors where the stakes are ""potentially greatest"" for U.S. economic and national security, warning of ""nation-state threats"" posed by China and Russia.

Here's how","K.T. McFarland, former deputy national security advisor for President Trump, on China's government accommodating hackers. On Monday, the Biden administration formally blamed China for a massive cyberattack against Microsoft’s email software that impacted tens of thousands of U.S. businesses, government offices and schools. In response to this attack, the Biden administration opted for the ""name and shame"" approach by calling out China and publicizing an advisory list of more than 50 different tactics used by China’s hackers to target the United States. You can imagine how shaken Xi Jinping and the dictatorship were by being ""named and shamed."" They will accept that swap of action for words every day. During Monday’s press conference, President Biden revealed how weakly he is responding to the real threat of cyberwarfare – and how he fundamentally misunderstands what we are up against. : , – , Speaking at the press conference, Biden said, ""The Chinese government, not unlike the Russian government, is not doing this themselves, but are protecting those who are doing it and maybe even accommodating them being able to do it."" First, let’s be clear: citing senior officials, the Wall Street Journal reported on Monday that ""The U.S. government has high confidence that hackers tied to the Ministry of State Security, or , carried out the unusually indiscriminate hack of Microsoft Exchange Server software that emerged in March."" China’s Ministry of State Security is the equivalent of a combined and that is under the control of the Chinese Communist Party . There is no systematic activity happening in China that is against the wishes of Xi and the Chinese Communist Party. The Western idea of separation between public and private spheres simply does not exist. Second, Biden’s overt response to this attack is not proportionate to the severity of the breach. After the SolarWinds attack gave Russia’s Foreign Intelligence Service hackers access to as many as 18,000 Solarwind customers, including nearly a dozen U.S. government agencies, Biden responded with sanctions and the expulsion of Russian diplomats. But this more recent Microsoft hack was significantly more serious than the Solarwinds infiltration. Speaking to the Wall Street Journal, Dmitri Alperovitch, chairman of Silverado Policy Accelerator, said, ""The Microsoft Exchange hacks by contractors is the most reckless cyber operation we have yet seen from the Chinese actors – much more dangerous than the Russian SolarWindshacks."" Certainly, there could be covert operations underway that may never be made public, but the public response has ultimately created a double standard. Couple this double standard with Biden’s list of 16 sectors that are off limits to hacking and the result is a weak, confusing, public-facing cyber security policy. According to a February Gallup poll 82% of Americans see cyberterrorism as a critical threat. Cyberterrorism is seen as a critical threat by more Americans than any other issue surveyed, including the development of nuclear weapons in North Korea and Iran. As I write in my upcoming book, ""Beyond Biden"" , Americans’ concerns are well warranted considering the scope, scale and severity of cyberattacks against the United States in recent months – and the direct impact these attacks have had on Americans. U.S. must recognize that China’s and Russia’s approaches to warfare are fundamentally different than our own. In May, the Russian DarkSide ransomware attack took the Colonial Pipeline offline, which accounts for about 45% of the fuel supply on the East Coast. Also in May, the same Russian group that was responsible for the Solarwinds hack targeted 3,000 email accounts in 150 organizations as part of a ""continuation of multiple efforts … to target government agencies involved in foreign policy as part of intelligence gathering efforts,"" according to Microsoft. In June, Russian hackers also forced the shutdown of nine beef plants in the U.S. and the same group then launched another attack against Kaseya in July, infecting nearly 1,500 organizations around the world. Importantly, experts noted that in the Kaseya attack, ""The gang used a level of planning and sophistication closer to high-level, government-backed hackers, rather than a mere criminal operation."" President Biden can stand at the podium and attempt to make subtle distinctions between rogue cyber gangs and government-sponsored cyberattacks. But we must ask ourselves the question: In two countries that are ruled by dictators – whose power is ultimately secured through surveillance, control and suppression of dissent – how likely is it that such sophisticated cyber criminals act independent of the regimes? Also, in order to effectively address the ongoing cyber threat, the U.S. must recognize that China’s and Russia’s approaches to warfare are fundamentally different than our own. For example, the 1999 ""Unrestricted Warfare"" publication by two Chinese military colonels concludes that there are ""virtually infinite"" new battlefields in modern warfare that erase the lines between soldiers and civilians. Similarly, according to a U.S. Army assessment, we have not identified an effective counter-strategy to Russia’s gray zone warfighting doctrine , which operates between the zones of war and peace. As the world becomes more digitally interconnected, and as high-value infrastructure targets reside within the private sector, the cyberwarfare threat to America is dangerous, especially within the context of the changing geopolitical landscape. This summer, Beijing and Moscow reaffirmed their commitment to strengthening their strategic partnership by extending their 20-year-old friendship treaty. Russia also agreed to sign on to China’s data security initiative, an effort that was launched in response to the Trump administration’s moves to restrict Chinese technologies that pose national security risks. Further, Russia and China agreed to cooperate on information security and to ""continue to promote the construction of a global system."" The goals of General Secretary Xi and President Vladimir Putin to weaken and supersede the United States are clearly aligned. Biden’s inability to respond firmly to these cyber acts of war only empower the Chinese and Russian dictatorships. It’s time we get serious about fighting this invisible war.

Former Station Chief Dan Hoffman with insight on 'Fox & Friends First.' A senior official who spearheaded the agency’s search for Usama bin Laden has been tapped to lead a task force investigating the cause of the mysterious ""Havana Syndrome,"" which has inflicted cognitive difficulties and even brain damage on scores of U.S. spies and diplomats abroad. Director William J. Burns selected the undercover official whose experience includes spending over a decade at the agency’s Counterterrorism Center working intelligence analysis and targeting focused on bin Laden and his Al Qaeda network, the Wall Street Journal first reported. The individual will now lead a task force first formed in December after a panel of scientists from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine identified ""directed, pulsed radio frequency energy"" as the most likely cause of the ""Havana Syndrome"" – which received that name because symptoms were first reported by diplomats at the U.S. embassy in Cuba’s capital city in 2016. By May, at least 130 unexplained cases of dizziness, headache, fatigue, nausea, anxiety, cognitive difficulties, memory loss and even brain damage were under investigation, up from several dozen last year. Still, no definitive cause has been determined. Just last week, the State Department announced additional cases being investigated at the U.S. embassy in Vienna, Austria. ‘’ : ‘ ’T , ' Vienna has for centuries been a center for espionage and diplomacy and was a hub for clandestine spy-versus-spy activity during the Cold War. It's currently the site of indirect talks between Iran and the U.S. over salvaging the nuclear deal negotiated there in 2015, the Associated Press reported. The task force, comprised of intelligence analysts, clandestine officers who collect human intelligence, clinicians and human resource specialists, will also seek to determine whether any specific individual or group is behind the attacks, The Washington Post also reported. Several former and current officials told the publication they suspect the Russian government, though Moscow has denied any involvement and intelligence hasn’t been able to definitively confirm their responsibility. Burns, who became director in March, has made getting officers afflicted by the Havana Syndrome a top priority and has visited several suffering from more severe cases being treated at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Maryland. News about the task force’s new leadership comes amid historic protests seen in Havana and other Cuban cities, as the subsequent crackdown by the country’s dictatorship has prompted several U.S. politicians of Cuban descent to call on the Biden administration to intervene to protect human rights. Usama bin Laden, who was the leader of the Al Qaeda terrorist group that ordered the 9/11 attacks, was killed in May 2011 by U.S. Navy at his compound in Pakistan after being tracked down through intelligence.

2021-07-06,Fox,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/intelligence-putin-russia-cyberattacks-biden,Rebekah Koffler: Russia's cyberattacks on America expose Biden's weakness,"Former intelligence officer provides insight on the largest-ever ransomware attack on 'America Reports' Another Russian cyber strike on the homeland has demonstrated the wishful thinking of the Biden Administration policy which aims to ""reset"" Russian President Vladimir Putin’s brain into a ""friendly"" one. U.S. President Joe Biden and his coterie of ""experts""––who just finished a summit in Geneva where they sought to ""stabilize"" relations with Russia and asked Putin to limit his cyberattacking habit––are merely projecting weakness to a Russian president who is not seeking stability and views cyberattacks as an invaluable tool. '' Late Friday evening, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency sent out an advisory that it was ""taking action to understand and address"" another on-going ransomware cyberattack. Cybersecurity experts involved in the investigation characterized the attack as ""colossal."" The hack since has been attributed to the same ""Russia-linked"" criminals who struck our meat supply a month earlier, extorting 11 million dollars from the supplier. This time the target list is thousands of companies. The Russians achieved a ""force multiplier effect"" by striking what’s called a supply chain vendor, Kaseya , and multiple managed services that employ software. Thousands of targets were affected, many of which were small and medium-size businesses. Biden’s silly gesture to hand to Putin a list of 16 ""do not attack"" critical infrastructure targets during the summit in June failed to discourage Russia from continuing its cyber offensive. What’s more, it validated what the Russian planners knew all along by studying our responses for two decades. Putin is convinced that Russia’s ""low-grade"" cyber warfare aimed at destabilizing America will not provoke Washington to respond militarily. Russia’s asymmetric doctrine envisions fighting the fight below the threshold of a kinetic confrontation. By allowing another devastating cyberattack on the U.S., just some weeks after President Biden begged Putin to halt cyber strikes on America, Putin demonstrated his lack of respect for Biden. The Kremlin viewed the summit as theater, a propaganda opportunity for Russia that permitted Putin a chance to humiliate Washington while portraying Russia as a superpower ""equal"" to America. ’T ’S ’T A : ‘I ' After the summit, Putin’s ""analysts"" mocked Biden’s team in the Russian press by writing that the ""Americans are more afraid of a cyber war than a nuclear war."" They characterized U.S.-Russia relations as those of ""strategic instability,"" rebuffing the Biden Administration’s ""strategic stability"" agenda for the summit. Russian specialists in U.S.-Russian relations forecast ""no change"" between Washington and Moscow’s posture. Along with sheer disrespect, there’s something even more disturbing that probably drives Putin’s decision calculus to ratchet up his cyber offensive: Moscow views Biden as weak and unlikely to fight back. For months before the summit, the Russian media, most of which is state-controlled, was speculating about the deterioration of Biden’s mental health. They cited the perceived troubles by the U.S. president to ""annunciate words,"" the ""struggles to deliver even short speeches,"" once confusing former president Trump with Putin, and mispronouncing the Russian president’s name as ""Klutin."" There is nothing on a Russian ""news"" site that the Kremlin would not want there. The Russians place a premium on mental acuity for presidents. This is because Moscow, which possesses the world’s largest nuclear arsenal and a complex nuclear employment, is prepared to fight a limited nuclear war if faced in an armed conflict with a conventionally superior power, such as the United States. Unlike his bushy eye-browed Soviet counterpart Leonid Brezhnev, who trembled when faced with a task of pressing the ""button"" in a nuclear training exercise, Putin routinely presides over nuclear drills conducted by the Russian armed forces. Putin, who thoroughly cultivates his image of mental and physical toughness, probably sees the U.S. president as inferior. Biden’s soft and incoherent policy towards Russia likely validates Putin’s conclusion. Despite its harsh rhetoric towards Putin and Russia, the Biden administration canceled economic sanctions on Nordstream 2 and continues to attribute the devastating cyberattacks on American businesses, including our food and gas supplies, to Russia–based hackers, rather than calling out Putin as ultimately responsible. Use of criminal groups to achieve the state’s objectives is a standard operating procedure when it comes to Russia’s approach to cyber warfare. Biden is not getting any younger, but he can wage a tougher policy against Putin. He has said that if he can attribute the latest cyberattack to Russia, he will respond forcefully. He should. But sadly, we may never see it.",20,3.818303562302415,2.997290401093503,0.8210131612089122,2

An advisory released by the U.S. National Security Agency describes attacks by operatives linked to the , the Russian military intelligence agency, which has been previously tied to major cyberattacks abroad and efforts to disrupt the 2016 and 2020 American elections. In a statement, Cybersecurity Director Rob Joyce said the campaign was ""likely ongoing, on a global scale."" : ‘’ Brute force attacks involve the automated spraying of sites with potential passwords until hackers gain access. The advisory urges companies to adopt methods long urged by experts as common-sense cyber hygiene, including the use of multi-factor authentication and mandating strong passwords. Issued during a devastating wave of ransomware attacks on governments and key infrastructure, the advisory does not disclose specific targets of the campaign or its presumed purpose, saying only that hackers have targeted hundreds of organizations worldwide. The says -linked operatives have tried to break into networks using Kubernetes, an open-source tool originally developed by Google to manage cloud services, since at least mid-2019 through early this year. While a ""significant amount"" of the attempted break-ins targeted organizations using Microsoft's Office 365 cloud services, the hackers went after other cloud providers and email servers as well, the said. The U.S. has long accused Russia of using and tolerating cyberattacks for espionage, spreading disinformation, and the disruption of governments and key infrastructure. The Russian Embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday. Joe Slowik, a threat analyst at the network-monitoring firm Gigamon, said the activity described by on Thursday shows the has further streamlined an already popular technique for breaking into networks. He said it appears to overlap with Department of Energy reporting on brute force intrusion attempts in late 2019 and early 2020 targeting the U.S. energy and government sectors and is something the U.S. government has apparently been aware of for some time. , , , Slowik said the use of Kubernetes ""is certainly a bit unique, although on its own it doesn’t appear worrying."" He said the brute force method and lateral movement inside networks described by are common among state-backed hackers and criminal ransomware gangs, allowing the to blend in with other actors. John Hultquist, vice president of analysis at the cybersecurity firm Mandiant, characterized the activity described in the advisory as ""routine collection against policy makers, diplomats, the military, and the defense industry."" ""This is a good reminder that the remains a looming threat, which is especially important given the upcoming Olympics, an event they may well attempt to disrupt,"" Hultquist said in a statement.

""Despite America’s status as the leader of the free world, a champion of human rights, and the largest financial contributor to the system, the authoritarian regimes that rule China, Russia, Iran, and other rogue states increasingly exploit the systems Washington created to maintain a peaceful international order after World War ,"" the report by the Foundation for Defense of Democracies says. The U.S. has been tackling increasing Chinese influence at the U.N. for years, even as it pumps the most money into the institution's various bodies. The Trump administration defunded or pulled out of a number of agencies amid fears they were anti-American and did not advance U.S. interests. The administration pulled out of the World Health Organization over its alleged pro-China bias in its handling of the origins of the -19 pandemic and the Human Rights Council over its controversial membership and alleged anti-Israel bias, and it also pulled money from the U.N. Palestinian refugee agency for anti-Israel bias. The Biden administration has moved to reverse those measures. Nikki Haley, a former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations under then-President Donald Trump who pushed a tough line on China at Turtle Bay, wrote the foreword for the report and warned how other countries are frightened of the communist regime’s growing influence at the body. ""Like Russia, Beijing uses its seat on the Security Council to block justified and moral measures,"" she writes. ""Equally concerning, China is quietly working to corrupt the United Nations from top to bottom. Beijing is pursuing control of virtually every agency.

The report notes how China has grown its influence and won a number of elections in order to dominate a third of U.N. specialized agencies, while picking up a slew of seats on tribunals, councils and other bodies within the U.N. Meanwhile, it accuses Russia of using the border to cover up its non-compliance with international agreements and shielding of Syria and Iran from accountability on bodies like the U.N.

2021-06-30,Fox,https://www.foxnews.com/world/putin-us-britain-black-sea-provocation,Putin: US and Britain both behind Black Sea 'provocation',"Kansas Republican blasts the Biden-Putin summit on 'Your World' Russian President Vladimir Putin said Wednesday that an incident involving a British destroyer in the Black Sea couldn't have triggered a global conflict even if Russia had sunk the warship because the West knows it can't win such a war. The tough statement appeared to indicate his resolve to raise the stakes should a similar incident happen again. Speaking in a marathon call-in show, Putin also revealed that he received the domestically produced Sputnik V coronavirus vaccine and urged Russians to get vaccinated as the country battles a devastating surge of cases and deaths amid widespread hesitancy to get the shot. Putin was asked about the June 23 incident in the Black Sea, in which Russia said one of its warships fired warning shots and a warplane dropped bombs in the path of Britain's Defender to force it from an area near Crimea that Moscow claims as its territorial waters. He said a U.S. reconnaissance aircraft had joined what he described as a ""provocation"" to test Russia's response. , , Britain, which like most other nations didn't recognize Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea, insisted the Defender wasn’t fired upon and said it was sailing in Ukrainian waters. "" Defender was conducting innocent passage through Ukrainian territorial waters in accordance with international law,"" Britain’s Defense Ministry said Wednesday. The U.S. Defense Department had no immediate comment on Putin's claim that a long-range U.S. reconnaissance aircraft that took off from the Greek island of Crete was operating in concert with the British ship. Asked if the events could have triggered a global war, Putin responded that the West wouldn't risk a full-scale conflict. ""Even if we had sunk that ship, it would be hard to imagine that it would put the world on the brink of World War because those who do it know that they can’t emerge as winners in that war, and it’s very important,"" Putin said. The statement followed Russian officials’ warning that if a Western warship enters the waters again, the military could fire on it. Putin charged that the U.S. aircraft’s apparent mission was to monitor the Russian military’s response to the British destroyer. ""It was clearly a provocation, a complex one involving not only the British but also the Americans,"" he said, adding that Moscow was aware of the U.S. intentions and responded accordingly to avoid revealing sensitive data. The Russian leader lamented that the move closely followed his summit with U.S. President Joe Biden in Geneva this month. ""The world is undergoing a radical change,"" he said. ""Our U.S. partners realize that, and that's why the Geneva meeting took place. But on the other hand, they are trying to secure their monopolist stance, resulting in threats and destructive action such as drills, provocations and sanctions."" Russian President Vladimir Putin speaks during a news conference after his meeting with U.S President Joe Biden at the 'Villa la Grange' in Geneva, Switzerland in Geneva, Switzerland, Wednesday, June 16, 2021. , , Even though the West doesn't recognize Crimea as part of Russia, Putin said the naval incident took the controversy to a new level. ""They don't recognize something – , they can keep refusing to recognize it,"" he said. ""But why conduct such provocations?"" Putin insisted Russia would firmly defend its interests. ""We are fighting for ourselves and our future on our own territory,"" he said. ""It's not us who traveled thousands of kilometers to come to them; it's them who have come to our borders and violated our territorial waters."" Dmitri Trenin, the director of the Carnegie Moscow Center, warned that last week's Black Sea incident presages a new, riskier level of confrontation. ""Fresh attempts to expose Russian ‘red line’ deterrence as hollow – whether on the ground, in the air, or at sea – would push Moscow to defend what it cannot give up without losing its self-respect,"" Trenin said in a commentary. ""This would almost inevitably lead to clashes and casualties, which would carry the risk of further escalation. Should this happen, Russia- confrontation would deteriorate literally to the point of brinkmanship, a truly bleak scenario."" Putin on Wednesday also reaffirmed his claim of a close kinship between the Russian and Ukrainian people, but accused Kiev of hostility toward Russia and voiced doubt about the value of a meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, calling him a Western pawn. ""Why meet Zelensky if he has put his country under full foreign control and key issues for Ukraine are decided not in Kiev but in Washington, and, to a certain extent, Paris and Berlin?"" Putin asked. Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba retorted by tweeting that Putin wishes Ukraine's issues were decided in Moscow. ""This is our country and it’s only up to us to decide our fate,"" he added. ‘ ’ Earlier this year, Russia bolstered its forces near Ukraine and warned that Moscow could intervene if Kiev used force to reclaim areas in the east controlled by Russia-backed separatists since a conflict there erupted in 2014. Moscow later pulled back some troops, but Ukrainian authorities said the bulk of them remain close to the border. Putin spent most of the four-hour ""Direct Line"" show discussing domestic issues – typical for the tightly choreographed annual rite that helps him polish his image as a strong leader caring for people's needs. It didn't feature any questions about Russia's beleaguered opposition and Putin's most prominent political foe, Alexei Navalny, who is in prison. He voiced hope the country could avoid a nationwide coronavirus lockdown amid a surge of new infections. Reported deaths in Russia hit a daily record Wednesday, with authorities reporting 669, but Putin said decisions by regional officials to make vaccinations mandatory for some workers should help. Russia has been registering over 20,000 new coronavirus cases and about 600 deaths every day since June 24. On Wednesday, 21,042 new infections were recorded. Russian officials blame the June surge on Russians’ lax attitude toward taking precautions, more infectious variants, and a low rate of vaccinations, which experts attribute to widespread hesitancy to get the shot and limited vaccine production. Although Russia was among the first countries to deploy a vaccine, just over 15% of the population has received at least one shot. Amid this hesitancy, Putin revealed he received the Sputnik V vaccine. Putin got his first shot in late March out of the public eye and has remained tight-lipped about which vaccine he chose. On other issues, Putin said Russia has no intention of banning Western social media platforms but emphasized that the government merely wants them to abide by the law, promptly remove inappropriate content and open offices in Russia.",4,4.623141464019555,4.191665371044524,0.4314760929750303,2

President Biden met with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday. Biden told reporters he gave Putin a list of 16 critical infrastructure entities that are ""off limits"" to a Russian cyberattack.

Schiff said Sunday that Putin has no plausible deniability regarding cybercriminals harbored in Russia. ""It is not credible for him to suggest even if he knew they were operating on his soil that he was powerless to do something about it.

DarkSide, the criminal organization behind the Colonial Pipeline cyberattack, and other high-profile hacking groups bar their partners from installing malicious software on computers using certain languages, according to Krebs on Security, a cybersecurity news site. This has been going on since the early days of organized cybercrime, and ""it is intended to minimize scrutiny and interference from local authorities,"" Krebs wrote as part of a post pointing out that certain malware will not install on a Microsoft Windows computer that has a Russian or Ukrainian virtual keyboard installed. A screenshot of the warning screen from a purported ransomware attack, as captured by a computer user in Taiwan, is seen on laptop in Beijing, Saturday, May 13, 2017. 16 ' ' Cybersecurity company Cybereason noted this back in April when it observed DarkSide being used against targets in English-speaking countries and avoiding targets in countries associated with former Soviet bloc nations. ""When the DarkSide ransomware first executes on the infected host, it checks the language on the system…to avoid systems located in the former Soviet bloc countries from being encrypted,"" according to a report from Cybereason in April. There is a do-not-install list that DarkSide uses based on the language of the software on the victim organization’s computer, according to the post by Cybereason. That includes Russian, Azerbaijani, Uzbek and Ukranian. 10 - : The Photon Research Team at Digital Shadows, a cyber risk protection company, said in a note sent to Fox News that Avaddon ransomware includes a ban on targeting Commonwealth of Independent States countries.

2021-06-18,Fox,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-putin-russian-cyberattacks-list-16-off-limits-criticism,Biden's 'off-limits' list for Russian cyberattacks criticized as 'green light' to target everything else,"'MediaBuzz' host Howard Kurtz weighed in on the tense interaction between the president and a reporter, saying he had 'no reason' to snap at the reporter for what was a 'routine' question. President Biden's list of 16 key infrastructure entities that are ""off-limits"" to Russian cyberattacks has effectively given the Russians a green light to target everything not on that list without facing serious repercussions, national security experts and senior Republicans tell Fox News. Russian cybercriminals are believed to be behind a pair of recent cyberattacks targeting the Colonial Pipeline and meat-processing company Holdings. Both companies paid multi-million dollar ransoms to regain access to their systems. Biden told reporters Wednesday he gave President Vladimir Putin a list of 16 critical infrastructure entities that are ""off limits"" to a Russian cyberattack: ""I talked about the proposition that certain critical infrastructure should be off limits to attack — period — by cyber or any other means. I gave them a list, if I’m not mistaken — I don't have it in front of me — 16 specific entities; 16 defined as critical infrastructure under U.S. policy, from the energy sector to our water systems."" Biden's ""off-limits"" list has led experts and members of Congress to question whether everything not on the list is therefore fair game for attacks. ""As soon as you draw red circles around things you don't want Russia to attack, you're both telling Russia what is most valuable to you and that they can attack anything else without serious consequence,"" Rebecca Heinrichs, a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute, told Fox News. ""It could actually entice Russia to increase attacks against all the other entities besides those 16 things. We should be complicating Russia’s calculations not making them simpler and certainly not essentially green-lighting any kinds of attacks,"" Heinrichs added. ""I'm very circumspect about Biden’s actions in this summit because we're supposed to impose costs when cyberattacks occur and when they meet a level of attribution to a state,"" said Kara Frederick, a research fellow in technology policy at the Heritage Foundation. ""Most cyber criminals in Russia operate with tacit state approval,"" Frederick noted. ""Instead of painting a target on 16 of these things, we should be disrupting their networks,"" she added. Those criticisms were echoed by a long list of Republicans on Capitol Hill, whose reactions to Biden's list ranged from incredulity to anger. Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., told Fox News on Thursday that it appears Biden ""has drawn red lines with Putin that he now must enforce"" and said the president's ""demand"" for Russia to ""cease cyberattacks on only 16 economic sectors was truly bizarre."" ""Together with deciding not to impose sanctions to halt the completion of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, his limited demand on cyberattacks signals weakness that our adversaries will notice and take advantage of,"" said Johnson, who sits on the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee. ""President Biden's summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin confirmed our worst fear: he is too weak to stand up to adversaries,"" Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., told Fox News. ""President Biden effectively gave our adversaries the green light to launch cyberattacks on Americans. All of America should be off limits from Russian-backed cyberattacks, not just the critical infrastructure,"" added Stefanik, who chairs the House Republican Conference. ""President Biden can't help signaling weakness, even by accident,"" Senator Ted Cruz, R-Texas, told Fox News. ""All of America's critical infrastructure is off-limits to Putin."" Oklahoma Sen. James Lankford, a member of the Senate Homeland Security Committee, said that Biden announcing his ""off-limits"" list to the world was ""stunning"" and ""jarring."" ""I think he should have brought a map of the United States and just said, ‘Here's everything you can't attack,’"" Lankford said Thursday on Fox Business' Mornings with Maria. Instead, Lankford said, Biden effectively communicated to the Russians that ""you can attack these other areas."" Texas Rep. August Pfluger, who sits on the House Homeland Security Committee, said that Biden is ""permitting Putin to harbor cybercriminals who are operating indiscriminately within Russia’s border to advance his malign agenda."" ""If our critical infrastructure is to be secured and protected, this must be addressed. I have severe doubts of the effectiveness of handing Putin an ‘off-limits’ list,"" Pfluger continued. ""Energy security is national security, and likewise, the U.S. must protect our agriculture production and food supply."" South Carolina Rep. Ralph Norman, another member of the House Homeland Security Committee, called Biden's list ""an insult to the American people."" The president ""should have made it abundantly clear that the United States will not tolerate cyberattacks of any kind,"" Norman said. ""The tensions on the cyberattack issues were clear; President Biden said, ‘please don’t attack us,’ not ‘here’s what the United States is going to do about this,'"" Florida Rep. Cat Kammack, who also sits on the House Homeland Security Committee, told Fox News. Michigan Rep. Peter Meijer told Fox News that every ""American individual and entity should be off limits from Russian-based hackers,"" adding that America needs ""to use the full weight of our national security apparatus to punish any who attack our country."" ""The 16 -designated sectors are critical to protect, but no area should be left unprotected from cyber-attacks,"" Meijer added. ""This is yet another example of President Biden’s lack of judgment, especially when it comes to dealing with our adversaries,"" Florida Rep. Carlos Gimenez told Fox News. ""The Russians need to know that all Americans are off-limits from their cyber attacks, not just Biden's select few."" ""Instead of submitting a list of 16 off-limit items, President Biden should've made clear that any cyberattack on America is unacceptable and that those responsible will be held to account for their actions. Giving Putin a list was weak,"" Tennessee Rep. Diana Harshbarger told Fox News North Carolina Rep. Dan Bishop similarly said that every piece and sector of American infrastructure ""should be off-limits to cyberattacks."" ""This is not up for debate and President Biden should have made that clear. Weakness on the international stage has severe consequences,"" Bishop added. ""All of America should be protected from Russian hack, and our President should have made it very clear that any Russia-based cyber attack would face immediate response from the United States,"" Rep. Clay Higgins, R-La., told Fox News. ""Instead of drawing a hard line, Biden declared open season on every industry not included in ’s definition of critical infrastructure,"" Higgins added. ""We should not condone any form of Russian aggression against U.S. interests. We should have a policy of zero tolerance."" Rep. Andrew Clyde, R-Ga., told Fox News that Biden's list ""is nothing more than an ornately wrapped present that was hand-delivered to the Kremlin.""

2021-06-15,Fox,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/putin-russia-cyberattacks-defense-intelligence-agency-officer,"Ex-Defense Intelligence Agency Officer: Putin, Russia cyberattacks – get ready, there are many more on the way","Fox News senior foreign affairs correspondent Greg Palkot reports from Windsor. Americans are already contending with the consequences of two major Russian cyberattacks, including gas shortages and price hikes due the Colonial Pipeline hack and potentially rising prices on steak and burgers after the meat processing company was hit. But get ready, because more is on the way. Moscow will likely further escalate its aggression against U.S. interests. U.S. officials, in charge of keeping America safe have not taken the Russian threat seriously enough. Because Russian President Putin’s goal is much bigger than the infliction of a few inconveniences. It is, rather, the unraveling of our society and the weakening of our nation, which Russia views as the primary threat against it. The Kremlin recently declared — with typical intentional ambiguity — its intent to use ""forceful measures,"" including ""coercive use of force,"" ""when necessary,"" against ""unfriendly"" countries. But this almost certainly refers to the United States. The warning came on May 31st from the Head of Russia’s Security Council, Nikolai Patrushev, who in his interview with Russia’s Gazette announced the decision to update Russia’s National Security Strategy. This doctrinal text codifies threats to Russia’s security, as the Kremlin sees them, and provides guidance to the defense establishment on how to counter these threats. Putin will probably approve the new strategy before his June 16 meeting with President Biden, though he may wait to see the outcome of the meeting. '' Patrushev warned that, based on the new strategy, Moscow is justified in using ""symmetric and asymmetric"" measures against ""unfriendly"" countries, in order to deter security threats. Russia has declared its view of the U.S. and as a primary danger to its security in several strategic planning documents, including its military doctrine. President Putin frequently alludes to Russia’s intent to employ an ""asymmetric strategy"" against its adversaries, which would include cyberattacks against the U.S. Putin’s Press Secretary Dmitry Peskov echoed his boss’s sentiment, warning Washington to ""expect uncomfortable signals."" Alarmingly, the Russians have made good on those warnings. Russia believes it is justified in harming the U.S. economy through cyberattacks. The Kremlin thinks the United States, through economic sanctions, set out to undermine the Russian economy and its defense, as well as to turn Russians against Putin’s regime. Moscow’s fears of regime collapse stem from the demise of Russia’s predecessor the and the economic shocks that followed it in the 1990s. ’T ’S ’T A : ‘I ' The United States, although boasting the strongest military in the world, has few responses to the powerful and sophisticated suite of offensive tools Russia terms ""asymmetric."" This arsenal includes disinformation, interference in elections, and of course, cyber strikes, to name a few. Moscow has used cyber to spy and wreak havoc on America’s government, corporate, and military networks. Putin’s strategists view cyber as a powerful weapon, on par with a nuclear strike. A cyber strike, in their view, can produce a similar devastating effect on the adversary’s economy and people’s psychology, causing chaos but without a ""mushroom cloud."" U.S. cyber warriors, on the other hand, have been appropriately hesitant about unleashing America’s mighty cyber fury on Russia, reserving our special toolkit for wartime. Russia has been honing its cyber tools, while gauging America’s responses since the late 1990s. It first launched a multiyear cyber espionage operation, dubbed by investigators Moonlight Maze, against systems in the Pentagon, , weapons labs, and other organizations throughout the United States. Since then, Moscow has penetrated many federal agencies, including the Defense Department, the State Department and the White House. Recent cyberattacks indicate that critical infrastructure, including our gasoline and food supply, remains vulnerable to cyber intrusions more than two decades later. Even our weapon systems have mission-critical cyber vulnerabilities, according to the 2018 Report by the Government Accountability Office. Russia believes Americans are overdependent on digital technology for their daily lives and have low tolerance for the discomfort that cyber disruptions can bring. By attacking critical facilities, like a pipeline or meat processing facility, Moscow believes it can undermine Americans’ support for and confidence in their president. By interfering in our elections, Moscow seeks to foment discord and amplify existing societal tensions. And it doesn’t particularly care which party is in charge, seeking to discredit any U.S. president, whether Republican or Democrat. Moscow wants to keep the confrontation below the threshold of outright war and views cyber as a unique weapon that could help it achieve this goal. Russian intelligence tradecraft includes the use of cyber-criminals and so-called hacktivists to achieve the regime’s goals, in order to maintain plausible deniability. These criminals sometimes work under their handlers’ supervision. This makes attribution of cyberattacks complicated, but the line of responsibility ultimately runs to the Kremlin. Russian planners also developed a nuanced cyber doctrine benignly called ""information confrontation."" It envisions an indefinite non-kinetic conflict — neither peace, nor war — a type of low-intensity warfare that U.S. strategists have termed a ""gray zone conflict."" Many experts worry however, that Russia’s reckless behavior in the cyber domain could escalate into war, even if unintentionally. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark Milley recently warned that competition with Russia could lead to great power conflict. Moscow’s view of cyber as a tool that can destabilize societies is clearly articulated in Russian language military journals, doctrinal writings, leaders’ speeches, and policy documents. The recent cyber sabotage, waged by what President Joe Biden meekly called Russia-based hackers, speaks loudly and clearly. Our national security officials have not been listening. If they want to prevent Russia from achieving its goal of upending civil order in the United States, they’d better start tuning in.",20,3.138605695833103,2.433039336949394,0.7055663588837087,24

Russian President Vladimir Putin pushed back against claims that his government is behind cyberattacks against the U.S. or election interference efforts, claiming that the allegations against Russia are ""farcical"" and lack evidentiary support. In an interview with News, Putin stopped short of a full denial of the allegations, but insisted that the U.S. has not been able to prove anything. ""It’s becoming farcical,"" Putin said. ""We have been accused of all kinds of things. Election interference, cyberattacks, and so on and so forth, and not once – not once, not one time – did they bother to produce any kind of evidence or proof. Just unfounded accusations."" Former special counsel Robert Mueller's report included detailed allegations that the Kremlin-backed Internet Research Agency used fake identities to carry out disinformation campaigns on social media and through grassroots activism. In 2019, the Senate Intelligence Committee released an 85-page report outlining a large-scale Russian effort to interfere in the 2016 presidential election. The group of bipartisan senators described the social media activities of the Internet Research Agency as part of a ""broader, sophisticated and ongoing information warfare campaign designed to sow discord in American politics and society."" In the months before the 2020 elections, Director Christopher Wray said Russia had been ""very active"" in election interference efforts, and a report by cybersecurity firm Digital Shadows released prior to the 2020 election claimed that Russia, Iran and China all posed threats leading into November's contest. The report accused Russia of ""hack and leak"" operations and cooperation between organized crime groups and Russian government agencies. - In this Sept. 23, 2020, file photo, Russian President Vladimir Putin gestures speaks at the Kremlin in Moscow, Russia. Russian hacker Yevgeniy Alexandrovich Nikulin was convicted and sentenced to 88 months in prison for hacking into LinkedIn, Dropbox and former social networking site Formspring, but Nikulin was convicted as a lone actor, not as part of a greater operation by the Russian government. In January, top U.S. national security agencies released a joint statement saying that a months' long cyber attack on software company SolarWinds ""was likely Russian in origin."" Putin was asked by why he does not take a firmer position against individual hackers who attack the U.S., harming diplomatic efforts in the process. Putin responded by saying that ""the simplest thing to do would be for us to sit down calmly and agree on joint work in cyberspace,"" claiming that the U.S. has refused to do so.

Bob Casey, D-Pa., on keeping U.S. infrastructure safe. Senate Sergeant at Arms Karen Gibson said Saturday that she finds the threat of a cyberattack on the U.S. Capitol more worrisome than another repeat of the Jan. 6 assault. ""I worry a lot more about cybersecurity than I do about another mob attacking the Capitol,"" the Senate's chief law enforcement officer for the Senate told . - 16 : Gibson said attempted intrusions on the Capitol networks occur on a daily basis, and with the recent rise in ransomware attacks, cybersecurity has become a greater risk. ""Cybersecurity for me is a much greater concern than the prospect of thousands of people storming the West Terrace,"" she said. ""Members have sensitive information that they would not necessarily want to have disclosed that may be in documents. Much of what we do is public. And meant to be so,"" she explained, adding there is a growing concern foreign adversaries are using nefarious means to cripple the U.S. government. Gibson’s comments come just days after the latest major victim of ransomware, Brazil-based — the world’s largest meat processing company with operations in the U.S. — resumed production after being shuttered for roughly four days. officials attributed the attack to the same Russian criminal group that targeted the East Coast’s Colonial pipeline last month, vil. It remains unclear if paid a ransom, but the attack on the largest U.S. fuel pipeline cost Colonial nearly $4.5 million dollars so the company could regain access to its system. President Biden called for a federal overhaul of the government’s approach to cybersecurity in a May executive order, following the Russia-led Solar Winds attack. The Justice Department also announced earlier this week it is elevating the priority it places on ransomware attacks. The Biden administration has urged the private sector to more heavily invest in countering cybersecurity. ""I've often thought of that as sort of the soft underbelly of America -- the critical infrastructure that's in private sector hands, and may or may not be secured to the extent that we need it to be, as we saw, perhaps, with the Colonial Pipeline ransomware incident. There are many opportunities for those who wish us harm to do so, in a cyber domain,"" Gibson said. ""It's certainly going to keep the cybersecurity staff very busy for the foreseeable future.""

Richard Hudson, R-N.C., argues that President Biden 'needs to' tell Russian President Vladimir Putin to 'stop the hacking, then we will sit down and talk.' The Department of Justice is looking to elevate investigations surrounding ransomware attacks to be on par with how terrorism is prioritized, reports noted Thursday. The recent increase in cyberattacks targeting U.S. interests, including the fallout from the East Coast’s Colonial pipeline hack, have prompted officials to take decisive action, Reuters first reported. A spokesperson told Fox News the department has made it a ""key priority"" to target the ""expediential growth of ransomware."" ""A central goal of the recently launched Ransomware and Digital Extortion Task Force is to ensure we bring to bear the full authorities and resources of the Department in confronting the many dimensions and root causes of this threat,"" Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco wrote in a memo obtained by Fox News Thursday. The cyberattack last month against the largest U.S. fuel pipeline lasted for seven days, causing a spike in gas prices and temporary fuel shortages. Ultimately, Colonial chose to payout $5 million in ransom funds a criminal group based in Russia in order to regain access to their system. Internal guidance sent to U.S. attorney's offices nationwide pointed to the Colonial attack as an example of the ""growing threat that ransomware and digital extortion pose to the nation."" Resident Fellow for American Enterprise Institute Klon Kitchen told Fox News, ""There are often very serious consequences companies are facing."" Kitchen said that had Colonial not paid the $5 million ransom, they could have faced much higher costs as their system remained tied up. - 16 : But the technology and national security-focused fellow explained that paying criminal groups ransom also has its own set of risks. ""You don’t know if the ransomer will unlock what they’ve held hostage, and two, it invites other groups to engage in ransomware activities,"" Kitchen said. Investigators in U.S. attorney offices nationwide will now be required to share details of their investigations with federal authorities.

Michael McCaul, R-Texas, on the latest cyberattack to strike the U.S., calls for Biden to be 'forceful' with response to attack. Top cybersecurity officials warned Wednesday that the U.S. can expect to see more ransomware attacks as the nation reels from recent hits on U.S interests, including meat supplies and fuel. Chris Butera, head of Threat Hunting for the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency , said ransomware has ""continued to increase, especially in our state, local governments, as well as our critical instructor space."" - 16 : ""The ransomware actors have become more brazen,"" he said during a virtual summit hosted by Advanced Technology Academic Research Wednesday. ""They've started to exfiltrate data and try to extort payments."" ""I do think we will continue to see that happen,"" Butera said, adding cybersecurity is a ""primary priority"" for the U.S. government. Ransomware attacks have increasingly targeted American interests, most recently shutting down U.S. meat plants affiliated with the world’s largest meatpacker, Brazil-based , earlier this week. Butera said the government does not encourage companies to pay out ransoms on cyber-attacks but said the administration ""understands"" if private companies disagree. ""The government does not advocate paying ransoms,"" Butera said. ""But we do understand that it is a significant, difficult decision for some of these organizations when they are put under the gun to try to manage their business operations during these times."" The Biden administration’s stance on handling ransomware aligns with the government’s traditional attitude when it comes to paying ransom to any criminal or terrorist group. ""This is a continuation of U.S. policy,"" Resident Fellow for the American Enterprise Institute Klon Kitchen told Fox News. ""We have always encouraged companies not to pay ransom, because it encourages future attacks."" Kitchen pointed to the monumental consequences private companies face when targeted by ransomware, including significant financial loss and potentially devastating shortages for consumers. - But according to Kitchen, there are two major problems that arise once a ransom is paid. There is no guarantee a ransomer will unlock what they are holding hostage once payment is submitted, and the payment sets a precedent that could encourage other groups to engage in ransomware. ""U.S. policy needs to more directly engage with ransomware,"" the technology and national security-focused fellow urged. ""We need to change the political calculus of foreign governments who allow ransomware attackers to operate with impunity within their borders."" The White House has attributed the attacks on and the East Coast’s Colonial pipeline – which struck the largest U.S. fuel pipeline last month – to criminal organizations within Russia. Biden is expected to address the attacks with Russian President Vladimir Putin in the June 16 summit in Geneva, White House officials announced Wednesday. But the president has so far not said the Kremlin has had any affiliation with the ransomware attacks. ""It’s time for the United States to start putting heads on spikes when it comes to confronting and dismantling ransomware groups,"" Kitchen said. ""If President Biden does not confront Vladimir Putin about the ransomware groups perpetrating from within Russia, he will be failing in his duty to protect the United States from these types of attacks,"" he added.

2021-05-13,Fox,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/cyberattacks-america-biden-watch,America under siege on Biden's watch as cyberattackers cripple the country,"'The Five' discuss Biden's economic policy 'disaster' They cut off a pipeline to the Eastern Seaboard for days, tried to poison a Florida water-treatment plant, held hospital systems hostage and stole an undetermined trove of information in the SolarWinds hack – all as the Biden administration searches for a way to respond. Cyberattacks are on the rise, and they’re increasingly targeting major infrastructure installations, like transportation hubs, energy facilities and utility companies. The technology to prevent many of these attacks already exists, experts say, and hacks targeting critical infrastructure, which can threaten American lives, are akin to acts of war. So President Biden signed an executive order Wednesday to strengthen U.S. cyberdefenses and bolster the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, known as . ‘ 21ST ’ ""U.S. public and private sector entities increasingly face sophisticated malicious cyber activity from both nation-state actors and cyber criminals,"" the White House said in a statement. ""These incidents share commonalities, including insufficient cybersecurity defenses that leave public and private sector entities more vulnerable to incidents."" The administration also called on private companies to increase spending on their own cybersecurity, but it stopped short of bolstering offensive capabilities. Biden’s executive actions would likely require federal agencies and contractors to meet minimum cybersecurity protocols – but that doesn’t go nearly far enough, according to former Rep. Denver Riggleman, R-Va., who spent 20 years in intelligence for the military, the National Security Agency and in private industry. ""We need to pick the first country that f---- with us in a cyber way and bring them to their knees,"" he told Fox News Wednesday. His solution is dramatically ramping up spending for offensive cyber capabilities, and then using them disproportionately in response to any future attacks, especially when they are linked to the governments of Russia, China, Iran or North Korea. ""We choose a target that we have access to, and once we identify that target, we take out that target – and we then we [should] take it another step,"" he said. ""If you want to come in and hit the Colonial Pipeline, which only serves several states, we're going to hit your major hub and want to take down half your country for a week."" Nongovernment hackers should be treated like terrorists and squashed as well, he said, because cyberattacks targeting major points of infrastructure have similar effects as terrorism, even if they’re motivated by profit. ""If we had 96 hours with 10 states without gas and power, people would be raiding houses in 72 of those hours,"" Riggleman said. ""The worst cascading effect is the way people react, right? When they don't have power, they don't have water, they don't have energy. It's scary stuff."" Creating that kind of asymmetrical deterrent should pair the increase in cyber offensive spending with funding to modernize the cyberdefenses of U.S. infrastructure, which appears to be glaringly exposed in the wake of numerous recent cyberattacks. ""It's gonna take a flip in resolve, and I would hope that the Biden administration has that resolve,"" he said. For comparison, the Biden administration rolled out new sanctions against Russia after it was implicated in the 2020 SolarWinds hack, which victimized a dozen government agencies, including itself, and about 100 private companies, Microsoft among them. , which is part of the Department of Homeland Security, is slated to receive $2 billion of the department’s $60 billion budget, Riggleman said. And only about $6 million of that goes to incident response. Even without increasing ’s budget, Riggleman said lawmakers on both sides of the aisle need to unite to protect America from its enemies. One way to infuse tens of millions of dollars into the agency immediately, he proposed, would be to redirect funding from nonessential programs, such as if there was $25 million slated for teaching elementary schools how to use computers. ""I think what you need to do is an audit – and if you see things that look ridiculous, we have to come to a point where mission-specific objectives override political objectives as some might define as woke or whatever,"" he said. And there’s no excuse for critical infrastructure facilities that feel the need to have armed guards, locked gates and secured perimeters to overlook their cybersecurity, according to Lior Frenkel, and co-founder of Waterfall Security Solutions. Speaking over the phone from Israel, he told Fox News Wednesday that his company and its competitors already have thousands of facilities in the U.S. and abroad protected by its technology, which thwarts Trojan horse-style ransomware attacks. The solution, he told Fox News Wednesday, is to lock down the direction in which information flows. ""Water can't go up the waterfall – given there's a physical barrier, which is exactly what we do,"" he said. But water, like encrypted data, can still go down, allowing infrastructure facilities to send out information freely to the cloud without being at risk of a cyberattack in the opposite direction. Frenkel said his company serves thousands of infrastructure clients already, about half of them in the energy sector and more in water, chemicals and transportation. : ‘ ’ ""I founded this company because it drives me crazy that it’s so easy to penetrate, remotely, such critical systems that have such a big impact on society – and yet it’s so hard physically,"" he said. ""You have armed guards and security all around it. … But you can hack through the firewall and you're in and can do practically whatever you want."" Biden's Wednesday executive order made no mention of bolstering the United States' offensive cyber capabilities, but it did establish a national Cybersecurity Safety Review Board to investigate future major incidents. The White House did not immediately respond to a Fox News request for comment. As Republicans and Democrats try to negotiate what could be a multitrillion-dollar infrastructure deal in Washington, D.C., experts say whatever they agree upon should acknowledge cybersecurity in all critical new infrastructure projects.",20,1.6283829409429826,5.484011142212233,-3.8556282012692504,24

""In December of 2017, I made which now is kind of the fateful trip to Moscow,"" explained Marc Polymeropolous, a 26 year veteran of the , who was forced to retire as the ’s official for clandestine operations in Europe after suffering a mysterious traumatic brain injury and debilitating side effects following a trip to Moscow in 2017. ""I woke up in the middle of the night with an incredible case of vertigo, of tinnitus, which is ringing in the ears. I was falling over. I was nauseated,"" Polymeropolous said in an interview with Fox News. ""There was no mistake that something really, really terrifying happened that night in Moscow. I had been in Afghanistan. I spent time in Iraq. This was the most terrifying experience of my life."" The veteran officer was staying at the Marriott Hotel near the Embassy when he was attacked. His case resembles symptoms described by 40 diplomats in Havana serving at the Embassy and a dozen diplomats serving in China who in 2016 began experiencing extreme vertigo and nausea, sometimes following a loud, piercing sound that experts now believe was the result of directed radiofrequency energy in the form of a microwave. '' Senators Mark Warner and Marco Rubio, the top Republican and Democrats heading the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, issued a stern statement acknowledging for the first time officials had been ""attacked,"" suggesting the attacks are ongoing and ""increasing."" Now two cases are being investigated on U.S. soil, including one that allegedly took place last year near the ellipse outside the White House and another that targeted a National Security Council official. Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire has pressed the State Department and intelligence community for years about the alleged attacks on diplomats. In a heated exchange with Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines, she referenced open source reporting of the incident outside the White House. ""One of the incidents described here happened on the ellipse in late 2020. And that's very close to the White House,"" Senator Shaheen said to Haines. : – 'S David Relman of Stanford led the National Academy of Sciences study requested by the State Department which until recently remained classified. The report concluded these diplomats had been targeted by a pulsed radiofrequency. ""A form of microwave energy that we don't typically see in the world around us. It's not the continuous wave energy that comes out of our cell phones or out of our microwaves. It's not that,"" Relman explained. ""It is a high energy, very short delivery of this microwave energy. It's a form that isn't common in the world around us, but is used, for example, by militaries for radar."" The ’s Polymeropolous described the brain fog and loss of long-distance vision. ""It became pretty clear that something pretty terrible happened."" : 'S At first, he says, when he raised the issue with doctors at the , few believed him. He says he is now getting more support from the new director of , William Burns, who promised to help at the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence during the Annual Threat Assessment hearing: ""I said in my confirmation hearing before the Senate that I would make this a very high priority to ensure that my colleagues get the care that they deserve and that we get to the bottom of what caused these incidents and who was responsible. And, I've tried very hard in the three weeks now that I've been at to demonstrate that commitment. I've visited Walter Reed and to thank the wonderful professionals there for the support they've provided."" After facing frustrating bureaucracy for 3 years, Polymeropolous is finally getting treated at Walter Reed’s National Intrepid Center of Excellence, which specializes in traumatic brain injuries. ""There's conventional wisdom that this is a portable weapon, a microwave weapon that we knew the Soviet Union and the Russians certainly developed and tested for a long time. And it's designed to incapacitate. I mean, it's pretty insidious because it also doesn't leave any kind of open scars or wounds,"" Polymeropolous said. ""It's a terror weapon that I think the Russians, in my view, have employed. And they've done so to very good effect because it's caused a great deal of worry and fear among the diplomatic community. The majority of senior government officials, including the intelligence community, believe it's the Russians,"" he said. Now lawmakers on both sides of the aisle want answers from the , State Department, Pentagon and about who is responsible for these attacks that the Senate Select Intelligence Committee says are ongoing and increasing. Senator James Inhofe , the top Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee, recently confirmed he had received a classified briefing but would not divulge any details. ""There’s some confidential things that we are not going to be talking about and that’s one of them,"" he said. Senator Richard Blumenthal also confirmed the briefing.

In this Feb. 4, 2021 file photo, Secretary of State Antony Blinken speaks at the State Department in Washington.

He will meet with Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky during that time, as well. Blinken told ""60 Minutes"" that there are ""more forces amassed on the border with Ukraine than any time since 2014.""

""There are any number of things that he could do or choose not to do."" , - ""What we have seen in the last few days is apparently a decision to pull back some of those forces and we've seen some of them in fact start to pull back,"" he added. The State Department did not return Fox News' request for comment.

He told them to leave their weapons behind for another exercise later this year. ""I consider the goals of the snap check of readiness fulfilled,"" Shoigu said. ""The troops have shown their capability to defend the country and I decided to complete the drills in the South and Western military districts."" Yuval Weber, an expert on Russia and Eurasia at Texas A&M’s Bush School of Government and Public Service, said that the decision to leave the weapons behind was a clear parallel to Moscow’s preparations prior to an offensive with Georgia in 2008.

The maneuvers were described as the largest since Russia annexed Ukraine's Black Sea peninsula in 2014 and threw its weight behind separatist insurgents in eastern Ukraine. The Russian troop buildup near Ukraine that came amid increasing violations of a cease-fire in Ukraine's east has raised concerns in the West, which urged the Kremlin to pull its forces back. The U.S. and have said that the Russian buildup near Ukraine was the largest since 2014, when Russia annexed Crimea and threw its support behind separatists in Ukraine’s eastern industrial heartland called Donbas. Ukraine’s president said the Russian troops’ pullback will help ease tensions and thanked international partners for their support. ""The reduction of troops on our border proportionally reduces tension,"" Zelenskyy said on Twitter. He noted that Ukraine remains vigilant, but ""welcomes any steps to decrease the military presence and deescalate the situation in Donbas."" Earlier this week, Zelenskyy offered Russian President Vladimir Putin to meet in Donbas to defuse tensions. 'S A ' ': ' Putin responded in televised remarks Thursday, saying that if the Ukrainian leadership wants to settle the conflict in Donbas, it should first engage in talks with separatist leaders in the east and only after that discuss it with Russia. If Zelenskyy wants to discuss normalizing ties with Russia, he's welcome to come to Moscow, the Russian leader said. The Russian military hasn’t reported the number of additional troops that have been moved to Crimea and parts of southwestern Russia near Ukraine, and it wasn’t immediately clear from Shoigu’s statement if all of them will now be pulled back. The Russian Defense Ministry said the maneuvers in Crimea involved more than 60 ships, over 10,000 troops, around 200 aircraft and about 1,200 military vehicles. The exercise featured the landing of more than 2,000 paratroopers and 60 military vehicles on Thursday. Fighter jets covered the airborne operation. Shoigu flew in a helicopter over the Opuk firing range in Crimea to oversee the exercise. He later declared the drills over, but ordered the military to stand ready to respond to any ""adverse developments"" during 's Defender Europe 2021 exercise.

Last week, Russia has announced that it would close broad areas of the Black Sea near Crimea to foreign navy ships and state vessels until November, a move that drew Ukrainian protests and raised Western concerns. Russia also announced restrictions on flights near Crimea this week, arguing that they fully conform with the international law. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba warned Tuesday that the Russian buildup across the border is continuing and is ""expected to reach a combined force of over 120,000 troops"" in about a week and urged the West to beef up sanctions against Moscow. Moscow has rejected Ukrainian and Western concerns about the buildup, arguing that it's free to deploy its forces anywhere on the Russian territory and charging that they don't threaten anyone.

The warning during Putin’s annual state-of-the-nation address came amid a massive Russian military buildup near Ukraine, where cease-fire violations in the seven-year conflict between Russia-backed separatists and Ukrainian forces have escalated in recent weeks. The United States and its allies have urged the Kremlin to pull the troops back. ""I hope that no one dares to cross the red line in respect to Russia, and we will determine where it is in each specific case,"" Putin said. ""Those who organize any provocations threatening our core security interests will regret their deeds more than they regretted anything for a long time."" Moscow has rejected Ukrainian and Western concerns about the troop buildup, saying it doesn’t threaten anyone and that Russia is free to deploy its forces on its territory. But the Kremlin also has warned Ukraine against trying to use force to retake control of the rebel-held east, saying Russia could be forced to intervene to protect civilians in the region. ""We really don’t want to burn the bridges,"" Putin said. ""But if some mistake our good intentions for indifference or weakness and intend to burn or even blow up those bridges themselves, Russia’s response will be asymmetrical, quick and tough."" As Putin spoke, a wave of protests started rolling across Russia in support of imprisoned opposition leader Alexei Navalny, and a human rights group said nearly 1,500 people were arrested. Thousands marched in central Moscow, where police blocked off a square next to the Kremlin. Police in St. Petersburg blocked off Palace Square, outside the Hermitage museum, and protesters instead massed along Nevsky Prospekt. The politician, who is Putin’s most persistent critic and was poisoned with a chemical nerve agent last year, started a hunger strike three weeks ago to protest what he said was inadequate medical treatment and officials’ refusal to allow his doctor to visit him. His supporters called the rallies as his health reportedly is in severe decline. In his speech, Putin pointed to Russia’s moves to modernize its nuclear arsenal and said the military would continue to build more state-of-the-art hypersonic missiles and other new weapons. He added that the development of the nuclear-armed Poseidon underwater drone and the Burevestnik nuclear-powered cruise missile is continuing successfully. In an apparent reference to the U.S. and its allies, the Russian leader denounced those who impose ""unlawful, politically motivated economic sanctions and crude attempts to enforce its will on others."" He said Russia has shown restraint and often refrained from responding to ""openly boorish"" actions by others. : The Biden administration last week imposed new sanctions on Russia for interfering in the 2020 U.S. presidential election and for involvement in the SolarWind hack of federal agencies — activities Moscow has denied. The U.S. ordered 10 Russian diplomats expelled, targeted dozens of companies and individuals, and imposed new curbs on Russia’s ability to borrow money. Russia retaliated by ordering 10 U.S. diplomats to leave, blacklisting eight current and former U.S. officials, and tightening requirements for U.S. Embassy operations. ""Russia has its own interests, which we will defend in line with the international law,"" Putin said during Wednesday’s address. ""If somebody refuses to understand this obvious thing, is reluctant to conduct a dialogue and chooses a selfish and arrogant tone, Russia will always find a way to defend its position."" In an emotional outburst, Putin chastised the West for acquiring a defiant stance toward Russia. ""Some countries have developed a nasty habit of bullying Russia for any reason or without any reason at all. It has become a new sport,"" he said. In an apparent reference to the U.S. allies, he compared them to Tabaqui, a cowardly golden jackal kowtowing to Shere Khan, the tiger in Rudyard Kipling’s ""Jungle Book."" ""They howl to please their lord,"" he said. Russia this week engaged in a tense tug-of-war with the Czech Republic, following Prague’s move to expel 18 Russian diplomats over a massive Czech ammunition depot explosion in 2014. Moscow has dismissed the Czech accusations of its involvement in the blast as absurd and retaliated by expelling 20 Czech diplomats. Putin also harshly criticized the West for failing to condemn what he described as a botched coup attempt and a failed plot to assassinate Belarus’ President Alexander Lukashenko, allegedly involving a blockade of the country’s capital, power cuts and cyberattacks. Belarusian and Russian security agencies arrested the alleged coup plotters in Moscow earlier this month. ""The practice of organizing coups and planning political assassinations of top officials goes over the top and crosses all boundaries,"" Putin said, drawing parallels to plots against Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and the popular protests that led to the ouster of Ukraine’s former Russia-friendly president, Viktor Yanukovych, in 2014. Russia responded to Yanukovych’s ouster by annexing Ukraine’s Crimean Peninsula and throwing its support to the separatists in the country’s east. Since then, fighting there has killed more than 14,000 people and devastated the industrial heartland. Putin dedicated most of his annual address to domestic issues, hailing the nation’s response to the coronavirus pandemic. He said the quick development of three coronavirus vaccines underlined Russia’s technological and industrial potential. He called for a quicker pace of immunizations, voicing hope the country could achieve collective immunity this fall.",4,4.270530148926297,4.62101553840886,-0.3504853894825626,7

Jack Keane reacts to U.S. intelligence backpedaling on last summer's reports of Russia placing bounties on the heads of U.S. soldiers. U.S. intelligence backpedaled Thursday on last summer's reports of Russia placing bounties on the heads of U.S. soldiers. A senior Biden administration official said the intelligence community only had ""low to moderate"" confidence in the Russian bounty story, meaning it is unproven and possibly untrue. The revelation came just as President Biden declared the Russia threat a ""national emergency"" and slapped new sanctions on Russian officials. The sanctions had been a result of meddling in the 2020 election, Russia's alleged role in the SolarWinds hack and the poisoning of Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny. ""The United States intelligence community assesses with low to moderate confidence that Russian intelligence officers sought to encourage Taliban attacks against U.S. and coalition personnel in Afghanistan in 2019, and perhaps earlier, including through financial incentives and compensation,"" the official said. ""U.S. intelligence community agencies have low to moderate confidence in this judgment in part because it relies on detainee reporting, and due to the challenging operating environment in Afghanistan, our conclusion is based on information and evidence of connections between criminal agents in Afghanistan and elements of the Russian government,"" the official continued. The Russian bounty story, first reported by the New York Times, ignited outrage during the heat of the 2020 election. President Trump repeatedly had cast doubt on the validity of the story that Russian officials had offered to pay Taliban fighters to kill American soldiers, calling it a ""hoax."" Trump said he had not been briefed on the story before it was made public by the Times, as intelligence found ""no consensus"" on the matter. ' ' ""The Russia Bounty story is just another made up by Fake News tale that is told only to damage me and the Republican Party,"" Trump tweeted last July. ""The secret source probably does not even exist, just like the story itself."" Trump called on the Times to reveal their source, claiming the story was ""Just another !"" Lawmakers, both Republicans and Democrats, demanded the Trump administration explain what it knew after the report broke. Then-candidate Biden had accused Trump of a ""dereliction of duty"" for not responding adequately to the report. Asked if Biden now regrets attacking Trump over the bounty story, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said she was ""not going to speak to the previous administration,"" but reiterated there was ""enough concern"" to merit having intel ""truly look into it.""

Now, Biden's campaign's comments where he used the story as a talking point against Trump are resurfacing. ""The truly shocking revelation … if the Times report is true, and I emphasize that again, is that President Trump, the commander in chief of American troops serving in a dangerous theater of war, has known about this for months, according to the Times, and done worse than nothing,"" Biden, then the presumptive Democratic nominee, said in a town hall last June.

Unfortunately, there are probably some people in the government who didn't like Donald Trump, wanted to help Joe Biden get elected, and they selectively leaked it without providing the proper context to it. … No one should ever leak classified information. That's a very dangerous thing to get into, and the government needs to take more steps to try to ensure that, on the one hand, people who leak classified information are being punished, but also that classified information truly is classified.

Jack Keane reacts to U.S. intelligence backpedaling on last summer's reports of Russia placing bounties on the heads of U.S. soldiers. In yet another example of a dramatic mainstream media narrative imploding, the intelligence community has backed off reports that Russia placed bounties on the heads of U.S. soldiers in Afghanistan. A senior Biden administration official said Thursday the intelligence community only had ""low to moderate"" confidence in the Russian bounty story, meaning it is unproven and possibly untrue, due to a reliance on ""detainee reporting."" The revelation came as the administration announced a new series of sanctions against Russia for a host of reasons, but the bounty story was not among them. In a press that already fixated on Russia collusion accusations since 2016, the story went wild last year, and critics are furious over another example of legacy press outlets corroborating one another on an anonymously sourced story that turned out to be, at best, doubtful. A '' ""What happened here?"" Fourth Watch newsletter's Steve Krakauer wrote. ""Well I think we know. There are only two explanations - either the media got spun bad information from its intelligence sources, or it got the story being fed from the intelligence sources wrong. Either way, it's a bad look."" A New York Times report last June said American intelligence ""concluded that a Russian military intelligence unit secretly offered bounties to Taliban-linked militants for killing coalition forces in Afghanistan,"" amid peace talks to end the war there. Former President Donald Trump and some officials pushed back on the story at the time as an unverified rumor, but that only fueled media narrative that the Trump administration was in Russia's pocket and hanging troops out to dry. A senior U.S. official who has been briefed on the matter told Fox News last summer that the information that the National Security Council had received was based on ""several streams of intelligence of concern"" with some of it being contradictory and some open to interpretation. Former White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany reminded Twitter followers she said the intelligence was ""not verified"" at the time, although then-Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said he confronted Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov last year and told him Moscow would have a price to pay if the story was true. . : '' ""I'm glad this day of accounting has come,"" McEnany said Friday on ""Outnumbered.""

In one story, called the story ""richly reported."" 's Rachel Maddow, a leading proponent of Russia-related conspiracy theories during the Trump era, passed the story along as true to her viewers, calling it a whole new level of ""bad."" Joy Reid, another host known for disseminating conspiracy theories, also accepted the story without question. The Daily Caller compiled a montage of pundits and news anchors breathlessly sharing the news, often without noting it was ""alleged."" One chyron under left-wing host Lawrence O'Donnell read, ""Lawmakers demand answers re: Russian bounties to kill U.S. troops."" ""Americans found out this weekend that Vladimir Putin is paying to put bounties on the heads of American troops,"" 's Joe Scarborough said at one point. -'S : ' ' As the story broke in the middle of the 2020 presidential election fight, it had political consequences as well. Then-candidate Joe Biden blasted Trump for saying there was low confidence in the intelligence and continuing to have calls with Russian President Vladimir Putin, and Kamala Harris even brought up the story during her vice-presidential debate with Mike Pence. Numerous other Democrats also used the story to go on the attack, including Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Democratic Reps.

The Washington Post is standing by a ""Four Pinocchios"" fact-check rating it gave then-President Donald Trump last year, even after U.S. intelligence backed away from reports that Russia placed bounties on the heads of American soldiers in Afghanistan. A senior Biden administration official said Thursday the intelligence community only had ""low to moderate"" confidence in the report, meaning it was unproven and possibly untrue, due to a reliance on ""detainee reporting."" The revelation came as Biden announced a new series of sanctions against Russia. The alleged bounties were not among the reasons cited as justification for the sanctions. In July, a Post fact-check challenged Trump's attempt to downplay the Russian bounty narrative after the story was first reported by The New York Times. ""It’s been widely reported that the U.S. has intelligence indicating that Russia paid bounties, or offered to pay bounties, to Taliban fighters to kill American soldiers. You had a phone call with Vladimir Putin on July 23rd. Did you bring up this issue?"" Axios reporter Jonathan Swan asked Trump an interview that aired on Aug. 3. : ' ' ""No, that was a phone call to discuss other things, and frankly, that’s an issue that many people said was fake news,"" answered Trump, who denied he had been briefed on the matter despite pushback from Swan. ""It never reached my desk. You know why? Because they didn’t think it — intelligence — they didn’t think it was real."" At the time, the Post wrote under ""The Facts"" that ""White House officials were first informed in early 2019 of intelligence reports that Russia was offering bounties to Taliban-linked militants to kill U.S. and allied military personnel in Afghanistan, but the information at the time was deemed sketchy and in need of additional confirmation, sources previously told The Washington Post."" ""There’s an issue with the intelligence, which we discuss above, and then there’s an issue with Trump flat-out denying instead of engaging with reality. Assessments of the U.S. intelligence on Russian bounties may be mixed, but that doesn’t make it 'fake news,'"" the Post ruled. ""Reports of Russian bounties targeting U.S. troops have spurred the Defense Department to action, triggered a leak investigation by the Justice Department and continue to be investigated by U.S. officials.

""Our analysis and Pinocchio rating are unchanged.

Jack Keane reacts to U.S. intelligence backpedaling on last summer's reports of Russia placing bounties on the heads of U.S. soldiers. Vice President Harris cited the now-backpedaled report of Russia placing bounties on the heads of U.S. soldiers during a general election debate in October with former Vice President Mike Pence. A senior Biden administration official this week said the intelligence community only had ""low to moderate"" confidence in the Russian bounty story. ""The United States intelligence community assesses with low to moderate confidence that Russian intelligence officers sought to encourage Taliban attacks against U.S. and coalition personnel in Afghanistan in 2019, and perhaps earlier, including through financial incentives and compensation,"" the official said. ""U.S. intelligence community agencies have low to moderate confidence in this judgment in part because it relies on detainee reporting, and due to the challenging operating environment in Afghanistan, our conclusion is based on information and evidence of connections between criminal agents in Afghanistan and elements of the Russian government,"" the official continued. But during the debate in October Harris cited the reports, which then-President Trump referred to as a ""hoax."" ""Public reporting that Russia had bounties on the heads of American soldiers, and you know what a bounty is?"" Harris said, when responding to a question about American leadership. ""Somebody puts a price on your head, and they will pay it if you are killed. And Donald Trump has talked at least six times to Vladmir Putin, and never brought up the subject."" Harris added: ""Joe Biden would never do that."" ""Joe Biden – Joe Biden would hold Russia to account for any threat to our nation's security or to our troops who are sacrificing their lives for the sake of our democracy and our safety,"" Harris said during the debate. Biden, this week, declared the Russia threat a ""national emergency"" and slapped new sanctions on Russian officials. The sanctions came after U.S. intelligence found Russian attempts to interfere in the 2020 election, and after Russia’s alleged role in the SolarWinds hack, as well as the poisoning of Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny. The Russian bounty story, first reported by The New York Times, ignited outrage during the heat of the 2020 campaign. President Trump repeatedly cast doubt on the validity of the story and said he had not been briefed on the story before it was made public by the Times, as intelligence found ""no consensus"" on the matter. ' ' ""The Russia Bounty story is just another made up by Fake News tale that is told only to damage me and the Republican Party,"" Trump tweeted last July. ""The secret source probably does not even exist, just like the story itself."" Trump called on the Times to reveal their source, claiming the story was ""Just another !"" Lawmakers, both Republicans and Democrats, demanded the Trump administration explain what it knew after the report broke. Then-candidate Biden had accused Trump of a ""dereliction of duty"" for not responding adequately to the report. Asked if Biden now regrets attacking Trump over the bounty story, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said she was ""not going to speak to the previous administration,"" but reiterated there was ""enough concern"" to merit having intel ""truly look into it.""

The White House said this week it did not have sufficient evidence to support a report repeatedly mentioned by some Democrats, like Sen. Tammy Duckworth, D-Ill., who alleged that Russian agents had offered bounties to the Taliban to attack U.S troops in Afghanistan – and that President Donald Trump did nothing about it. On Thursday, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said that after a review of classified reports, the intelligence community determined it had only ""low to moderate confidence"" in their authenticity. She said that was due in part to the ways in which the intelligence was obtained, including from interrogations of Afghan detainees. The Trump White House was said to have been briefed on the reports of offered bounties. Some Democrats used that information against the former president as evidence of his cozy relationship with Putin and framed it as a failure to protect U.S. troops. ’S Duckworth, who is a combat veteran, tweeted dozens of times about the former president’s alleged unwillingness to confront Putin. She also called for a hearing, introduced legislation, used the hashtag ""#BountyGate"" and gave a speech to fellow lawmakers. A spokesperson for the senator did not return Fox News’ request for comment on the latest details about the report from the Biden White House. There has always been doubt within the intelligence community about the report. Then-national security adviser Robert O’Brien said Trump himself had not been briefed on the matter because the intelligence reports ""have not been verified."" U.S. military commanders at the time also said the raw intelligence did not lead them to change their force protection posture in Afghanistan. Trump tweeted over the summer that he had not been briefed because the information was not found credible, and floated the idea that it was a ""hoax."" In September, Gen. Frank McKenzie, commander of the U.S. Central Command, told News that the existence of bounties hadn’t not been proven ""to a level"" that satisfied him. ""We continue to look for that evidence,"" the general told the outlet. ""I just haven't seen it yet. But … it's not a closed issue."" Defense officials have said they also did not believe the said bounties had led to any American deaths. Duckworth, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, continued to harp on the issue regardless. In March she pushed for information pertaining to the reports to be declassified, while claiming service members deserved to know if Trump ""truly did nothing"" if bounties were placed on the heads of military members. She also praised President Biden for calling out Russian President Vladimir Putin on the issue ""at first opportunity."" Biden did raise the issue with Putin in January.

Federal investigators found no evidence that foreign powers ""manipulated any election results"" in the 2020 presidential race, the Biden administration announced Tuesday – but foreign powers did try to influence public opinion for their favored candidates. The U.S. Office of the Director of National Intelligence released a declassified intelligence assessment of foreign threats to the 2020 elections pursuant to the Intelligence Authorization Act. 'S ' ' A joint investigation involving the Departments of Justice and Homeland Security, as well as the and Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, found Russia and Iran sought to attack then-candidate Biden and former President Trump, respectively, and China prepared an influence plan that it did not act upon. The Biden administration is reportedly considering sanctions on Russia, China and Iran as a result of the findings of the new report. - In this combination of file photos, former Vice President Joe Biden speaks in Wilmington, Del., on March 12, 2020, left, and President Donald Trump speaks at the White House in Washington on April 5, 2020. Barring unforeseen disaster, Biden will represent the Democratic Party against Trump this fall, the former vice president's place on the general election ballot cemented Wednesday, April 8, by Bernie Sanders' decision to end his campaign. Vote totals themselves were not affected – even though investigators uncovered intrusions into state and local networks -- according to the assessment. ""The Departments investigated multiple public claims that one or more foreign governments owned, directed or controlled election infrastructure used in the 2020 federal elections; implemented a scheme to manipulate election infrastructure; or tallied, changed or otherwise manipulated vote counts,"" the and said in a joint statement. ""The Departments found that those claims were not credible."" , The declassified report also concluded that Russian President Vladimir Putin personally authorized ""influence operations"" attacking then-candidate Biden and other Democrats as well as stoking partisan division in the U.S. Those measures included amplifying allegations of corruption linked to Biden, his family and Ukraine. At the same time, Iran’s Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei likely authorized an operation targeting President Trump, secretly trying ""to undercut"" his reelection campaign and, like Russia, also trying to fuel partisan tensions. Additionally, Iran impersonated members of the Proud Boys to send threatening emails to voters in multiple states, according to the assessment. China had considered its own efforts but ultimately held back, according to the report, possibly because officials there did not believe either candidate would be more pro-Beijing. And three lesser threats – Hezbollah, Cuba and Venezuela – made small-scale attacks. ""This report highlights the ongoing and persistent efforts by our adversaries to influence our elections, which all Americans should be informed about,"" Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Mark Warner, D-Va., said in a statement. ""Russia, in particular, has expended real effort, not just in 2020, but also as we all recall in 2016, to influence election results."" Warner said that he believes U.S. intelligence officials have improved their abilities to detect and counter such efforts, however. ""But the problem of foreign actors trying to influence the American electorate is not going away and, given the current partisan divides in this country, may find fertile ground in which to grow in the future,"" he added.",20,3.373708383096042,3.008357629675071,0.36535075342097123,17

The extent of the damage was unclear. ' ' The department said that 3% of its Microsoft Office 365 email accounts were potentially affected, but did not say to whom those accounts belonged. There are no indications that classified systems were affected, the agency said. Office 365 isn't just email but a collaborative computing environment, which means that shared documents were also surely accessed, said Dmitri Alperovitch, former chief technical officer of the cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike. Separately, the Administrative Office of U.S. Courts informed federal judicial bodies across the nation that the courts’ nationwide case management system was breached. That potentially gave the hackers access to sealed court documents, whose contents are highly sensitive. 'S : The Justice Department said that on Dec. 24 it detected ""previously unknown malicious activity"" linked to the broader intrusions of federal agencies revealed earlier that month, according to a statement from spokesman Marc Raimondi. Separately, the court office said on its website that ""an apparent compromise"" of the U.S. judiciary's case management and electronic case file system was under investigation. : ' ' The Department of Homeland Security was scouring the system, it said, and cited a particular risk to sealed court filings, whose disclosure could jeopardize a lot more than active criminal investigations. ""The potential reach is vast. The actual reach is probably significant,"" said a federal court official who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to disclose the information. The official confirmed that the scope of the compromise was national but it was not clear how widespread. The sealed court files, if indeed breached, could hold information about national security, trade secrets and wiretap transcripts, along with financial data from bankruptcy cases and the names of confidential informants in criminal cases, the official added. ? A On Tuesday, federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies formally implicated Russia in the intrusions, calling them part of a suspected intelligence-gathering operation. President Donald Trump had previously questioned that consensus, suggesting without foundation that China could be to blame. The hacking campaign was extraordinary in scale, with the intruders stalking through government agencies including the Treasury and Commerce departments, defense contractors and telecommunications companies for months by the time the breach was discovered. Experts say that gave the foreign agents ample time to collect data that could be highly damaging to U.S. national security, although the scope of the breaches and exactly what information was sought is unknown. An estimated 18,000 organizations were seeded with malicious code that piggybacked on popular network-management software from an Austin, Texas, company called SolarWinds. But only a subset are believed to have been compromised. Tuesday's statement said that fewer than 10 federal government agencies have so far been identified as having been hacked. Johns Hopkins cyberespionage expert Thomas Rid said the 3% figure of email accounts accessed at Justice may not sound like a lot, but that it doesn’t mean that the hackers ""didn’t get to the interesting stuff."" Cybersecurity experts responding to the hack say highly skilled cyberspies of the caliber behind the SolarWinds hack are apt to keep their footprint as small as possible to avoid detection — targeting only high-value email and documents. Rid wondered how sure the Justice Department could be about the extent of its compromise. ""How good is their own visibility given that U.S. government agencies totally missed the breach in the first place?"" he said. ""Are they really on top of the problem? Are we only really seeing the tip of the iceberg?"" The breach was discovered by FireEye, a prominent cybersecurity company, on its network. It then identified and notified other victims. 6 , Experts expect the severity of the hack and the number of victims identified to increase over time. ""History tells us that if you have a large breach, not just in one organization but across an entire government — an entire sector — it will take a long time to identify who are the victims and how badly they are compromised,"" said Rid. Microsoft declined to comment on long the intruders were reading emails in the Justice Department's Office 365 environment, which is typically a cloud-based service hosted by the software provider.",20,3.665333663981197,1.75985906475109,1.905474599230107,13

The statement represented the U.S. government's first formal attempt to assign responsibility for the breaches at multiple agencies and to assign a possible motive for the operation. The agencies rejected President Trump's claim that China might be to blame. The seal is seen before a news conference at headquarters in Washington. The agencies said the hacks appeared to be part of ""intelligence-gathering,"" suggesting the evidence so far pointed to a Russian spying effort, rather than an attempt to damage or disrupt U.S. government operations. ""This work indicates that an Advanced Persistent Threat actor, likely Russian in origin, is responsible for most or all of the recently discovered, ongoing cyber compromises of both government and non-governmental networks,"" the statement read.

But Trump, in a series of tweets late last month, sought to downplay the severity of the hack and raised the unsubstantiated idea that China could be responsible.

""We are still doing the forensics. We don’t even know how bad this is,"" he said. ""We are supposed to detect these threats… and preempt them before they cause harm.""

Last week, both Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, and Attorney General Bill Barr pointed to Russia when asked about the source of the attack. Pompeo who was the director of before becoming the Secretary of State, became the first member of the Trump administration to put blame on Russia last Friday in an interview on ""The Mark Levin Show.""

""We've come to recognize that the president has a blind spot when it comes to Russia,"" he said. Fox News reported earlier this week, in a sign of the severity of the attack, the president’s National Security Adviser Robert O’Brien returned earlier from his trip to Europe to coordinate the government’s response. ""Some issues are too sensitive to discuss,"" he said on Christmas Eve when asked about the details of the operation. , - 'S President-elect Joe Biden called Trump’s response ""irrational"" blaming the administration for failing ""to prioritize cybersecurity."" Biden, who will take office in less than a month, added, ""This attack constitutes a grave risk to our national security."" Former chief Hoffman said this will be one of the issues the incoming administration will have to handle with great care. ""Every single nominee who testifies for a position in the intelligence community in the Biden administration is going to be asked this question,"" he said when describing how the U.S. administration will respond eventually. Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle are now asking for a more comprehensive policy against Russia. Sen.

Experts say the consequences will not be limited to a targeted response in cyberspace. Anna Borshchevskaya, a senior fellow at the Washington Institute, says the U.S. shifted foreign policy priority to China in recent years as Russia is now seen as a declining power and cannot really pose a serious threat. ""This cyberattack once again highlights that this vision is wrong. Russia very much does pose a serious challenge, and it need not be a rising power to do so,"" Borshchevskaya said. ""We usually do not get Russia right. We vacillate between two extremes — call it a weak declining power on its way down, and then when a major Russia-driven crisis erupts and takes us by surprise, we elevate it to a genius-like status."" She believes the U.S. will need to handle Russia more strategically. Russia and China are different, but the challenges they pose cannot be overlooked. A senior fellow for Cyber Security at the Council on Foreign Relations, David Fidler suggested this attack should be a turning point on how the U.S. government and the private sector handles cybersecurity.

There may be another group of hackers at work in the wake of the devastating SolarWinds attack. A Microsoft blog hints at a second hacking attempt not related to the initial hack of the SolarWinds software. In that first attack, Russian actors hacked software updates for popular network monitoring tool SolarWinds Orion, described as a ""supply chain"" hack. As a result, multiple government agencies were breached. A number of Big Tech companies have also installed SolarWinds software, including Cisco, Intel and ware, according to The Wall Street Journal. , ""In an interesting turn of events, the investigation of the whole SolarWinds compromise led to the discovery of an additional malware,"" Microsoft said in the post. In all, the attack could have impacted as many as 18,000 of SolarWinds' customers, the company said. Despite the second attack going after SolarWinds' Orion product, Microsoft determined it is ""likely unrelated to this compromise and used by a different threat actor,"" widely assumed to be another cybercriminal organization. In the blog post, Microsoft described the additional malware discovered as ""a small persistence backdoor in the form of a file,"" referring to a Dynamic Link Library. Files with a ""."" extension are commonly found in Windows. Unlike the original attack, ""this malicious does not have a digital signature, which suggests that this may be unrelated"" to the first attack, Microsoft explained. Redmond, Wash.-based Microsoft has not identified the malware by name, but analysis by security researchers at Palo Alto Networks refer to it as ""Supernova."" There’s been some confusion because security researchers thought that Supernova was possibly tied to the first attack, according to et. However, the news outlet reported that is not the case, citing a follow-up analysis from Microsoft's security teams. The upshot is companies that have SolarWinds with Supernova need to handle it as a separate attack. '' Experts believe there is more to be uncovered about the attacks and how widespread they were. ""There is still much we don't know, including exactly how the supply chain hack was accomplished, what other vectors were used besides SolarWinds, how many victims were impacted, what the adversary's objectives were and what information they were able to obtain, what they will do with that information, and more,"" Suzanne Spaulding, advisor to Nozomi Networks and former undersecretary of cyber and infrastructure, said in a statement sent to Fox News.

'S : ""[T]here was a significant effort to use a piece of third-party software to essentially embed code inside of U.S. Government systems and now it appears systems of private companies and companies and governments across the world as well,"" Pompeo said.

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo visits the White House with family members, Friday, Dec. 11, 2020, in Washington. Russians were widely suspected of having carried out the attack, but no government official or entity had publicly confirmed who was behind it prior to Pompeo’s comments. Trump has made no public statements about the breach. Russian President Vladimir Putin denies the country's alleged involvement. The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency said in an unusual warning message Thursday that the hack compromised federal agencies and ""critical infrastructure"" in a sophisticated attack that was hard to detect and will be difficult to undo. officials did not respond to questions, and so it was unclear what the agency meant by a ""grave threat"" or by ""critical infrastructure"" possibly targeted in the attack that the agency says appeared to have begun last March. Homeland Security, the agency's parent department, defines such infrastructure as any ""vital"" assets to the U.S. or its economy -- a broad category that could include power plants and financial institutions. The agency previously said the perpetrators had used network management software from Texas-based SolarWinds to infiltrate computer networks. Its new alert said the attackers may have used other methods, as well. ? A As it stands now, the U.S. State Department, Department of Homeland Security , and elements of the Department of Defense have reported being compromised. The hack may have lasted for months, targeting Treasury and Commerce departments. Government agencies, such as the Department of Energy, moved quickly to protect themselves and investigate the incidents. ""At this point, the investigation has found that the malware has been isolated to business networks only, and has not impacted the mission-essential national security functions of the Department, including the National Nuclear Security Administration ,"" Spokeswoman Shaylyn Hynes told Fox News. ""When identified vulnerable software, immediate action was taken to mitigate the risk, and all software identified as being vulnerable to this attack was disconnected from the network.""

The and work closely together under the Department of Defense, and are both overseen by four star Gen. Paul M. Nakasone. The push to separate them during President Trump’s final days in office, is the latest move by the Trump administration to shake up the Pentagon. Miller was named acting secretary in early November, after Trump unexpectedly sacked Defense Secretary Mark Esper. Esper had condemned the use of the Insurrection Act during nationwide protests this summer. The 1807 Act would have allowed Trump to deploy National Guard troops within the U.S. Miller continued the Pentagon shake-up by hiring loyal Trump officials and firing head of the Pentagon’s Defeat Task Force Christopher P. Maier, earlier this month. The U.S. also withdrew thousands of troops from the Middle East and Africa. Smith’s letter Thursday condemned not only the apparent method considered for the cyber defense split, but the timing. ""Any action to sever the dual-hat relationship could have grave impacts on our national security, especially during a time that the country is wrestling with what may be the most damaging cyber-attack in our country’s history,"" he wrote in his letter to Miller and chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Army Gen.

2020-12-19,Fox,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/cyberattack-russia-trump-rebecca-grant,Rebecca Grant: Cyberattacks against US will intensify — Biden must bolster ability to defend and strike back,"Former Chief of Station Dan Hoffman says ‘we still don’t know’ how much information Russians accessed during the attack. The recently discovered massive cyberattack on U.S. government and industry computer networks by a foreign adversary isn’t the first nor will it be the last such hostile action. While the Trump administration has strengthened U.S. defenses and revved up America’s cyber offense, it’s clear that the incoming Biden administration will need to do a lot more because the attacks are becoming increasingly sophisticated. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Friday that ""we can say pretty clearly that it was the Russians"" who launched the cyberattack, carried out by embedding malware into several U.S. government agencies and businesses. However, President Trump sought to downplay the attacks in two tweets Saturday. '' ‘ ’ ""The Cyber Hack is far greater in the Fake News Media than in actuality,"" the president tweeted. ""I have been fully briefed and everything is well under control. Russia, Russia, Russia is the priority chant when anything happens because Lamestream is, for mostly financial reasons, petrified of discussing the possibility that it may be China ."" Now, of course, Russia did it. I have no trouble believing Russian President Vladimir Putin would approve such a move because it fits into his much larger strategy to tear down American power. But Trump is right; China is also capable of pulling off this mischief. So what happens now? If you are anticipating a dramatic U.S. response against Russia, don’t hold your breath. The first response was a Washington political fight. Increasing our cybersecurity ought to be a bipartisan issue. But sadly, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., responded to the cyberattack with partisan fury aimed at Trump. In a statement Friday night, Pelosi said ""the Trump Administration has for four years turned a blind eye to Putin’s attacks."" Piling on, Obama administration Director of National Intelligence James Clapper told that the Russian hack was a massive intelligence failure. Time for a fact check: Pelosi is wrong. The Trump administration freed the U.S. Cyber Command to roam and maneuver in bad-actor networks, with new rules issued in a presidential directive in September 2018. President-elect Joe Biden was right when he said Thursday: ""A good defense isn’t enough; we need to disrupt and deter our adversaries from undertaking significant cyberattacks in the first place."" But then he jumped into political attack mode. ""I will not stand idly by in the face of cyber assaults on our nation,"" Biden said, as if Trump was standing idly by. Despite the faux shock from Biden, Pelosi and others, our nation’s leaders from both political parties have known for years that Russia is a nimble and evil adversary in cyberspace. The problem became obvious when Russia shut down Estonia with a devastating cyberattack in April 2007. Estonia revamped its entire cybersecurity structure. Today ’s cybersecurity center of excellence is based in Estonia. So what happened here in America? Years of failure to invest in proper secure software and hardware left government networks vulnerable. Elected officials of both political parties can share the blame. Importantly, the government computer networks that have been hacked are not the super-secret networks, which are more protected. We know of a number of cyberattacks against the U.S. government in recent years. For example, China hacked the U.S. Office of Personnel Management and caused a data breach affecting 20 million Americans, including current and former federal employees and applicants for federal jobs. When word leaked out about this attack in 2015, the Obama-Biden administration chose not to blame China publicly. Clapper, who was then serving as director of national intelligence, told Congress that China was just engaged in ""passive intelligence collection"" and had not launched a real cyberattack. ""You have to kind of salute the Chinese for what they did"" he said, in admiration of China’s technical skill. Russia, China, Iran, North Korea and others have accelerated their cyberattacks in recent years and no doubt will continue to do so. According to Crowdstrike’s ""2019 Global Threat Report"", there are ""more than 240 billion events [computer hacks or attempted hacks] every 24 hours — more than the number of tweets Twitter processes in an entire year."" The Crowdstrike report shows that the Russians are masters of cyberattacks. Russian intrusions took on average just 18 seconds to break out from gaining entry into a computer network to spread through the network. China was slower at four minutes on average — but some Chinese attacks needed only 12 seconds. Defenders have just seconds to respond. That’s getting harder and harder. Understand that while cyberdefense is important, the game has shifted. Cyberwar is a lightning duel of offense, intrusion and intimidation. The keys to success are automation to respond instantly and going on offense. This is why Congress and President Trump gave the U.S. Cyber Command strong new powers in late 2018. Given a longer leash, Cyber Command acted immediately. American ""military hackers are breaking into foreign networks, striking at enemy hackers and planting cyber bombs that would disable infrastructure in the event of a conflict,"" reported Ken Dilanian on June 23, 2019 in a story on the News website headlined ""Under Trump, U.S. military ramps up cyber offensive against other countries."" But while counter-hacking into Russia’s power grid and other vital infrastructure can create deterrence, U.S. officials are very reluctant to act overtly. Here are four reasons for this. The intelligence community likes to watch Russia and other intruders move through computer networks and conduct low-grade, daily attacks. When cyber intruders use known paths, risks are contained. The U.S. Cyber Command can even gain information on adversary capabilities. Striking back alerts the Russians and other attackers, and forces them to seek new means of entry. That’s more dangerous. Not everyone approves of this approach, but it’s a factor. Russia and the United States have until Feb. 5 to renew or cancel the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty . Some will say this is no time to provoke President Putin with cyber retaliation. Cyber experts also fear accidental damage. ""It’s complicated,"" Clapper said Friday. No kidding. ""The truth is we don’t fully understand how all these networks fit together, and there can be unintended results,"" Michael Daniel, of the Cyber Threat Alliance and a top cybersecurity official in the Obama administration, said in 2018. Cyber specialists prefer to penetrate the networks, but they hold back from shutting systems down or causing other touchable damage. Most of all, America needs to be able to launch cyberattacks in wartime to disable enemy air defense networks, missile launch systems and other important targets. The U.S. Cyber Command may not want to act now and reveal and sacrifice its special tools and access points. Right now Russia, China, North Korea, Iran and others don’t know all the U.S. can do to them in a cyberattack. Let’s keep it that way, this argument goes. Unfortunately, Russia has pioneered cyberwar and excels at it. Team Trump empowered America’s cyberwarriors to match enemies move for move. But Team Biden will have to do even more, or America may suffer serious damage.",20,1.8420711824986935,1.8997674086268062,-0.05769622612811265,24
2020-12-19,Fox,https://www.foxnews.com/world/us-shuttering-last-2-consulates-russia,US says it is shuttering last 2 consulates in Russia,"Ex- Sam Palmisano and Cyber Readiness Institute Managing Director Kiersten Todt join 'Special Report' with analysis – The Trump administration has notified Congress that it intends to shutter the last two remaining U.S. consulates in Russia. The State Department told lawmakers last week that it would permanently close the consulate in the far eastern Russian city of Vladivostok and temporarily suspend operations at the consulate in Yekaterinburg just east of the Ural Mountains. The notice was sent to Congress on Dec. 10 but received little attention at the time. That timing predates by three days the public emergence of news about a major suspected Russian computer intrusion into U.S. government and private computer systems that has raised grave cybersecurity fears. Russian President Vladimir Putin gestures as he speaks via video call during a news conference as journalists wearing face masks to protect against coronavirus, observe social distancing guidelines watch him at a big screen in Moscow, Russia, Thursday, Dec. 17, 2020. This year, Putin attended his annual news conference online due to the coronavirus pandemic. The department’s notification to Congress, a copy of which was obtained by The Associated Press, said the closures are due to caps placed by Russian authorities in 2017 on the number of U.S. diplomats allowed to work in the country. The moves are ""in response to ongoing staffing challenges of the U.S. Mission in Russia in the wake of the 2017 Russian-imposed personnel cap on the Mission and resultant impasse with Russia over diplomatic visas,"" it said. ' ' Following the closures, the only diplomatic facility the U.S. will have in Russia will be the embassy in Moscow. Russia ordered the closure of the U.S. consulate in St. Petersburg in 2018 after the U.S. ordered the Russian consulate in Seattle closed in tit-for-tat actions over the poisoning of an ex-Russian spy in Britain. The consulate in Vladivostok had been temporarily closed in March because of the coronavirus pandemic, and staffers there had already begun removing sensitive equipment, documents and other items. The consulates in Vladivostok and Yekaterinburg employ a total of 10 American diplomats and 33 local staff. The exact timing of the closures has yet to be determined. The American staff are to be relocated to the embassy in Moscow, while the locals will be laid off, according to the notice. The department estimated the permanent closure of the Vladivostok consulate would save $3.2 million per year.",20,3.5443505207402257,3.0775973001413863,0.4667532205988394,7
2020-12-19,Fox,https://www.foxnews.com/tech/hacked-networks-burned-down-to-the-ground,Hacked networks will need to be burned 'down to the ground',"Ex-White House Chief Information Officer Theresa Payton joins 'Bill Hemmer Reports' to assess cyberattack on federal agencies It's going to take months to kick elite hackers widely believed to be Russian out of the U.S. government networks they have been quietly rifling through since as far back as March in Washington's worst cyberespionage failure on record. Experts say there simply are not enough skilled threat-hunting teams to duly identify all the government and private-sector systems that may have been hacked. FireEye, the cybersecurity company that discovered the intrusion into U.S. agencies and was among the victims, has already tallied dozens of casualties. It's racing to identify more. ""We have a serious problem. We don't know what networks they are in, how deep they are, what access they have, what tools they left,"" said Bruce Schneier, a prominent security expert and Harvard fellow. : FireEye offices in Milpitas, Calif. It's not clear exactly what the hackers were seeking, but experts say it could include nuclear secrets, blueprints for advanced weaponry, -19 vaccine-related research and information for dossiers on key government and industry leaders. Many federal workers — and others in the private sector — must presume that unclassified networks are teeming with spies. Agencies will be more inclined to conduct sensitive government business on Signal, WhatsApp and other encrypted smartphone apps. ""We should buckle up. This will be a long ride,"" said Dmitri Alperovitch, co-founder and former chief technical officer of the leading cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike. ""Cleanup is just phase one."" The only way to be sure a network is clean is ""to burn it down to the ground and rebuild it,"" Schneier said. : ' ' Imagine a computer network as a mansion you inhabit, and you are certain a serial killer as been there. ""You don't know if he's gone. How do you get work done? You kind of just hope for the best,"" he said. Deputy White House press secretary Brian Morgenstern told reporters Friday that national security adviser Robert O'Brien has sometimes been leading multiple daily meetings with the , the Department of Homeland Security and the intelligence community, looking for ways to mitigate the hack. He would not provide details, ""but rest assured we have the best and brightest working hard on it each and every single day."" The Democratic chairs of four House committees given classified briefings on the hack by the Trump administration issued a statement complaining that they ""were left with more questions than answers."" ""Administration officials were unwilling to share the full scope of the breach and identities of the victims,"" they said. Morgenstern said earlier that disclosing such details only helps U.S. adversaries. President Donald Trump has not commented publicly on the matter, but Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on a conservative talk show Friday, ""I think it's the case that now we can say pretty clearly that it was the Russians that engaged in this activity."" : The sign outside the National Security Agency campus in Fort Meade, Md. What makes this hacking campaign so extraordinary is its scale — 18,000 organizations were infected from March to June by malicious code that piggybacked on popular network-management software from an Austin, Texas, company called SolarWinds. Only a sliver of those infections were activated to allow hackers inside. FireEye says it has identified dozens of examples, all ""high-value targets."" Microsoft, which has helped respond, says it has identified more than 40 government agencies, think tanks, government contractors, non-governmental organizations and technology companies infiltrated by the hackers, 75% in the United States. Florida became the first state to acknowledge falling victim to a SolarWinds hack. Officials told The Associated Press on Friday that hackers apparently infiltrated the state's health care administration agency and others. SolarWinds' customers include most Fortune 500 companies, and it's U.S. government clients are rich with generals and spymasters. The difficulty of extracting the suspected Russian hackers' tool kits is exacerbated by the complexity of SolarWinds' platform, which has dozen of different components. ""This is like doing heart surgery, to pull this out of a lot of environments,"" said Edward Amoroso, of Cyber. Security teams then have to assume that the patient is still sick with undetected so-called ""secondary infections"" and set up the cyber equivalent of closed-circuit monitoring to make sure the intruders are not still around, sneaking out internal emails and other sensitive data. That effort will take months, Alperovitch said. If the hackers are indeed from Russia's foreign intelligence agency, as experts believe, their resistance may be tenacious. When they hacked the White House, the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the State Department in 2014 and 2015 ""it was a nightmare to get them out,"" Alperovitch said. ""It was the virtual equivalent of hand-to-hand combat"" as defenders sought to keep their footholds, ""to stay buried deep inside"" and move to other parts of the network where ""they thought that they could remain for longer periods of time."" ""We're likely going to face the same in this situation as well,"" he added. 'S 5 , 18K FireEye executive Charles Carmakal said the intruders are especially skilled at camouflaging their movements. Their software effectively does what a military spy often does in wartime — hide among the local population, then sneak out at night and strike. ""It's really hard to catch some of these,"" he said. Rob Knake, the White House cybersecurity director from 2011 to 2015, said the harm to the most critical agencies in the U.S. government — defense and intelligence, chiefly — from the SolarWinds hacking campaign is going to be limited ""as long as there is no evidence that the Russians breached classified networks."" During the 2014-15 hack, ""we lost access to unclassified networks but were able to move all operations to classified networks with minimal disruptions,"" he said via email. The Pentagon has said it has so far not detected any intrusions from the SolarWinds campaign in any of its networks — classified or unclassified. , - 'S Given the fierce tenor of cyberespionage — the U.S., Russia and China all have formidable offensive hacking teams and have been penetrating each others' government networks for years — many American officials are wary of putting anything sensitive on government networks. Fiona Hill, the top Russia expert at the National Security Council during much of the Trump administration, said she always presumed no government system was secure. She ""tried from the beginning not to put anything down"" in writing that was sensitive. ""But that makes it more difficult to do business."" Amoroso, of Cyber, recalled the famous pre-election dispute in 2016 over classified emails sent over a private server set up by Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton when she was secretary of state. Clinton was investigated by the in the matter, but no charges were brought.",20,1.488279613999815,1.371130293793789,0.11714932020602586,13

Mitt Romney, a Utah Republican, slammed the White House for ""inexcusable silence and inaction"" for almost a week following reports of Russian cyberattacks on software company SolarWinds and, by extension, government agencies. The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency announced the intrusion involving SolarWinds Orion products, which is now under investigation, on Sunday and directed all federal agencies to disconnect from the breached network-management software. President Trump was reportedly briefed on the suspected Russian hack on Thursday but has yet to comment publicly on what Romney said would be the digital equivalent of discovering ""Russian bombers have been repeatedly flying undetected over our entire country."" Top senators on the Armed Services Committee have cautioned that the cyberattack on U.S. government is ""ongoing"" and ""has the hallmarks of a Russian intelligence operation."" The hack compromised federal agencies and ""critical infrastructure"" in a sophisticated attack that was hard to detect and will be difficult to undo, the cybersecurity agency said in an unusual warning message Thursday. The Department of Energy acknowledged it was among the agencies that had been hacked. U.S. The attack, if authorities can prove it was carried out by Russia as experts believe, creates a fresh foreign policy problem for Trump in his final days in office. Trump's silence on the matter has garnered scrutiny from both sides of the aisle, especially when paired with his past handling of issues concerning Russia, including eliminating a White House cybersecurity adviser and downplaying Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. Romney said the attack illustrates an ""alarming U.S. vulnerability,"" and an ""apparent cyber warfare weakness."" ""It's past time for a national security re-set that prioritizes cybersecurity capabilities and defenses,"" he said. Thomas Bossert, a former Trump Homeland Security adviser, said in an opinion article in The New York Times earlier this week that the U.S. should now act as if the Russian government had gained control of the networks it has penetrated.

Amid revelations about massive hacking of government and private sector systems since March and that Russia's Foreign Intelligence Service, the , is probably behind it, Putin's words seemed to turn reality on its head. The Trump administration has not accused Russia and Russia has denied doing it. But concerns about this hack grow as tech experts try to get a handle on the scope of the operation. The departments of Commerce, Treasury, Homeland Security and the Pentagon were affected. The U.S. agency that controls the nuclear stockpile said its systems were compromised, but that the hack did not affect ""mission essential national security functions,"" according to a Department of Energy spokesperson. Russian Presidential candidate, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin delivers a speech during a rally of his supporters at the Luzhniki stadium in Moscow on Feb. 23, 2012.

Nearly half of the affected companies were technology firms entrusted with security. Thousands more may have been hacked. Microsoft said this was ""not espionage as usual."" The hack was an act of recklessness that created a serious technological vulnerability for the U.S. and the world, Microsoft said. Several other countries were targeted but the U.S. was hit worst. The hackers showed a new level of stealth, using Texas-based Solar Winds Software to infiltrate computer networks, taking the footprint far from Russia, and the malware attached may still be working. Connecticut Sen. Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat, tweeted ""Russia's cyberattack left me deeply alarmed, in fact downright scared."" '' , Experts in West have taken a more skeptical view of Russia's capabilities and what they may have done. ""Why would you release this information if it’s true?"" asked Igor Pellicciari, professor of international relations at the University of Urbino in Italy.

Just how competent is Russian intelligence is with budget strains of a ruble, the Russian currency, in freefall and oil prices dropping all under the press of international sanctions? Pellicciari said Russia throws resources at areas it identifies as priority. Spies, he said, are a priority and Putin's support base, particularly in the lower classes is with, ""Big Brother watching us, because he protects us."" But Italian journalist Anna Zafesova casts doubt on the state of Russian spycraft, pointing to the recent botched poisonings of former Russian spy Sergei Skripal in Salisbury, England, and Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny in Siberia. In both cases, the poisoners were identified, called out, and their movements detailed in the press albeit amidst Russian denials. Navalny pointed out recently that if Russia has people dying on gurneys in emergency room corridors, the state of its spy agencies must be shabby, too. And perhaps that extends to hackers. ""If you were smart -- a good hacker -- you wouldn't go to work for - you go to Silicon Valley, the ,"" she told Fox News. ""You go get paid in dollars."" But the crowd is known to be driven by patriotism. If Russia was directly involved, it is not clear what the supposed hackers and their alleged paymasters in the Kremlin would do with the data it siphoned out. Now caught, they may try to lash out, some fear. Pellicciari thinks that Russia's endgame with the United States is that Russia wants its old superpower role back. ""They want to negotiate new spheres of influence with the United States. They want a sort of coordinated disagreement, coordinated competition,"" he said. It's not looking for a real partnership or collaboration, Zafesova said, because Russia knows at this point it has nothing to offer the U.S. Few details are known to the wider public about the mass hacking.

2020-12-17,Fox,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/thomas-bossert-russia-solarwinds-hack,"Former Trump adviser points finger at Russia for 'brazen' SolarWinds hack, calls for response","Russia is denying involvement in hacking internal communications at the departments of Treasury, Homeland Security and Commerce; Benjamin Hall reports. Thomas Bossert, former Homeland Security adviser to President Trump, in a Wednesday op-ed said there is evidence that Russia is to blame for what he called a ""brazen"" cyberattack on software company SolarWinds through cybersecurity company FireEye. The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency announced the foreign cyberattack involving SolarWinds Orion products, which is now under investigation, on Sunday and directed all federal agencies to inspect their networks. 'S 5 , 18K A U.S. official told the Associated Press that Russia is a suspect in the attack that began as early as March. Russia denies any involvement. ""Last week, the cybersecurity firm FireEye said it had been hacked and that its clients, which include the United States government, had been placed at risk. This week, we learned that SolarWinds, a publicly traded company that provides software to tens of thousands of government and corporate customers, was also hacked,"" Bossert wrote. He added later that he suspected the attack was the ""product of a nation-state,"" saying that ""evidence in the SolarWinds attack points to the Russian intelligence agency known as the S.V.R., whose tradecraft is among the most advanced in the world."" Bossert went on to say that he believes it will take years to know which networks Russian hackers have complete control over and which ones they merely occupy. ""The Russians have had access to a considerable number of important and sensitive networks for six to nine months,"" he wrote. ""The Russian S.V.R. will surely have used its access to further exploit and gain administrative control over the networks it considered priority targets. For those targets, the hackers will have long ago moved past their entry point, covered their tracks and gained what experts call 'persistent access,' meaning the ability to infiltrate and control networks in a way that is hard to detect or remove."" The Department of Defense said Thursday it has found ""no evidence of compromise"" in its information network. ""We continue to assess our Information Network for indicators of compromise and take targeted actions to protect our systems beyond the defensive measures we employ each day,"" said Vice Admiral Nancy Norton, director of the Defense Information Systems Agency. ""To date, we have no evidence of compromise of the . We will continue to work with the whole-of-government effort to mitigate cyber threats to the nation."" For those targets that Russians now control, hackers will be able to alter or destroy data and impersonate employees, the former Homeland Security adviser said. About 33,000 companies use SolarWinds Orion products, according to the software company, which estimates that about 18,000 companies were directly impacted by the hack. ""SolarWinds...has been made aware of a cyberattack that inserted a vulnerability within its Orion monitoring products which, if present and activated, could potentially allow an attacker to compromise the server on which the Orion products run,"" SolarWinds said in a Monday filing. The statement continued: ""SolarWinds has retained third-party cybersecurity experts to assist in an investigation of these matters, including whether a vulnerability in the Orion monitoring products was exploited as a point of any infiltration of any customer systems, and in the development of appropriate mitigation and remediation plans."" U.S. federal agencies including the Departments of the Treasury, Commerce, State, Homeland Security and elements of the Defense Department have been compromised as of Thursday.

Jack Keane reacts. Public and private agencies and businesses worldwide have been left urgently trying to determine if they have been hit by what could amount to one of the most extensive hacking campaigns in recent decades. The fallout continues less than 48 hours after the U.S. government issued an emergency warning Sunday mandating government users disconnect from the breached network-management software, SolarWinds. ""In a nutshell, SolarWinds' Orion product provides centralized monitoring across an organization's entire stack. That means the attackers who were able to compromise this platform had an extremely high level of access to all of these client systems,"" David Kennedy, of TrustedSec told Fox News. A former hacker for the National Security Agency and the Marine Corps, Kennedy also noted that ""since this type of attack is so stealthy, and the attackers used a legitimate piece of software to backdoor their own malicious code, it can be very difficult for companies to identify if they were part of this attack."" As it stands now, the U.S. State Department, Department of Homeland Security , and elements of the Department of Defense have reported being compromised. Those government branches join earlier assessments confirming that the Departments of Treasury and Commerce had been breached in what investigators believe to be a mass-scale Russian intelligence operation. However, SolarWinds' clientele roster traverses some 300,000 organizations – including other highly-sensitive federal agencies ranging from the Department of Justice and the Centers for Disease Control – as well as thousands of private companies. Almost all Fortune 500 companies are reported to use SolarWinds products to scan their networks, including major defense contractors such as Boeing, according to the New York Times. The technology company said in its security advisory on Tuesday that no more than 18,000 customers had downloaded the maligned software, which essentially allowed hackers to infiltrate systems undetected for up to nine months. In its regulatory disclosure, SolarWinds surmised that malicious code was inserted into updates of its Orion network management software disseminated between March and June this year. ""We have been advised that this incident was likely the result of a highly sophisticated, targeted, and manual supply chain attack by an outside nation-state,"" the company stated. ""But we have not independently verified the identity of the attacker."" However, investigators and cyber experts are already pointing the finger at Moscow, which has denied any involvement. Nonetheless, preliminary reviews of the encroachments suspect that the sophistication of the attacks lends itself to the work of Russia's Foreign Intelligence Service . The belief that the is behind the attacks stems from the hackers being especially judicious in drawing data from particular targets. ""Given the list of organizations using SolarWind's Orion platform, the potential impact could expose highly sensitive information and compromise national security,"" said Randy Watkins, Chief Technology Officer. ""Since the attacks are associated with a nation-state, widely expected to be Russia, the intent behind the attack could be anything from policy leverage and military strategy to the theft of weapons system designs."" This file photo shows an -illuminated wireless router in Philadelphia. 6 , Former hacker Kennedy also asserted that the most likely goal of this attack was to steal military secrets and technology and to surveil the U.S. government. ""However, a foreign adversary like Russia would also benefit from gaining access to America's financial system and the intellectual property of major corporations, so the damage could be vast,"" he said. ""We won't know the full damage from this breach for at least several months, and possibly years."" And while the scope of the aperture is yet to be determined, U.S. security officials are also scrambling to assess the damage. Vahid Behzadan, an assistant professor of engineering at the University of New Haven, noted that – based on the targeted organizations and agencies – ""the attack seems to be mainly an espionage operation, aiming to exfiltrate as much sensitive information and tools as possible."" ""Due to the expansive list of targets, it is difficult to say whether this was an attempt at mass data collection, or whether the attack targeted specific sources of information and masked this intent with secondary breaches,"" he continued. The National Security Council – also a SolarWinds user – on Monday conducted a second emergency meeting of its Cyber Response Group to discuss what happened and is reportedly summoning a subsidiary body. Several lawmakers have called for action to discern the breadth of the attacks and what resources agencies will now need to safeguard their networks.",20,0.8825866848713906,2.578784549477962,-1.6961978646065714,13

It’s only the fifth emergency directive issued by since 2015. U.S. The intrusion into the Treasury and Commerce department systems, first reported by Reuters, is believed to be connected to a breach at cybersecurity firm FireEye. The hackers may have infiltrated the systems by piggybacking on SolarWinds, a server software used by scores of government agencies and a majority of Fortune 500 companies. The directive warned that the “compromise of SolarWinds’ Orion Network Management Products poses unacceptable risks to the security of federal networks.” FireEye, according to the Associated Press, said its investigation into the hacking identified a “global campaign” that targeted governments and businesses in the private sector by inserting malware into SolarWinds updates beginning last spring. The malware gave the hackers remote access to the compromised computer networks for months. FireEye said it confirmed intrusions in North America, Europe, Asia and the Middle East. '' SolarWinds said there was a “potential vulnerability” related to its updates between March and June for software products called Orion and is working with the , FireEye and the intelligence community, the reported. “We believe that this vulnerability is the result of a highly sophisticated, targeted and manual supply chain attack by a nation state,” SolarWinds Kevin Thompson said in a statement.

The cyberespionage group, known as 29 and Cozy Bear, was behind the hacking of the State Department and White House in 2014 and the Democratic National Committee during the 2016 presidential election. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov denied that Russia was involved. “Once again, I can reject these accusations,” Peskov told reporters. “If for many months the Americans couldn’t do anything about it, then, probably, one shouldn’t unfoundedly blame the Russians for everything.”",20,1.2175139574181946,3.275196880008723,-2.057682922590528,24

One U.S. government count put the number of American personnel affected at 26. , For more than four years, dozens of American diplomats and intelligence personnel stationed in Cuba, Russia, China, and even on U.S. soil have reported a range of odd symptoms – from fatigue and headaches to impaired hearing, dizziness and memory loss – with no known origin or cause. Those impacted – including former officer Marc Polymeropoulos, who was forced into retirement given his persistent headaches, tinnitus, and loss of long-distance vision after being targeted while in a Moscow hotel in late 2017 – welcomed the support from both sides of the aisle. However, Polymeropoulos stressed there is much more that needs to happen. ""The bipartisanship nature of the bill is exactly what is needed on this issue, although more needs to be done as well,"" he told Fox News on Wednesday. ""I would also like to see hearings in both the intelligence and foreign affairs committees of both the House and Senate, both to address the medical needs of affected officials and to determine what is being done to stop future attacks.""

For more than four years, dozens of American diplomats and intelligence personnel stationed in Cuba, Russia, China, and even on U.S. soil have reported a range of odd ailments – from fatigue and headaches to impaired hearing, dizziness and memory loss – with no known origin or cause. But according to a government-commissioned report released by the National Academies of Sciences over the weekend, the illness, dubbed ""Havana Syndrome,"" is ""most likely"" the result of direct microwave radiation. The working theory, established by a committee of 19 experts in medical and related fields, pinpointed ""directed, pulsed radio frequency energy"" as ""the most plausible mechanism"" to have triggered the wave of maladies. While the report did not attribute blame or state that the likely attacks were the work of malicious intent, it said the sicknesses stem from ""pulsed"" and ""directed"" frequencies, seemingly emanating from a specific area in the room in a well-honed direction. This indicates that the exposure was not ""continuous"" or induced by a secondary culprit, such as a microwave or mobile phone. , Marc Polymeropoulos, a retired operative, told Fox News on Monday that he was a victim of one of these attacks while in a hotel room in Russia in 2017. Since the episode, Polymeropoulos said he has been suffering from debilitating migraines for the last three years and the constant sense of something being very wrong. ""I have a terrible headache that never goes away, the loss of long-distance vision, tinnitus – ringing in the ears,"" he said. Polymeropoulos assumes he was probably targeted in Moscow because he was one of the officers in charge of overseeing America’s efforts against the Russian government. As for the findings from the report – which only examined those impacted in Cuba and not across the globe – Polymeropoulos said it was a welcome relief after his symptoms were dismissed by senior medical agency personnel. “A renowned group of scientists telling us we weren’t making this up, that this wasn’t psychosomatic, I can imagine others a sense of relief,” he said. The Academies' analysis did not attribute blame to any foreign power. Still, it did illuminate the decades-long use of the tactic and radio frequency research specifically by Russia – giving more credence to long-held speculation of Moscow being behind the likely sonic attacks. John Hardie, a Russian foreign policy specialist at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies , explained that during the Cold War, the Soviet intelligence services ""used methods that endangered the health and well-being of American diplomats and intelligence officers, such as beaming concentrated electronic pulses and microwaves to eavesdrop on the U.S. Embassy in Moscow – carcinogenic 'spy dust' used to track U.S. intelligence officers."" Nick Dowling, a defense fellow at the National Defense University as well as a two-time policy adviser for presidential campaigns, concurred that ""Russia is one of the most advanced technological adversaries in the world and is more than capable of developing a sonic weapon."" ""Russia has been the leader in using new technologies to attack targets in covert and confusing ways. Russia is an active leader in what strategists are calling the gray zone of warfare – attacks in the gray zone between war and peace,"" he said. ""Attacking U.S. diplomats in Cuba and China are likely experimentation with this weapon but also serves the political interests of antagonizing U.S. relations with Cuba and China and creates fear, disruption and distraction among U.S. diplomats and officials."" And although the bizarre symptoms first surfaced in Cuba around 2016, U.S. investigations at that time found no evidence that the Havana government was behind any targeted assaults of U.S. – and later Canadian – personnel. However, since relations were restored in the aftermath of the Soviet Union's collapse, there has been a longstanding rule that Russian and U.S. intelligence services do not physically harm each other's officers – if it can be avoided. "" generally the idea is just to break the rules of the game, which normally say rival intel services don't cause physical harm,"" said Matthew Schmidt, an associate professor of national security at the University of New Haven. ""This kind of thing meets the letter of that, it doesn't technically get physical, but it breaks the norm of behavior because it seems to cause pretty severe harm. That destabilizes the game. People are worried, people don't perform as well because they're sick, or they're worried about being hurt and taking precautions against it, which may make them less effective."" - In this April 17, 2018 file photo, a man walks beside Canada's embassy in Havana, Cuba. Canada announced Wednesday, Jan. 30, 2019, it is removing up to half of the Canadians at its embassy in Cuba after another diplomat was found to have fallen mysteriously ill. Canada has confirmed 14 cases of mysterious health problems since early 2017. The Russian Embassy told Fox News that the ""insinuation of Moscow's involvement is ""absolutely absurd and bizarre"" – but experts are quick to point to a sobering history. : Complicating the U.S. government probe is the vast array of differing prognostics and experiences. Some reports have pointed to individuals in either homes or hotels hearing high-pitched tones or jarring thuds from one direction or all around. Some endure a kind of tremoring or a wind-like pressure; some hear nothing at all. While generally not deemed life-threatening but certainly damaging and injurious, the alleged attacks would be borne out of a desire to drive a wedge between the U.S. and other countries and ""mark up the cost"" for a diplomat and their family serving American interests. Nonetheless, the report – which was sent to the U.S. State Department in August for review and has since been the subject of criticism for not being released sooner – recommends that the U.S. government put protocols in place to immediately open a probe should such incidents occur. Furthermore, several former and current government officials are pushing for further action to get to the root of what has happened – and could still be happening. It remains unclear just how many Americans have been impacted. However, around 60 are said to have been treated by experts at the Center for Brain Injury and Repair at the University of Pennsylvania.

""This is something worthy of a congressional hearing."" Polymeropoulos agreed that this needs to be a bipartisan issue, and understanding who is culpable is a pivotal mystery that intelligence agencies will need to solve. However, he stressed that in the meantime, there should also be a bipartisan push to ensure that victims – people who serve the United States in diplomatic and intel capacities as well as their families – receive immediate medical help for their injuries. Polymeropoulos said his move to go public has resulted in the submitting the necessary paperwork and him being accepted into the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, where he will begin treatment for traumatic brain injury in late January.",20,2.891268348786239,3.812798099736168,-0.921529750949929,27

Last week, the U.S. Treasury Department sanctioned a Russian government research institution linked to the Triton malware, which the Treasury called “the most dangerous threat activity publicly known.” The hackers, by weaponizing Triton, aim to disable industrial safety systems. “Such systems provide for the safe emergency shutdown of industrial processes at critical infrastructure facilities in order to protect human life,” the Treasury said in the statement. , , “This is … the first time an [Industrial Control Systems] cyberattack has ever been sanctioned,” Rob Lee, and co-founder of industrial cybersecurity platform provider Dragos, told Fox News. “This is entirely appropriate as this cyberattack was the first ever targeted explicitly towards human life. We are fortunate no one died and I'm glad to see governments take a strong stance condemning such attacks,” Lee added. Prior to the Treasury issuing the statement, the and Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency issued an advisory on a Russian state-sponsored threat, saying that the entity “has conducted a campaign against a wide variety of U.S. targets.” The and said they observed the Russian state-sponsored actor targeting U.S. state, local, territorial and tribal government networks, as well as aviation networks. said the “threat actor” successfully compromised network infrastructure and “exfiltrated,” aka stole, data from at least two victim servers. These network vulnerabilities targeted “are a boon for … state-sponsored threat actors,” Satnam Narang, staff research engineer at Tenable, told Fox News. Russia has also been ramping up malicious cyber operations targeting the U.S. presidential election. John Ratcliffe, the director of National Intelligence, issued a statement last week that Russia – along with Iran – had obtained voter registration information. “This data can be used by foreign actors to attempt to communicate false information to registered voters that they hope will cause confusion, sow chaos, and undermine your confidence in American democracy,” Ratcliffe said. The meddling is not expected to stop any time soon, experts say. ""We can be sure that Russia will continue these nefarious tactics post-election, as expected reporting delays will provide the perfect opportunity for these operatives to spread false narratives on, for example, the legitimacy of the results in order to sow confusion and possible unrest among Americans,"" Theresa Payton, former White House chief information officer who served under President George W. Bush from 2006-2008 and of Fortalice Solutions, told Fox News. , “The Russian state is among the most successful operators of disinformation campaigns,” according to a report this week from cybersecurity firm Digital Shadows. “Russia’s attempts at broader political influence overseas have been facilitated by its use of state-owned traditional media, bots, ‘hack and leak’ operations, and cooperation between organized crime groups and Russian government agencies,” the report said.",20,3.4595906517023747,1.9106026103781917,1.548988041324183,24

Despite the warning from U.S. intelligence officials about Russian interference, O’Brien tried to assure Americans that the hackers can’t change voters or make it harder to cast a ballot. , , ; A '' ""No, they can't do either of those things,” he said. “And we got ahold of them early on because we've got great cyber folks, and we put a stop to it, but there's nothing they can do to change your vote or to stop you from voting."" The advisory from the and the Department of Homeland Security's cybersecurity agency described last Thursday an onslaught of recent activity by a Russian state-sponsored hacking group against a broad range of networks, some of which were successfully compromised. The alert released Thursday functions as a reminder of Russia's potent capabilities and ongoing interference in the election even as U.S. officials publicly called out Iran on Wednesday night. The advisory does not identify by name or location those who were targeted, but officials say they have no information that any election or government operations have been affected or that the integrity of elections data has been compromised. “However, the actor may be seeking access to obtain future disruption options, to influence U.S. policies and actions, or to delegitimize government entities,” the advisory said. O’Brien on Sunday pointed out that there is difference between the interference campaigns by Russians and Iranian attempts to sway people’s opinions. ""Your vote is secret. Every American should understand that their vote is secret,” he said. “And that was an Iranian effort to hurt the president.” U.S. officials have repeatedly said it would be extremely difficult for hackers to alter vote tallies in a meaningful way, but they have warned about other methods of interference that could disrupt the election, including cyberattacks on networks meant to impede the voting process. The interference could continue during or after the tallying of ballots if Russians produce spoofed websites or fake content meant to confuse voters about election results and lead them to doubt the legitimacy of the outcome. A broad concern, particularly at the local government level, has been that hackers could infiltrate a county network and then work their way over to election-related systems unless certain defenses, such as firewalls, are in place. This is especially true for smaller counties that don’t have as much money and support as their bigger counterparts to fund security upgrades. Despite Iran's activities, Russia is widely regarded in the cybersecurity community as the bigger threat to the election. The U.S. has said that Russia, which interfered in the 2016 election by hacking Democratic email accounts and through a covert social media effort, is interfering again this year in part through a concerted effort to denigrate Trump’s Democratic opponent, Joe Biden.",20,4.014378803591566,2.2661666021349864,1.74821220145658,17

Four years ago, dozens of American officials stationed in Cuba started to hear odd cracks and humming in their ears – punctured by rushes of nausea, headaches, cloudy vision, memory loss, disequilibrium, and lethargy – all critical indicators of mild traumatic brain injury . The phenomenon was quickly dubbed the ""Havana syndrome."" And while similar symptoms have been documented by U.S. government employees in other places abroad, reports emerged this week suggesting that the potential sonic attacks might be far more pervasive than what was publicly known. In turn, more fingers are pointing toward Russia as being behind the global barrage of possible sonic attacks. ""There are a number of Americans who have fallen ill now, and we need to know why and who is behind it,"" Dan Hoffman, a former Moscow bureau chief who retired in early 2017, just before the strange illnesses began, told Fox News. ""This is something worthy of a congressional hearing."" In this Nov. 10, 2019, photo, tourists take a joy ride along the malecon sea wall in Havana, Cuba. The city of Havana celebrated its 500th anniversary on Nov. 16. According to former high-ranking officer Marc Polymeropoulos, a late 2017 Moscow trip – amid the calamity of the Russian election interference findings put forth by the U.S. intelligence community – came to an unpleasant end when he was riddled with vomiting and vertigo that persisted long after he returned home, G.Q. reported. ' ,' ' ' His ailments oddly lined up with those disclosed not only a year earlier in the newly-rehabilitated U.S. Embassy in Havana, but what would also start to unravel in China in 2018. In June that year, U.S. government staffers and intelligence officials in Guangzhou working specifically on Russian influence issues were sent back stateside following increasing anecdotes of illness and fatigue. Some said the onset of sickness also befell family members and began in late 2017. ""The safety and security of U.S. personnel, their families and U.S. citizens is our top priority,"" a statement from the U.S. State Department read at the time. ""The U.S. government has not yet determined a cause or an actor."" Russian President Vladimir Putin attends a cabinet meeting at the Novo-Ogaryovo residence outside Moscow, Russia, Tuesday, Aug. 11, 2020. While the administration did also launch an investigation concerning the matter in Cuba, withdrew the majority of its staffers coupled with a travel advisory, framed the happenings as ""targeted attacks,"" and expelled 15 Cuban diplomats from Washington, no real evidence of Cuban wrongdoing ever surfaced. Moreover, no hardline findings were ever brought to bear on the strange occurrences and dull pings. Canadian officials have also since withdrawn 14 citizens from Havana, citing eerily akin neurological conditions. Yet the peculiarities continue to pile up with few definitive answers. Then in November last year, as per , an unnamed White House staffer was additionally targeted by a man who exited a parked van and passed the staffer as she walked her dog in Arlington, Va. She later informed officials that she was riddled with intense headaches and face prickling, and even her canine companion started suffering from a sudden seizure. In a separate case months earlier, an unnamed American diplomat and his family purportedly heard similar mysterious sounds and fell ill while stationed in Philadelphia. Both the diplomat and his wife reported feeling pressure in their head before finding their children moving bizarrely and ""in unison"" in their sleep, reported. ""Sonic devices concentrate sound waves into a narrow cone of sound, extending about 15 degrees in every direction from the axis,"" explained John Wood, a defense analyst and author of ""Russia, the Asymmetric Threat to the United States."" ""This 'directional sound wave' focuses kinetic energy into a tight space. It is, therefore, an effective sound canon designed to disorientate and debilitate the hearer and disperse a crowd."" The anomalies have since surfaced in a slew of other countries ranging from Poland and Georgia to Taiwan and Australia, raising red flags over what covert weapons might be directed at U.S. personnel, and more scrutiny is turning to Moscow as a likely culprit. According to Wood, it is not yet evident that the attacks are related – but they are consistent with the employment of a sonic device. ""At both the civilian and military level, Russia has used such weapons against protesters and U.S. diplomats,"" he said. Hoffman also pointed out that such attacks, while generally not deemed life-threatening but certainly damaging and injurious, would be borne out of a desire to drive a wedge between the U.S. and other countries and ""mark up the cost"" for a diplomat and their family serving American interests. A large American flag is unfurled at the Pentagon But complicating the U.S. government probe is the vast array of differing prognostics and experiences. Some reports have pointed to individuals in either homes or hotels hearing high-pitched tones or jarring thuds from one direction or all around. Some endure a kind of tremoring or a wind-like pressure; some hear nothing at all. The New York Times this week underscored that the ""most compelling evidence"" implicating Moscow stems from publicly available data in which investigators were able to access location information from private companies, and affirmed that in each sonic-like case in 2019, ""individuals believed to be agents were within the range of the officers who had been hit."" U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Wednesday that the mysterious maladies are still under review and dismissed claims that American workers were not adequately protected. The has also rebuffed claims of neglect. The Russian Embassy told Fox News that the ""insinuation of Moscow's involvement is ""absolutely absurd and bizarre,"" – but experts are quick to point to a sobering history. Matthew Schmidt, national security and political science coordinator at the University of New Haven, emphasized that these apparent attacks bear the markings of a Soviet-style electromagnetic attack on the U.S. Embassy in Moscow in the '60s and '70s, and the ""Moscow Signal"" microwave incidents. ""The present-day incidents fit that pattern, and the fact that we've seen similar incidents [with] U.S. employees working in China and Cuba, Russia's close allies, bolsters the case,"" he conjectured. ""Generally, the idea is just to break the rules of the game, which normally say rival intel services don't cause physical harm. That destabilizes the game. People are worried, people don't perform as well because they're sick, or they're worried about being hurt and taking precautions against it, which may make them less effective."" : I'M John Hardie, a Russian foreign policy specialist at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies , concurred that during the height of the Cold War, the Soviet intelligence services likewise ""used methods that endangered the health and well-being of American diplomats and intelligence officers, such as beaming concentrated electronic pulses and microwaves to eavesdrop on the U.S. Embassy in Moscow carcinogenic 'spy dust' used to track U.S. intelligence officers."" However, since relations between the two rivals were restored in the aftermath of the Soviet Union's collapse, there has been a longstanding rule of conduct between the Russian and U.S. intelligence services that they do not do physical harm to one another's officers if it can be avoided. these reports seem to indicate a new and different practice,"" observed Matthew Rojansky, Director of the Kennan Institute at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars and adjunct lecturer at the Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies at Johns Hopkins University. ""This is not a brand new technology, but the weaponization of it in this particular way is fairly novel. So it's hard to say that it clearly has a Russian signature, but it seems to have Russian hallmarks."" Still, neither the cause nor the authority behind the evolving ""Havana Phenomenon"" remains subject to speculation, and what remains unclear is just how many Americans have been impacted, although around 60 are said to have been treated by experts at the Center for Brain Injury and Repair at the University of Pennsylvania.

2020-10-22,Fox,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/no-surprise-russia-and-iran-want-trump-out-national-security-adviser-obrien,'No surprise' Russia and Iran want Trump out: National Security Adviser O'Brien,"Insight from the Trump administration's National Security Adviser on 'Fox &amp; Friends.’ National Security Adviser Robert O'Brien explained to “Fox & Friends” on Thursday why he believes Iran and Russia allegedly tried to interfere with the 2020 elections. “It’s no surprise that Iran has done this,” O'Brien said, citing the fact that because Trump has pulled the U.S. out of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, Iran been “cut off” from “billions of dollars of the jackpot that they received when they signed the .” The Iran nuclear deal framework – officially the – was a historic agreement reached by Iran and several world powers, including the U.S., in 2015, under Barack Obama’s presidency. Three years later, President Trump announced that he would be pulling the U.S. out of the Iran nuclear deal, calling the agreement “defective at its core.” “All those billions have been cut off so there’s no surprise that they’re getting involved in our election,” O'Brien said. “They don’t like the fact that the Abraham Accords were signed and that Israel’s making peace with all their Arab neighbors so it’s no surprise there with Iran.” “The same thing with Russia,” he continued, adding that “the president’s been tougher on Russia than any administration since Ronald Reagan.” “We see that they’re out on Twitter and various places with disinformation,” O'Brien said. “You can see the same thing with China.” “China goes about trying to cultivate local leaders, mayors and governors and congressmen and convince them that if they don’t vote China’s way or they don’t do what China wants, China won’t invest in their districts or their cities and that sort of thing,” he explained. - : O'Brien added that “there are other countries that are attempting to do things via cyber and Twitter and Facebook.” He noted that intelligence officials have not yet disclosed that information publicly. “So what we ask the American people to do is just make sure that the information you get is from a trusted source,” he stressed. O'Brien made the comments the morning after Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe said at an press conference that Iran and Russia are attempting to sway the 2020 elections and have obtained some voter registration information. Ratcliffe noted on Wednesday night that both nations had taken specific actions to influence voters' opinions. He said that the registration information they obtained could be used to confuse voters through false communication. The Iranian interference that's been discovered, Ratcliffe said, has been designed to incite social unrest and damage the president. The news conference was held as Democratic voters in at least four battleground states, including Florida and Pennsylvania, have received threatening emails, falsely purporting to be from the far-right group Proud Boys, that warned “we will come after you” if the recipients didn’t vote for President Trump. The voter-intimidation operation apparently used email addresses obtained from state voter registration lists, which include party affiliation and home addresses and can include email addresses and phone numbers. Those addresses were then used in an apparently widespread targeted spamming operation. The senders claimed they would know which candidate the recipient was voting for in the Nov. 3 election, for which early voting is ongoing. Host Brian Kilmeade noted on Thursday that “both Russian President Vladimir Putin and Iran have denied any involvement in this.” “We’re taking major steps to protect the elections,” O'Brien said. I’ve held over 20 high-level meetings here at the White House with The National Security Council.” “The Department of Homeland Security is working with our 50 secretary of states across the country,” he continued. “We have National Guard stood up with their cyber units.” He also noted that “We spent hundreds of millions of federal dollars helping secretaries of state and lieutenant governors, who manage their elections out in their states, harden their infrastructure.” “So across the country, we’re making big efforts to ensure that our election infrastructure is hardened and that people when they go out to vote, they know their vote’s going to be counted,” he added. On Wednesday, noting that his agency was responsible for investigating election crimes, Director Christopher Wray vowed to take action in order to ensure the integrity of U.S. elections. He said that Americans should be ""confident"" that their votes count. “The good news is we’re so decentralized,” O'Brien said, explaining that “95% of the ballots that are cast have some sort of paper analog so that they can be audited.” “It’s very difficult for an adversary to actually change the outcome of the elections, and we’ve been doing everything we can to make sure that’s the case on Election Day, that no one can play with the tallies, with the votes as they come in,” he continued.",20,3.3178645850266615,1.5115467347682914,1.80631785025837,17

Reaction from Bramer Group chair Don Bramer. Targeting millions of voters with misinformation may be as easy as clicking the right button in 2020. The Fox News Investigative Unit has been made aware of a digital marketplace where anyone with enough cash can apparently purchase the kind of detailed data about U.S. voters that could lead to the sorts of targeted campaigns the and the Director of National Intelligence are now attributing to Iran and Russia. The listing for the data itself is on the dark web, a version of the internet that is invisible to normal search browsers, but that is available to anyone with the right tools. ""The sellers of the U.S. voter database claim that it includes 186 million records, and if that is correct, that means it includes information about nearly all voters in the U.S."" The Russian and Iranian campaigns apparently resulted in emails being sent to Democrats in battleground states like Florida, Arizona and Pennsylvania, and contained threatening messages designed to intimidate voters. , : John Ratcliffe confirmed during a press conference that both of those foreign nations are in possession of some U.S. voter data, and are attempting to exercise their influence ahead of the election. Ratcliffe is now being called upon to brief all members of the Senate about the announcement. The apparent voter information in this alleged marketplace has zero impact on peoples’ ability to cast ballots, or the integrity of the voting system as a whole. Much of the information also resembles the kind of legitimate consumer data sets that are bought and sold for advertising purposes. However, the extent of what is available in this obviously more illicit marketplace is eye-opening. And the implications of having this type of information available for anyone to purchase may now be even more obvious given what Iran and Russia are alleged to have been doing. The particular listing of personal data-for-purchase that was flagged to Fox has apparently been sitting out in the open for weeks, and remains available for anyone to buy - even today. - , In the screenshot below, which purports to show the listing, the vendor alleges to have highly specific information about “up to 180 million U.S. users from all 50 states.” The Fox News Investigative Unit has been made aware of a dark web marketplace where anyone with enough cash can purchase the kind of detailed information about voters that would be necessary to conduct the kinds of targeted misinformation campaigns being attributed to Iran and Russia by and . ) It further describes exactly what kind of “details, demographic and marketing data” is provided for each person, including “Facebook , Phone, email address, name, address, city, state, zip, voter information – political party preferences” and much, much more. The apparent seller notes that the information can be bought as a whole, or individually by state. According to Vinny Troia, of cybersecurity company Night Lion and the person who flagged the listing to Fox News, the information goes further than just politics. It includes mortgage lender information, the types of credit cards someone uses, and even possibly details about peoples’ children. ""There are a number of different online vendors that sell this type of data,"" Troia told Fox. Lately, he added, ""there’s been a massive influx of new players appearing and data going up for sale due to the upcoming election."" Even Troia admits that while awareness is high, ""law enforcement are short on time and resources to track and remove all the different sources as they pop up."" Troia shared another document, which Fox is unable to independently verify, that appears to show what one of these listings actually looks like. It contains a variety of information about the individual listed, including their first and last names, date of birth, and city of residence, but also credit card types, mortgage lender and marital status. There are no voter or political registration details, but there is plenty of other data in the listing. The Fox News Investigative Unit was shown what appears to be the personal information of a voter that was taken from an online database available for purchase on the dark web. ) Another cybersecurity firm, Trustwave, reported similar findings to Troia's on October 21, and added that it believes the problem may be even larger. ""The sellers of the U.S. voter database [analyzed by Trustwave] claim that it includes 186 million records, and if that is correct, that means it includes information about nearly all voters in the U.S.,"" Trustwave wrote in its report. The company added that it’s not only voters whose data is being bought and sold. ""The U.S. consumer database is claimed to include 245 million records,” Trustwave wrote, “which is nearly the entire population."" ""There are a number of different online vendors that sell this type of data and lately, there’s been a massive influx... due to the upcoming election. It’s not hard to find if you know where to look but law enforcement are short on time and resources..."" ""So for now, voter and marketing data is easily purchased and records contain hundreds or thousands of data points,"" Troia lamented, while also noting the practice is ""virtually impossible to stop. Breached data sets keep getting recycled and re-packaged for new purposes."" And the hacker community is just the tip of the iceberg, Troia says. ""Ultimately, the responsibility falls on organizations that leave this information unsecured while continuing to act as brokers to other organizations wanting to purchase that data,"" he told Fox.",20,3.449823354561522,3.4795044783539493,-0.02968112379242749,17

President Trump hinted Friday that Christopher Wray’s role as director could be in jeopardy following his testimony before Congress earlier this week regarding Russian election interference and domestic security threats. “We’re looking at a lot of different things,” Trump told reporters at the White House when asked if he could look to replace Wray. “I did not like his answers yesterday and I’m not sure he liked them either. I’m sure that he probably would agree with me.” Wray has served as director since May 2017, when he replaced James Comey. The president took issue with remarks Wray made before the House Homeland Security Committee on Thursday. During the hearing, Wray said Antifa was a “real thing,” but told lawmakers he defined it as “a movement or an ideology” rather than an organized group. Trump has blamed Antifa for recent violence in several major cities and said he intends to designate it as a terrorist organization. “We have quite a number -- and I've said this quite consistently since my first time appearing before this committee -- we have any number of properly predicated investigations into what we would describe as violent anarchist extremists and some of those individuals self-identify with Antifa,” Wray told the committee. He added the individuals who identify with the Antifa movement were ""coalescing regionally into what you might describe as small groups or nodes"" that are under investigation. Wray also told the committee that the had evidence that Russia was engaged in a “very active” effort to interfere with the upcoming presidential election with an apparent goal “to denigrate Vice President Biden.” Trump told reporters that he “disagreed” with Wray on both points. “Obviously China is at the top of the list and I think Russia and North Korea and many other countries can be talked about, but China would be at the top of that list, so I don’t know why that’s not mentioned,” Trump said. The president added that Antifa had “hurt a lot of people.”",20,2.81145581692283,2.339306097023802,0.4721497198990279,5

Jack Keane on ‘Fox News @ Night.’ Director Christopher Wray testified before the House Homeland Security Committee Thursday, detailing a number of domestic and foreign threats presently facing the nation, notably including the continued threat of Russian election interference. Wray told the committee that while he has not seen the same level of interference by the Kremlin as in 2016, there is evidence that Russia has been “very active” in its interference efforts, and that it appears to favor President Trump. “The intelligence community’s consensus is that Russia continues to try to influence our elections primarily through what we would call malign foreign influence,” Wray said, “as opposed to what we saw in 2016 where there was also an effort to target election infrastructure – you know, cyber-target.” A 2019 Senate Intelligence Committee report revealed that there was evidence that Russia targeted election infrastructure in every state going into the 2016 election but said no votes were altered. : ' A ,' “We have not seen that second part yet this year or this cycle,” Wray continued, “but we certainly have seen very active — very active — efforts by the Russians to influence our election in 2020 through what I would call more the malign foreign influence side of things: social media, use of proxies, state media, online journal, etc., in effort to both sow divisiveness and discord and – and I think the intelligence community has assessed this publicly — primarily to denigrate Vice President Biden and what the Russians see is kind of an anti-Russian establishment.” Russia is not the only known foreign threat when it comes to election interference. The intelligence community has warned that Iran wants to “undermine” Trump. Officials also said that China “prefers” that Trump “does not win reelection” in November. Bejing prefers a Trump loss because Chinese officials view him as unpredictable, said Bill Evanina, the director of the National Counterintelligence and Security Center.

They are a serious national security threat, but day in, day out, the threats that we face from China are significantly greater,"" Ratcliffe said. ""Anyone who says otherwise is just politicizing intelligence for their own narrative."" House Intelligence Committee Chair Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., said that House members on his panel would receive the in-person briefings, noting that Ratcliffe’s announcement came after ""extensive public criticism."" “This morning, after extensive public criticism, the Office of Director of National Intelligence committed to providing the canceled in-person briefing to both the House and Senate Intelligence Committees,” Schiff said in a statement. “But these briefings for the intelligence committees must not obviate the need to keep all Members and the American people appropriately and accurately informed about the active threats to the November election,” he added.

2020-09-15,Fox,https://www.foxnews.com/tech/air-force-bomb-f-35-tracks-destroys-targets-40-miles,New F-35-dropped Air Force bomb tracks and destroys targets from 40 miles,"The Air Force is preparing to arm its F-35 with a new, all-weather course-correcting air-dropped precision bomb able to destroy moving targets from distances as far as 40 miles. It uses a data link and multi-mode targeting seeker to follow targets through fog, rain or dust from great distances. The service recently completed a ""captive carry"" test of the bomb's technologies on an F-35 to prepare for full integration into the stealth fighter. The ""Stormbreaker"" weapon, slated to operate on the F-35 by 2023, was previously known as the Small Diameter Bomb . It is expected to inspire new Air Force tactical and strategic adjustments by virtue of introducing previously impossible attack possibilities. The Stormbreaker : 155 Some of the innovations built into the weapon are naturally designed to help the Air Force stay in front of major power rivals, many of whom have spent years engineering technologies to ""counter"" U.S. weapons. Russia and China, for instance, are known to have studied U.S. weapons systems for years with the specific purpose of finding ways to destroy, disable and counter them in war. It is part of a well-known cycle of great power military competition, wherein each power works vigorously to stay in front of potential rivals through various innovations, upgrades and new technical applications. Air Force and industry efforts to stay in front of great power competitors with upgraded weapons and advanced technologies are often intended to “counter” enemy “countermeasures.” Weapons developers, who engineer radar systems, sensors and weapons such as the -9X, Stormbreaker and -120D, explain that major rival adversaries have now spent years studying U.S. weapons with the aim of building technologies to outmatch them. : - This scenario, therefore, requires a calculated and highly advanced response, often resulting in weapons upgrades. Raytheon's technical adjustments and modernization initiatives with the Stormbreaker air-dropped weapon, for instance, incorporate a few upgrades and “countermeasure” improvements designed to outmatch enemy attacks. The Stormbreaker, slated to arm Air Force F-35s by 2023, relies upon all-weather stand-off precision-strike capability and a “tri-mode” seeker to track and destroy moving targets at ranges up to 40-miles. A data link built into the Stormbreaker, Raytheon developers say, enables the weapon to receive “in-flight” target updates, change course in response to new intelligence and exchange data both to and from the host aircraft. The Stormbreaker can rely upon all-weather millimeter wave sensing, imaging infrared guidance or semi-active laser targeting, depending upon the requirements of a given attack mission. , Raytheon and the Air Force recently completed a successful “captive carry” test of the seeker on an F-35 designed to integrate the new weapon onto the fifth-generation fighter. Not only will Stormbreaker allow for greater stand-off ranges and attacks in adverse weather conditions which might otherwise obscure or complicate targeting, but it is also engineered with the data-exchanges necessary to support the Air Force’s Air Dominance concept based on sharing information in combat to increase lethality. Raytheon’s effort to engineer a new sensor able to exchange in-flight information through a data link introduces new multi-mode detection possibilities built into a single weapon. For example, a data link used with Stormbreaker could bring great tactical relevance when it comes to weapons needing course-correcting targeting guidance enabled by all-weather millimeter wave radar. In these scenarios, millimeter wave radar would bring an expanded targeting envelope to air-attack possibilities. Millimeter wave could enable the delivery of precision effects in the kinds of adverse weather conditions known to complicate other sensors such as often used laser-guidance, infrared detection or electro-optical cameras. Laser signals, while extremely precise and used regularly to great effect to designate enemy targets, can at times suffer what’s called “beam attenuation” due to smoke, fog or other weather impediments. An interesting essay – ""Through Fog High Resolution Imaging Using Millimeter Wave Radar” from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign – on this topic states that “cameras or LiDARs suffer in low visibility conditions and bad weather. Cameras also suffer at night in low light conditions… Millimeter wave radars offer more favorable characteristics due to their ability to work at night and penetrate through fog, snow and dust.” Thermal imaging can also decrease in effectiveness due to dense fog, the essay adds. As part of yet another effort to prevent enemy countermeasures, Raytheon’s upgraded -9X uses advanced “ spectrum seekers” to counter enemy efforts to block, confuse or thwart targeting. Spectrum seekers can enable frequency changes or ""hopping"" to make fast adjustments if one frequency is jammed. In effect, weapons upgrades are designed to “counter” an enemy's “counter,” thereby increasing the prospect of a successful strike. The -9X is also engineered to align with the Air Force strategy with its “off-boresight” targeting technology, an integrated sensor and thrust-vector system that enables the pilot to destroy otherwise “out-of-view” enemy targets behind or beside the aircraft. By drawing upon an advanced sensing network that includes 360-degree cameras and a helmet-mounted cueing system, pilots can find and attack enemy fighters approaching from behind, without having to reposition into a more linear, or straight-on line-of-sight attack posture.",49,6.299337061228478,6.7234924854036295,-0.42415542417515173,22

2020-08-21,Fox,https://www.foxnews.com/us/former-green-beret-charged-espionage-with-russia,Former Green Beret charged spying for Russia,", Va. — A former Army Green Beret living in northern Virginia was arrested Friday, charged with divulging military secrets about his unit's activities in former Soviet republics during more than a decade of contacts with Russian intelligence. Peter Rafael Dzibinski Debbins, 45, told Russian intelligence he considered himself a “son of Russia,” according to an indictment made public after his arrest. ' ' , ' ' “Debbins thought that the United States was too dominant in the world and needed to be cut down to size,” prosecutors alleged. The indictment also states that Debbins was motivated in part because of bitterness over his Army career and a desire to establish business contacts in Russia. The espionage took place from 1996 to 2011, prosecutors say. The case against Debbins is the second Justice Department prosecution announced this week accusing a government or military official of transmitting U.S. secrets to a foreign country. The other case, in Hawaii, charged a former officer with spying for China. , , The two prosecutions “demonstrate that we must remain vigilant against espionage from our two most malicious adversaries — Russia and China,” Assistant Attorney General John Demers, the Justice Department’s top national security official, said in a statement. Debbins’ mother was born in the Soviet Union, and Debbins met his wife in the Russian city of Chelyabinsk, where they were married in 1997, according to the indictment. . Debbins, of Gainesville, allegedly met Russian intelligence beginning in 1996, when he was an student at the University of Minnesota, through 2011. As far back as 1997, he was even assigned a code name by Russian intelligence agents — Ikar Lesnikov — after signing a statement saying that he wanted to serve Russia, according to prosecutors. Debbins received nominal payments for his information, even though he initially refused the money. In one meeting with Russian intelligence, he accepted a bottle of Cognac and a Russian military uniform as payment, according to the indictment. “When service members collude to provide classified information to our foreign adversaries, they betray the oaths they swore to their country and their fellow service members,"" said G. Zachary Terwilliger, U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, whose office is prosecuting the case. ""As this indictment reflects, we will be steadfast and dogged in holding such individuals accountable.” Debbins, who was arrested Friday, will have an initial court appearance on Monday. Online court records remained sealed, so it was unclear whether Debbins has an attorney. He is charged under the Espionage Act with providing national defense information to those not entitled to receive it. He could face up to life in prison. Debbins held Secret and later Top Secret security clearances during the time of his criminal conduct, and served in the Army Special Forces, according to the indictment. The indictment alleges Debbins' espionage began in late 1996 when he gave one of his Russian handlers the names of four Catholic nuns he had visited while in Russia. 'S He was assigned to a chemical unit in South Korea in 1998 and 1999, and the indictment says he provided his Russian handlers information about that deployment. He later deployed with his Special Forces unit to Azerbaijan and Georgia. He also allegedly provided information and names of his fellow Special Forces members. On multiple occasions, the Russian handlers asked Debbins for U.S. military field manuals. Debbins explained that he was unable to provide them because he believed that carrying the manuals would prompt Homeland Security to stop him at the airport and seize his electronic devices. This booking photo provided by the Alexandria, Va, Sheriff's Office, shows Peter Debbins, a former Army Green Beret, who was arrested Friday, Aug. 21, 2020, for allegedly conspiring with Russian intelligence operatives to provide them with United States national defense information. The indictment states that Debbins lost his security clearance and command of his unit for an unspecified security violation in 2004 or 2005, and then left the military in 2005 with an honorable discharge. He worked from 2005 through 2010 in Minnesota for a Ukrainian steel manufacturer and a transportation company. His security clearance was restored in 2010 by an Army adjudicator, according to the indictment, though the reinstatement came with a warning that his family and business connections to Russia might make him ”the target of a foreign intelligence service."" Debbins had told his Russian handlers as far back as 1997 that he wanted to leave the military, but they encouraged him to stay. They also encouraged his decision to join the Special Forces, saying “he was of no use to the Russian intelligence service as an infantry commander.” According to the indictment, military officers questioned Debbins about his travel after visits to Russia in 2000 and 2003, but he failed to disclose his interactions with Russian intelligence. The court papers do not explain what led prosecutors to bring charges now or how he came to be under criminal investigation.",20,4.575953645355613,4.502024012874204,0.07392963248140827,27
2020-08-09,Fox,https://www.foxnews.com/media/nsa-adviser-robert-obrien-steps-free-fair-elections,NSA Adviser Robert O'Brien outlines steps US taking to maintain free and fair elections,"Washington Examiner chief congressional correspondent Susan Ferrechio says she thinks President Trump helped his chances for re-election by signing these coronavirus stimulus executive orders on Saturday because he took action in an emergency when Congress wouldn't act, which will resonate with voters. “There will be severe consequences with any country that attempts to interfere with our free and fair elections,” National Security Adviser Robert O'Brien said on Sunday in his first interview since recovering from the novel coronavirus. O'Brien told ’ “Face The Nation” on Sunday that he has” recovered fully” from -19. “I am very, very grateful,” O'Brien said. “I was blessed and had a light case.” He added that -19 is “a tough thing” and “a nasty virus,” which has “done great damage to our country.” “My heart goes out to the folks who didn't make it. I was fortunate, but there are a lot of people who didn't make it,” he said. “There are a lot of people who are suffering greatly as a result of this virus and having been through this. My heart really goes out to them.” O'Brien returned to work at the White House last week after contracting a “mild” case of coronavirus after two negative -19 tests in a row and a week of being asymptomatic. On Sunday, host Margaret Brennan noted that “Congress and the White House were unable to come to this agreement on more funding for things,” including “a boost to election security funding that Democrats were asking for,” referencing the stalled negotiations in the Senate on Phase 4 coronavirus relief. She then pointed out that “this country has never voted in a pandemic” and asked O'Brien, “Don't you need a boost to election security for states across this country? Don't you need more money before November?” “We're working on that with Congress,” he said in response. When asked if he expects a bill to pass before November O'Brien said, “I hope so.” “I want to make it clear there's been no administration that's done more for election security than this administration,” he said. O'Brien then outlined the measure the National Security Council has been taking to protect the upcoming election. “We've been putting hundreds of millions of dollars into election security at the . We've been running a policy coordination process for months and months and months on election security, we're working with [Department of Homeland Security], we're working with secretaries of state across the country,” O'Brien said. “There's no higher concern that we have than maintaining the free and fair elections that are the cornerstone of our democracy.” He acknowledged that “the Chinese, the Iranians, the Russians” and others “would like to interfere with our democracy,” saying, “We're going to fight against that. We're going to take every step necessary to harden our election infrastructure, harden our cyber infrastructure and protect our elections a hundred percent.” Late last month the Office of the Director of National Intelligence issued a press release that said, “Today, we see our adversaries seeking to compromise the private communications of U.S. political campaigns, candidates and other political targets.” “Our adversaries also seek to compromise our election infrastructure, and we continue to monitor malicious cyber actors trying to gain access to U.S. state and federal networks, including those responsible for managing elections,” the release continued. Brennan said that the language in the release “sounds an awful lot like what Russia did back in 2016, but now it's happening on your watch so what are you doing to stop it?” “What we're doing is we've got our cyber teams in place,” O'Brien responded. “ is working very hard to track down those malign actors.” He went on to say that “we know it's China” and Russia are who are trying “to access secretary of state websites and that sort of thing and collect data on Americans and engage and influence operations, whether it's on TikTok or Twitter and other spaces.” He acknowledged that “it's a real concern.” O'Brien also noted that the Chinese don't want President Trump to be reelected because “he's been tougher on China than any president in history and we're standing up for the first time [to] the Chinese Communist Party and protecting Americans, protecting our , protecting our economy, protecting our vaccine data.” O'Brien said “we’re aware” that “China, like Russia, like Iran, have engaged in cyber-attacks and phishing and that sort of thing with respect to our election infrastructure, with respect to websites.” “We're taking steps to counter it, whether it's China or Russia, Iran, we're not going to put up with it,” he said, adding that “there will be severe consequences” for “any country that attempts to interfere with our free and fair elections.” He said that steps to “harden” election infrastructure in the U.S. include, “pumping money into the states” and ’ “massive program,” which is running “to keep our elections free and fair.” “We're not going to have foreign countries deciding who our next president is going to be. That's outrageous,” he went on to say. O'Brien also noted that “no administration has been tougher on the Russians” and that the U.S. has “sanctioned hundreds of Russian entities.” “There's almost nothing we can sanction left of the Russians,” he said. “We put so many sanctions on the Russians that, by the way the prior administration didn't do.”",20,3.1380841672516695,2.9504973040127314,0.18758686323893814,5

Reaction from Johns Hopkins University's Wendy Osefu and American Conservative Union chair Matt Schlapp. A number of the forces will go to Italy, while the headquarters of the U.S. European Command and Special Operations Command Europe will be relocated from Stuttgart, Germany, to Belgium. Esper told reporters Wednesday that the movements – which will cost in the “single-digit” billions of dollars – will keep about 24,000 troops in Germany and shift other forces further east into the Black Sea and Baltic regions. Some of the troops returning stateside will later conduct rotational deployments “back to Europe,” he added. Germany is a hub for U.S. operations in the Middle East and Africa. The decision to keep nearly half of the 12,000 affected troops in Europe, the Associated Press says, is a clear move by the Pentagon to assuage allies by avoiding their complete withdrawal from the region. And by spreading forces into the east, it sends a message to Russia that the U.S. is not reducing its commitment to the region and remains ready to protect Eastern Europe from any Moscow aggression. Sen. Jim Inhofe, the Republican chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, has voiced support for the plan while also acknowledging it will take “months to plan and years to execute.” He was briefed on the issue last week, and he issued a statement saying the “concept for realigning U.S. military posture in Europe” is sound. In this 2011 file photo, the German and U.S. flags fly on a lamp post in front of the White House in Washington ahead of German Chancellor Angela Merkel's visit. Defense officials say the U.S. will pull 12,000 troops from Germany, bringing 6,400 forces home and shifting 5,600 to other countries in Europe, including Italy and Belgium. The plan will cost billions of dollars and take years to complete. ’S ‘’ But members of Trump’s own political party have criticized the troop move as a gift to Russia and a threat to U.S. national security. Twenty-two Republicans on the House Armed Services Committee recently wrote a letter to Trump saying a reduced U.S. commitment to Europe’s defense would encourage Russian aggression and opportunism. Trump announced last month that he wanted to cut the number of active-duty U.S. troops in Germany from roughly 36,000 to fewer than 25,000. Shifting forces out of the country had long been rumored and is in line with the Pentagon's efforts to put more troops in the Indo-Pacific. The president on Wednesday indicated the move was tied more directly to his anger over Germany’s failure to meet defense spending goals. “We’re reducing the force because they’re not paying their bills. It’s very simple. They’re delinquent,” the president told reporters outside the White House, adding that he might rethink the decision to pull troops out of Germany ""if they start paying their bills.” In this 2015 file photo, an airplane lands at the Air Base in Ramstein, Germany. Trump has branded Germany “delinquent” for failing to meet a goal set in 2014 for members to halt budget cuts and move toward spending at least 2 percent of their gross national product on defense by 2024. He asserted that the Germans had long shortchanged the United States on trade and defense, declaring that “until they pay” more for their own defense, he will reduce U.S. troops. Overall, the U.S. has about 47,000 troops and civilian personnel in Germany, spread out across a number of bases, headquarters and smaller installations. Most of the 36,000 on active duty are in a handful of larger Army and Air Force bases, including Ramstein Air Base, a hub in the region. There also are 2,600 National Guard and Reserve forces in Germany and almost 12,000 civilians working for the services or the Defense Department.

Devin Nunes and former officer Bryan Dean Wright. The Office of the Director of National Intelligence warned Friday that adversaries like China, Russia and Iran are “seeking to compromise” private communications of U.S. political campaigns, candidates and other political targets to influence the 2020 election. Director of the National Counterintelligence and Security Center Bill Evanina on Friday said election security “remains a top priority” for the intelligence community, while identifying specific foreign actors that pose the largest threat. - Evanina noted that at this point, adversaries are working to compromise “private communications” of presidential and other campaigns, candidates and political targets, as well as compromise election infrastructure. Director of the National Counterintelligence and Security Center Bill Evanina. “We continue to monitor malicious cyber actors trying to gain access to U.S. state and federal networks, including those responsible for managing elections,” he said, while noting that the “diversity” of election systems in states makes “it extraordinarily difficult for foreign adversaries to broadly disrupt or change vote tallies without detection.” Evanina also added that, as in 2016, foreign nations are continuing to use influence measures on social and traditional media “in an effort to sway U.S. voters’ preferences and perspectives, to shift U.S. policies, to increase discord and to undermine confidence in our democratic process.” Evanina, though, said at this point, is “primarily concerned” with China, Russia and Iran -- while noting that other nation states and non-state actors could “also do harm to our electoral process.” China, according to Evanina, is working to influence and shape policy in the U.S., and recognizes that its efforts may “affect the presidential race.” As for Russia, which was at the center of U.S. election interference in 2016, Evanina said its “persistent objective” is to “weaken” the U.S. Evanina said the Kremlin is using a range of efforts, including Internet trolls and other proxies, to “spread disinformation in the United States that is designed to undermine confidence in our democratic process and denigrate what it sees as an anti-Russia ‘establishment’ in America.” Evanina also said Iran is seeking to undermine U.S. democratic institutions, warning that their efforts are centered around online influence, such as spreading disinformation on social media and recirculating anti-U.S. content. ‘’ 2016 : “As Americans, we are all in this together; our elections should be our own. Foreign efforts to influence or interfere with our elections are a direct threat to the fabric of our democracy,” he continued. “Neutralizing these threats requires not just a whole-of-government approach, but a whole-of-nation effort.” Evanina’s warning comes as he has been providing “robust intelligence-based briefings” on election security to presidential campaigns, political committees, and congressional audiences. Evanina was tapped in May to handle briefing presidential candidates, their campaigns and major political parties on election security threats. The defensive briefings from the intelligence community come after it was determined from U.S. intelligence agencies that Russia interfered in the 2016 election. Intelligence officials have said that Russia interfered through social media campaigns and through stealing and distributing emails from Democratic accounts. The intelligence community has long maintained that Russia was trying to boost Donald Trump’s campaign and add chaos to the American political process. Special counsel Robert Mueller concluded that Russian interference was “sweeping and systematic,” but he did not find a criminal conspiracy between Russia and the Trump campaign.",20,3.752702564772069,2.7832982016914922,0.9694043630805766,17

Russian cyber hackers are targeting organizations involved in coronavirus vaccine development, security officials in the U.S., United Kingdom and Canada claimed Thursday. The British National Cyber Security Centre published an advisory detailing the activity of the threat group known as 29, which “has exploited organizations globally.” The assessed that 29, also named “the Dukes” or “Cozy Bear,” almost certainly operate as part of Russian Intelligence Services. The assessment is supported by partners at the Canadian Communication Security Establishment , the U.S. Department of Homeland Security , the Cybersecurity Infrastructure Security Agency and the National Security Agency . : , “It is completely unacceptable that the Russian Intelligence Services are targeting those working to combat the coronavirus pandemic,'' U.K.'s Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said in a statement. “While others pursue their selfish interests with reckless behavior, the U.K. and its allies are getting on with the hard work of finding a vaccine and protecting global health.'' The made the announcement in a press release, where it claimed “29’s campaign of malicious activity is ongoing, predominantly against government, diplomatic, think-tank, health care and energy targets to steal valuable intellectual property.” “We condemn these despicable attacks against those doing vital work to combat the coronavirus pandemic,” Paul Chichester, 's director of operations, said in a statement. “Working with our allies, the is committed to protecting our most critical assets and our top priority at this time is to protect the health sector.""

Is it realistic to expect a vaccine by the end of 2020? Fox News medical contributor Dr. Janette Nesheiwat weighs in. The persistent and ongoing attacks are seen by intelligence officials as an effort to steal intellectual property, rather than to disrupt research. It was unclear whether any information actually was stolen but the British center says individuals’ confidential information is not believed to have been compromised. Cozy Bear, also known as ""the Dukes,"" has been identified by Washington as one of two Russian government-linked hacking groups that broke into the Democratic National Committee computer network and stole emails ahead of the 2016 presidential election.

The operations came after President Trump gave the “sweeping authorization” in 2018 by signing a ""presidential finding,"" according to Yahoo News, citing U.S. officials with knowledge of the matter. With a presidential finding, the president authorizes covert action necessary to support “identifiable foreign policy objectives"" that are deemed ""important to the national security of the United States,” according to a U.S. government document. 15 The authorization undoes “many restrictions that had been in place under prior administrations,” and gives the more leeway in authorizing its own covert cyber operations, the Yahoo News report said. Countries mentioned as possible targets include Russia, China, Iran and North Korea. “The White House wanted a vehicle to strike back. And this was the way to do it,” the report added, quoting a former U.S. government official. The new powers gave the more latitude to “damage adversaries’ critical infrastructure, such as petrochemical plants, and to engage in the kind of hack-and-dump operations that Russian hackers and WikiLeaks popularized,” the report explained. The hack-and-dump tactic involves leaking stolen documents or data to journalists or posting it on the Internet. Initially, the Obama administration considered retaliating against Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election by using hack-and-dump but, in the end, the was told to “stand down,” the report stated.

Devin Nunes reacts to brief on Russian bounties: Vladimir Putin is 'dangerous,' intel community has 'real problem'","California Congressman Devin Nunes weighs in after the ‘Gang of Eight’ is briefed by intelligence chiefs on Russia bounty allegations on ‘Fox and Friends Weekend.’ There is a ""real problem"" in the U.S. intelligence community if the leakers are going to have to investigate themselves, Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., pointed out Saturday. In an interview on ""Fox & Friends Weekend,"" Nunes reacted after attending a classified briefing on Thursday with congressional leaders -- including the “Gang of Eight” -- and the country's top intelligence officials amid demands for more information on reports that Russian agents offered Taliban-linked militants in Afghanistan thousands of dollars in bounties for killing American troops. ""What can you tell us about what you were briefed on and did what you were briefed on warrant, in your opinion, a response?"" asked host Griff Jenkins.

Russian authorities seem to be pulling out all the stops to get people to vote on a series of constitutional amendments that would enable President Vladimir Putin to stay in office until 2036 by resetting the clock on his term limits. Nunes replied with little information about the reports themselves, but noted that it is ""no secret"" that Russian President Vladimir Putin is ""a dangerous person"" who has ""got a very powerful intelligence force"" and is ""knocking people off"" across the globe. ""And, the way I look at this is the intelligence agencies have been politicized since at least 2016,"" he stated. ""We know that because the Clinton campaign was able to run a dirty operation to actually spy on the Trump campaign and effectively the Republican Party."" The House Intelligence Committee Ranking Member told Jenkins that these reports have ""all the same hallmarks"" as those surrounding the ""impeachment hoax"" and the ""whistleblowers"" who ""had actually been coordinating with the Democratic Party."" ""It's the same reporters [who] ran with it and then, you know, it stretched out. At first, it’s a bombshell. And then, of course, after a few days you figure out the intelligence never even made its way to the president's desk,"" he recounted. Nunes added that when there are threats to U.S. troops -- corroborated or not -- it is imperative that intelligence officials circulate that intel to U.S. forces. At which point they can they do the work of verifying its truth. ""The idea that this would leak likely -- and I'll say this, and I think this is the most important thing I'm going to say this morning -- this leak probably came from the area of our intelligence agencies that look at counterintelligence...these are the very people that are actually going to be investigating themselves,"" he remarked.

Rep. Jim Banks pushed back on House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s criticism of President Trump’s response to the Russian bounty report, saying that the call was made by “career intelligence officers.” “I don’t know if Speaker Pelosi realizes it or not but, she is not attacking President Trump, she’s attacking career intelligence officers who determined that this intelligence didn’t rise to the level of being reputable enough to brief the president on it,” Banks, R-Ind., told “America’s Newsroom.” Banks said that it “must be recognized” that if a president made a decision based on “bad intelligence,” there would be ""severe consequences.” “At the end of the day, we have to allow our intelligence officials to do their job, Trust the men and women who serve to protect America every day and the intelligence community. They made this call. Not appointed political officers in the administration.” ‘’ Banks' comments came after Pelosi and the top bipartisan congressional leaders, known as the Gang of Eight, received a classified briefing Thursday on reports of Russian bounties on U.S. troops serving in Afghanistan, which was first revealed by the New York Times. The intelligence assessment reached the White House, the president's written daily brief and the National Security Council and was even shared with the British government since its troops were also targeted, the newspaper reported. When asked Thursday if the Gang of Eight had also been briefed, Pelosi said they should have been. ""I didn’t know about it,"" Pelosi said at her weekly press conference at the Capitol. ""But I will say this: It was of a consequential level that the intelligence community should have brought it to us in that way.""

2020-07-02,Fox,https://www.foxnews.com/world/russian-military-intelligence-unit-insurgents-kill-americans-afghanistan,Behind the top-secret Russian military intelligence unit accused of paying insurgents to kill Americans in Afghanistan,"Some call it ""Putin's assassination squad."" Some say, ""Russian killing squad."" In any case, there is a Russian clandestine military intelligence unit known as the 29155, and it is believed to behind a string of scandals – most recently, a reported scheme to pay bounties to Afghan insurgents to kill U.S. troops. So what exactly is the shadowy assemblage? ""There's no real U.S. analog. It's like a mix of and special forces,"" Matthew Schmidt, associate professor of national security at the University of New Haven, told Fox News. ""It's trained to make mayhem. The overall goal is to destabilize targeted political systems, including in Europe, to attack the political will to maintain , with other missions as opportunity allows, including the killing of traitors."" Ultimately, experts and analysts define it as something of an elite squad tasked with sabotage and targeted assassinations. In this June 16, 2018 file photo, Taliban fighters gather with residents to celebrate a three-day cease fire marking the Islamic holiday of Eid al-Fitr, in Nangarhar province, east of Kabul, Afghanistan. Unit 29155 operates under Russia's umbrella intelligence agency the , officially termed the Main Directorate of the General Staff, which formed after the folding of the Soviet-era . This specialized outfit is believed to have been birthed around 2008, two years after Russian President Putin legalized targeted killings on foreign soil and in the aftermath of Russia's invasion of Georgia that same year. ' ' While it is unclear exactly how many operatives make up the unit, reports indicate that some involved have decades of experiences beneath their belt – dating back to the ultimately failed Soviet incursion into Afghanistan in the 1980s. While it is unclear exactly when in recent years 29155 came onto the radar of Western intelligence, the Russian Defense Ministry is said to have lavished bonuses and praise on the team in 2012, and the Unit commander Maj. Gen Andrei Vladimirovich Averyanov – a veteran of the Chechen wars, starting in 1994 and 1999 respectively – was awarded the esteemed Hero of Russia medal in 2015, according to Business Insider. It is also suspected that 29155 played a pivotal part in Russia's 2014 takeover of Ukraine's Crimea region, both through propaganda and media efforts and in the notion of ""little green men"" – as described to Fox News by locals – that mysteriously popped up in the peninsula ahead of the highly controversial annexation. In this file photo taken on Wednesday, June 24, 2020, Russian President Vladimir Putin, center, watches the Victory Day military parade marking the 75th anniversary of the Nazi defeat in Moscow. Russian authorities seem to be pulling out all the stops to get people to vote on a series of constitutional amendments that would enable President Vladimir Putin to stay in office until 2036 by resetting the clock on his term limits. However, 29155 has spread its wings well beyond Eastern Europe in recent times. The division is alleged to have been behind two 2015 attempts to assassinate Emilian Gebrev, a Bulgarian arms manufacturer, through poisoning. The following year, the unit was implicated for having likely orchestrated a botched coup in Montenegro, which entailed taking out Prime Minister Milo Djukanovic. And in 2018, U.K. officials pointed fingers at unit members as having carried out an assassination pursuit – using a nerve agent – on defected Russian spy Sergei V. Skirpal. In 2019, French officials reportedly unearthed a clandestine base in the Alps, used to execute regional missions, on the heels of media reports that the Unit was videoed giving a retired military leader a wad of cash in Serbia. Spanish officials have also blamed the 29155 of rousing the Catalan independence push, which started in 2010 and gained momentum following a referendum in November 2014. German leaders are also wary of foul play by the group on their soil – and subsequently expelled two Russian diplomats late last year over the audacious murder of a Georgian man in Berlin. The unit is assumed to sometimes operate under diplomatic cover abroad. But in regards to Afghanistan, U.S. intelligence is still trying to piece together the extent to which the assumed bounty operations were conducted. But according to multiple defense sources who spoke to Fox News on the condition of anonymity, there is some skepticism and questions as to whether it is being blown out of proportion. ""It's being portrayed that the Russians paid the Taliban to hit coalition forces, especially Americans. But whenever you have an operation using proxies, money is going to be involved,"" said one insider. ""And it definitely shows that there are people in the intelligence community that are willing to leak information even if it is unverified. Clearly, that was done for political purposes."" U.S. troops patrol at an Afghan National Army Base in Logar province, Afghanistan August 7, 2018. /Omar Sobhani - 1D8EB3A110 A former Afghan military official also told Fox News that mercenary-type activities are nothing unprecedented into the bloodied nation, although this unit in-particular has ostensibly gone under the radar for some time. Indeed, Russian meddling in U.S. interests inside the country is also hardly new, with evidence surfacing in 2017 that Moscow was arming the Taliban. The Kremlin has openly advocated its support of any group fighting – which the Taliban has done – but denied any weapons transfers. The Trump administration has mostly rebuffed the story as not being credible, with national security advisor Robert O'Brien telling Fox News on Wednesday that ""the president's career briefer decided not to brief him because it was unverified intelligence."" So what is Putin's play in Russia all about? ""The goal is simple: They want us out of Afghanistan. They want us out of their backyard,"" noted one U.S. defense source. ""The same way we would view the situation if Russia suddenly brought troops to Mexico. Afghanistan is mineral-rich and has an incredible amount of precious metals; it has always been Russia's policy to [dominate] that."" According to the New York Times, an individual by the name of Rahmatullah Azizi – a businessman who wants to take advantage of the U.S. contractor cash flow into the beleaguered nation – was the ""middle man"" figure behind alleged efforts to launder money from Russia into Afghanistan to pay off militants, and presumably fled to Russia before the funds were located in one of his properties. It also remains to be seen what – if any – impact accusations of Taliban taking Moscow money might have on their peace deal with the United States, which was signed in February following months of negotiations and paves the way for a withdrawal of U.S. troops after almost 19 years of stalemate war. ""This administration is set on a deal in order to get American troops out,"" Schmidt added. ""Because the cost in lives wasn't worth it.""",20,2.8306345852143853,3.1985162716545332,-0.36788168644014796,4

Intelligence community heads are set to brief top congressional leaders on Thursday about the reports that Russia has offered militants in Afghanistan bounties for killing American soldiers, the highest-level briefing for members of Congress on the matter so far. The 11:30 a.m. briefing will be given by Central Intelligence Agency Director Gina Haspel and National Security Agency Director Paul Nakasone, complying with Democrats' demands that lawmakers get their information on the scandal from those in the intelligence community rather than White House staff. After a briefing by White House officials of several top House Democrats on Tuesday, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., complained that “the right people to give the briefing” were “not in the room.” : ' '? Democrats have also demanded that all members of the House of Representatives be briefed on the bounty matter, which has escalated into a major story after reports that the president was informed about intelligence on the issue but did nothing in response. ""Over the weekend, we learned of allegations that our intelligence services assessed in March that Russia has been offering a monetary reward for killing American troops in Afghanistan. Outrageously, it appears that President Trump has taken no action since that time, not even warning the Russian government to stop,"" House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., said in a statement this week. But the administration has denied Trump was briefed on the reports, saying he wasn't told because the intelligence was disputed. It has not made any move to fulfill the full-House briefing request. ""Intel just reported to me that they did not find this info credible, and therefore did not report it to me or @. Possibly another fabricated Russia Hoax, maybe by the Fake News @nytimesbooks, wanting to make Republicans look bad!!!"" Trump tweeted on Sunday. ""The intelligence community doesn’t have a consensus,” National Security Adviser Robert O’Brien said of the president's knowledge of the bounties. “And as a result, the president’s career briefer decided not to brief him because it was unverified intelligence.” He added that he supported the decision by Trump's briefer Beth Sanner, who he called ""an outstanding officer,"" to not inform him of the ""unverified"" intelligence, which is sometimes provided to presidents with caveats based on the judgment of intelligence officials. Other reports, however, have indicated that the bounty information was included in the President's Daily Brief as long ago as last year, but Trump is known for not reading those detailed documents regularly. The Trump administration has briefed some members of both parties in the House and made classified documents available to both parties in the Senate. The House Intelligence Committee is scheduled to be briefed on the bounty issue Thursday at 1 p.m. and Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe attended a previously scheduled briefing with the Senate Intelligence Committee on Wednesday. 2036 The Gang of Eight is composed of leadership of both chambers of Congress, as well as the chairperson and ranking member of both chambers' intelligence committees.

There was confusion on Wednesday about when exactly the briefing would happen, with some believing it would be Wednesday and others saying Thursday. Later in the afternoon, however, White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany confirmed the briefing would take place Thursday. Members of Congress on both sides of the aisle have demanded answers on whether or not the president knew of the alleged bounties, citing the president's responsibility to protect American service members, with Democrats launching particularly sharp attacks.

""The Russia Bounty story is just another made up by Fake News tale that is told only to damage me and the Republican Party,"" Trump tweeted Wednesday.

McCaul, the top Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee pointed out that Russians working in coordination with the Taliban to kill American troops would be a ""significant"" divergence from working together to defeat . ' ' , '' ""These threats are coming in 2019 and then after a raid, reportedly after some Marines were killed and they had some detainees, this intelligence came out,"" McCaul told host Trace Gallagher. ""But another intelligence agency had a very strong dissenting view about the credibility of the intelligence itself. ""So, when you have a sort of diversion or a different point of view within the [intelligence community] itself, the briefer really has the discretion. In this case, a career intelligence officer had the discretion [of] whether it rises to the level of the president or not."" McCaul added that if there is a ""low degree of confidence,"" it may not be actionable. That may be a possible reason for not briefing President Trump. President Donald Trump, right, shakes hands with Russian President Vladimir Putin, left, during a bilateral meeting on the sidelines of the G-20 summit in Osaka, Japan last year.

Although the president and the White House have insisted Trump was never briefed on any intelligence about Russian bounties before The New York Times reported on the matter June 26, a separate source within the military told Fox News on Monday that special operations forces raided a Taliban outpost this year and recovered roughly $500,000. A subsequent interrogation of an Afghan fighter revealed that the money came from Russia. The source added, however, that the information could not be easily verified and the incident was not included in briefings to senior leaders at the Pentagon.

""And then, of course, they find a bag of cash with $500,000. That's very significant."" ""And, if they’re talking about this coming from Russia, Russia has been in Afghanistan since 1979,"" he explained. ""They've been up to no good – up to mischief. But, primarily, their connection with the Taliban has been more to defeat – not to kill America troops.""

' ' , '' ""If I led my Marines into an ambush because I didn't bother to read the intelligence report I was given that said we would get ambushed there, I wouldn't be tweeting that it wasn't my fault because I didn't read the report, I would be in prison,"" Moulton said. - In this Tuesday, Feb. 12, 2019 file photo, Rep. Seth Moulton, D-Mass., speaks at the Brookings Institution in Washington, about his vision for the future of U.S. foreign policy. The comments from Moulton, who had a shortlived 2020 presidential run, come as Democrats have ramped up the rhetoric against Trump over the Russian bounty reports and have demanded more answers from the White House about the intelligence assessment, first reported by the New York Times, that a Russia military unit paid bounties to Taliban-linked fighters to kill coalition troops in Afghanistan. The White House has pushed back hard on the reporting, saying Trump was not aware of the bounty program and intelligence officials didn't tell him because there was no consensus within the intel community on the alleged plot. Trump dismissed the reporting as a ""hoax."" ""The Russia Bounty story is just another made up by Fake News tale that is told only to damage me and the Republican Party,"" Trump tweeted. ‘ ' 3 The New York Times reported that the information about the bounty program was provided to Trump in his daily written brief in late February. The intelligence was taken seriously enough that it prompted an interagency meeting of the National Security Council in late March and U.S. officials shared the information with the British government, whose forces were also believed to have been targeted by the Russian bounties, the Times reported. It has been reported, however, that Trump does not read the detailed presidential brief regularly, and is more often briefed on intelligence issues verbally. Trump's National Security Adviser Robert O'Brien told ""Fox and Friends"" Wednesday that the officer who briefs the president decided not to tell the commander-in-chief that Russia was allegedly paying bounties to kill U.S. troops. ""The intelligence community does not have a consensus. And as a result, the president's career briefer decided not to brief him because it was unverified intelligence,"" O'Brien said. ""And, by the way, she is an outstanding officer and knowing all the facts I know, I certainly support her decision."" Trump's 2020 Democratic challenger Joe Biden argued the president failed in his duties whether he knew or didn't know of the bounty intelligence. “The idea that somehow he didn’t know is a dereliction of duty if that’s the case,” the former vice president said Tuesday in his first press conference in nearly three months. “And if he was briefed and he didn’t do anything about it that is a dereliction of duty."" Moulton's comments, however, went much further as he essentially accused Trump of being responsible for the deaths of U.S. service members in Afghanistan. The New York Times said investigators are reviewing at least two deadly attacks on American soldiers in Afghanistan for suspected links to the bounties. One is an April 2019 bombing outside Bagram Air Base that killed three Marines -- Staff Sgt. Christopher Slutman, 43; Cpl. Robert A. Hendriks, 25; and Sgt. Benjamin S. Hines, 31. The second attack was not identified. Moulton made a direct link to the Russian bounty intelligence and American troops dying, whereas other Democratic colleagues on the Wednesday call -- Rep. Jason Crow, D-Colo., and Rep. Andy Kim, D-N.J. -- did not make that connection. ""American kids are dead because Trump is more concerned about his political liability with Russia than the lives of American troops,"" Moulton claimed. ""He owes a phone call to the parents of each of those great Americans, like those Marines, half his age, who were killed by our enemy when he had this intelligence yet failed to act to save their lives."" ""And on that phone call, he better not act like a traitor to our flag who blames someone else for his dereliction,"" Moulton continued. ""Rather he should explain to those moms and dads that their sons would be alive today if he had taken an ounce of the responsibility expected of a second lieutenant as commander in chief.""

2020-07-01,Fox,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/russian-bounties-trumps-record-james-carafano,"James Carafano: On Russian bounties, Trump's record proves he would have acted if given solid intelligence","Republican Rep. Jim Banks and Democrat Rep. Brad Sherman weigh in on 'The Daily Briefing.' Do you think the president is reluctant to kill anyone — Russian or otherwise — who tries to kill Americans? If so, think again. Better yet, ask anyone in the Iranian regime. Iran just put out an arrest warrant for the president of the United States. His alleged crime: ordering an attack on Gen. Qasem Soleimani. That order came in January when the president received solid intelligence that Soleimani, commander of Iran’s Quds Force, had deliberately targeted American soldiers in Iraq. Soleimani was killed in a U.S. drone strike shortly thereafter. A ',"" There is a lesson there. If the White House had solid intelligence about the , the foreign military-intelligence agency of the Russian armed forces, offering bounties for killing American soldiers in Afghanistan , the president would take exactly the same step. He would find out who they are. He would never rest until they were punished. He would care no more about upsetting the Kremlin than he fretted about upsetting the mullahs in Tehran. As the commander-in-chief, the president’s job is to have the back of the men and women around the world who go into harm’s way on our behalf. He has consistently done that. The president also has a long track record of standing up to Moscow. True, Trump has kept the offer of a diplomatic channel open to Putin. So what? Most world leaders have also sought a working relationship with Russia. Just days ago, French President Emmanuel Macron called for more dialogue with Moscow. Trump, however, has always dealt with Putin from a position of strength. He has gotten our allies to beef up their investments in . He has helped arm Ukraine in their battle against Russian proxies. He has pulled out of the one-sided Intermediate Range Nuclear Forces and the Open Skies treaties. He has opposed the NordStream pipeline, which would give Russia more leverage over Europe. And all the while he has supported sanctions on Russia. The record is clear. Trump has taken plenty of steps to beef up U.S. military muscle and push back against Russian aggression. The last thing he would do is give Moscow a pass for taking contracts out on American soldiers. So what should we expect the president to do about these reports of Russian bounties on U.S. soldiers? We should expect the same judicious and deliberate approach he demonstrated in dealing with Iran. The president went after Soleimani only after the U.S. fully verified claims that the Iranian had targeted Americans for attack. Once U.S. intelligence had Soleimani dead to rights, Trump gave the approval to strike. Even then, the president came in for withering criticism. Murder-for-hire is exactly the kind of despicable, covert tactic we can expect from the . It’s how the Soviets operated during Cold War, and Putin is notorious for his penchant for reaching back to the old bag of tricks to wreak mayhem on the modern world. And there is no doubt the Russians would love to see the Afghan peace process collapse. Putin would like nothing better than to see American peace-making fail. In dealing with Putin, however, no administration can afford to make foreign policy at the behest of haphazard reporting by the New York Times. Just having “intelligence” reports is not enough to guide international relations and life-and-death decision making. Before they can be considered actionable, intelligence reports must go through a rigorous intelligence assessment that weighs sources and methods. The intelligence community must make sure it knows not just what is being done, but who is really behind the action. Since the Times story came out, administration officials—including the secretary of defense, director of national intelligence and the national security adviser—have confirmed that the president was not briefed and that the intelligence wasn’t ready for prime time. They do, however, now have something more to worry about: the intelligence leak that sparked the story. They fear it might actually put soldiers’ lives at risk by compromising on-going intelligence efforts to get to ground truth. What if the intelligence community does verify that the Russians are offering bounties for dead Americans? Once that assessment is made, the president can be properly briefed and given suitable, credible options for responding. Then, and only then, the president should he take decisive action, just as he did with Soleimani.",20,1.861144968901658,2.167440790855084,-0.3062958219534262,4

Jim Banks: Russian bounties to Taliban story may be putting US lives at risk — here's how,"Scrambling to revive the Russian collusion narrative before the 2020 election, the New York Times may have imperiled our troops’ lives and compromised American national security by reporting on unconfirmed intel. This story is a big deal to me — it’s personal. I am angry that friends I served with in Afghanistan could’ve had a target on their backs. I did more than 50 vehicle convoy missions outside the wire when I served in 2014-15: There may have been a bounty on my head. So, how do we know Russians were paying Taliban fighters bounties for killing American troops? We don’t. O': – , The Taliban said they weren’t getting paid by Russians. The Russian government says they weren’t doling out bounties. It may not have even been the Russians — Iran has often targeted our troops in that region. We don’t know who’s telling the truth, and now we maybe never will. If Russia was putting bounties on American troops’ heads, they are shredding every piece of evidence that it happened as we speak. All because President Trump’s breathless critics in the media decided to insert themselves and interrupt the intelligence community’s efforts. I serve on the House Armed Services Committee, so I track the Russian threat very closely. We also follow the China threat and the Iran threat closely, as well as a dozen other areas of interest to American national security. I desperately want to know about our adversary’s malign activity in Afghanistan and every inch of the globe. If our troops are in harm’s way, members of the House Armed Services Committee need to know that. We rely on the intelligence community to do their jobs and vet intelligence for us. There are a lot of rumors floating around globally. If we acted on all of them, it’d be unwise. That’s why we are patient and require hard, confirmed intelligence vetted by the intelligence community before we act. As an American and a veteran of the war in Afghanistan, I’m disgusted that Trump’s detractors would put American lives in harm’s way just to try and score political points ahead of the 2020 election. Now the intelligence community’s hands are tied. They can’t follow up on this intelligence and learn more about the Russian operation in Afghanistan, which leaves our troops stationed there in danger. Worse, everyone from National Security Adviser Robert O’Brien to Central Intelligence Agency Gina Haspel is now having to turn their entire attention into explaining the nuances of our national security processes to the media. And for what? The real irony — no one believes in this hoax anymore. The Russian-collusion narrative has been dispelled time and again. The House and Senate Intelligence committees said there was no evidence of collusion. The intelligence community said there was no collusion. Bob Mueller said there was no collusion. Politically speaking, I’m glad the Democrats have chosen to reinvent the Russian collusion conspiracy theory. Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., and Rep. Ted Lieu, D-Calif., look silly trying to spin up outrage at this story. No one is buying that President Trump, who’s spent his first four years rebuilding a military Barack Obama laid to waste, giving our veterans the care they deserve and championing an “America First” foreign policy, would sacrifice our troops to get cozier with Vladimir Putin. In fact, no one’s been tougher on the Russians than Trump! If we had verified this intelligence, we can count on the president to hold Russia accountable just as he’s done since his presidency began. But as an American and a veteran of the war in Afghanistan, I’m disgusted that Trump’s detractors would put American lives in harm’s way just to try and score political points ahead of the 2020 election. No doubt, Russia is smugly sitting back and watching Democrats do their work for them. Russia wins when we are divided. In 2016, they used Facebook ads to generate outrage and pit Americans against one another. In 2020, thanks to the New York Times, Russia is being given another platform to interfere in this election. This is the real scandal, and anyone serious about stopping Russia’s malign activities in the United States will help us stop it. .",20,1.5511321685231223,1.7829471789644185,-0.23181501044129615,11

Kirsten Gillibrand, Democratic member of the Senate Armed Services Committee. The Defense Department said late Monday that there is “no corroborating evidence” to support the explosive New York Times report last week that said the Russian military offered bounties to Taliban-linked militants to kill U.S. troops in Afghanistan. The report sent shock waves through Washington and prompted President Trump to outright deny knowing anything about the intel cited in the report. “To date, has no corroborating evidence to validate the recent allegations found in open-source reports. Regardless, we always take the safety and security of our forces in Afghanistan—and around the world—most seriously and therefore continuously adopt measures to prevent harm from potential threats,” Jonathan Hoffman, the chief Pentagon spokesman, said in a statement. The New York Times, citing unnamed officials, reported Friday that it is believed that some “Islamist militants” or “criminal elements” collected payouts. The report pointed out that 20 Americans were killed there in 2019. It was not clear if any of those deaths were the result of a bounty. Despite the Pentagon statement, the picture remains murky. Fox News reported earlier Monday that multiple intelligence threat streams indicated Russian intelligence operatives did offer bounties to Taliban-linked militants to kill U.S. troops -- but while the National Security Council met recently to come up with a number of responses, it did not brief President Trump. A senior U.S. official who has been briefed on the matter said that the information the received was based on “several streams of intelligence of concern” with some of it being contradictory and some open to interpretation. A military source said there was a raid in Afghanistan early this year that found a large amount of cash, and a fighter said in a subsequent interrogation the money came from Russia -- but it was not easily verified. Further, it was not a piece of intelligence that made its way into briefings for senior leaders at the Pentagon. U.S. officials are now concerned that, because of the leaked story, Russia will try to cover its tracks on this so-called bounty scheme. Further, the Russians and other actors including the Iranians have been interfering in Afghanistan for some time in an effort to harm U.S. interests, Fox News is told. Robert O’Brien, the national security adviser, said in a statement that since the allegations in the report were not verified by the intelligence community, Trump has not been briefed on the matter. “Nevertheless, the administration, including the National Security Council staff, have been preparing should the situation warrant action,” he said. He said that Trump’s top priority is the security of Americans and the safety of the men and women who serve in the military. Rep. Michael McCaul, the ranking member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, and Rep. Adam Kinzinger were in the briefing led by Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe, White House chief of staff Mark Meadows and national security adviser Robert O'Brien. McCaul and Kinzinger said in a statement that lawmakers were told ""there is an ongoing review to determine the accuracy of these reports."" ""If the intelligence review process verifies the reports, we strongly encourage the Administration to take swift and serious action to hold the Putin regime accountable,"" they said. The White House has maintained that neither Trump nor Vice President Mike Pence was briefed on such intelligence. “This does not speak to the merit of the alleged intelligence but to the inaccuracy of the New York Times story erroneously suggesting that President Trump was briefed on this matter,” press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said in a statement. A White House official told Fox News on Monday that Trump has now been briefed on the issue. It’s unclear exactly when this briefing took place, but the official says it took place sometime “after the Times reported on unverified intelligence.” The statement is at odds with the White House, which insisted that Trump has still not been briefed. Thomas Joscelyn, a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a think tank, told the Wall Street Journal that “Moscow’s willingness to embrace the Taliban openly and publicaly dates back several years” and he would not be surprised if there is truth to the report.

Eliot Engel, D-N.Y., among others. Hoyer and Schiff each said that they wanted actual members of the intelligence community to brief them rather than White House staff. ""Sunday evening I received a telephone call from"" White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows, who ""asked me to put together a group of eight to ten members of the purpose of having a briefing,"" Engel said at a press conference after the briefing. He continued to say that the briefing still did not fulfill the ""speaker and the minority leader of the Senate's request for a full briefing of our members."" ""The right people to give the briefing were ... not in the room,"" Schiff said. ""Many of us do not understand his affinity for that autocratic ruler who means our nation ill,"" he added, speaking of Trump's alleged past deference to Russian President Vladimir Putin. Schiff said that is ""a problem for our entire nation's security."" In response to questions, Hoyer said ""we did not receive any new substantive information"" and that he did not get assurances from the White House that there would be a full briefing for all members. Hoyer on Monday had demanded a briefing for all House members on the matter. ""President Truman used to have a plaque on his desk that said ‘The buck stops here.’ President Trump’s approach seems to be, dangerously, as he has said before, ‘I don’t take responsibility at all,'"" Hoyer said in a statement. ""Over the weekend, we learned of allegations that our intelligence services assessed in March that Russia has been offering a monetary reward for killing American troops in Afghanistan. Outrageously, it appears that President Trump has taken no action since that time, not even warning the Russian government to stop."" In this image from video, Rep. Steny Hoyer, D-Md., takes his face covering off as he speaks on the floor of the House of Representatives at the U.S. Capitol in Washington, Thursday, April 23, 2020. ' ' The majority leader added: ""While I will be going to the White House tomorrow for a briefing with several House Democrats, the President and his team ought to brief the full House on this serious situation immediately."" Eight House Republicans were briefed at the White House on Monday, including Conference Chairwoman Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., who over the weekend demanded answers on the bounty scandal. She released a joint statement with Rep. Mac Thornberry, R-Texas, the ranking member of the House Armed Services Committee. ""After today’s briefing with senior White House officials, we remain concerned about Russian activity in Afghanistan, including reports that they have targeted U.S. forces. It has been clear for some time that Russia does not wish us well in Afghanistan. We believe it is important to vigorously pursue any information related to Russia or any other country targeting our forces,"" the high-ranking Republicans said. ""We anticipate further briefings on the issue in the coming days."" The White House has denied that Trump was briefed on the issue despite reporting to the contrary from outlets like the New York Times, which reported late Monday that the bounty issue was in the written President's Daily Brief earlier this year. It has been widely reported, however, that Trump does not read the detailed brief regularly, and is more often briefed on intelligence issues verbally. iNG , : The Associated Press further reported that top White House officials were aware in early 2019 of intelligence suggesting Russia was offering the bounties to the Taliban. This, officials told the , was in at least one of Trump's written briefings at the time. But a senior administration official on Monday told Fox News that the president was not briefed due to a lack of clarity about the bounty allegations. "" was never briefed on this issue because there is no consensus within the intelligence community on these allegations,"" the official said. A National Security Council spokesman further said that ""[t]he veracity of the underlying allegations continues to be evaluated."" And National Security Adviser Robert O'Brien said in a statement that ""[b]ecause the allegations in recent press articles have not been verified or substantiated by the Intelligence Community, President Trump had not been briefed on the items. Nevertheless, the Administration including the National Security Council staff, have been preparing should the situation warrant action."" A senior U.S. official who has been briefed on the matter told Fox News that ""several intelligence streams of concern,"" some contradictory, have led the to discuss options regarding Russian actions in Afghanistan."" And the Department of Defense, through Chief Pentagon Spokesman Jonathan Hoffman, said that ""[t]o date, has no corroborating evidence to validate the recent allegations found in open-source reports."" 'T It's not clear whether the denials that the president had been briefed mean the intelligence never appeared in the President's Daily Brief or that the issue was never brought up to the president personally, and seemingly conflicting information going public has muddied the issue of just how sure the government is that Russia has put bounties on American troops in Afghanistan. The White House has also denied that the issue was ever flagged to Vice President Pence. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., was not one of the Democrats attending the Tuesday morning briefing at the White House, but on Monday said that she spoke with Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe and Central Intelligence Agency Director Gina Haspel about the bounty allegations. Pelosi did not say in a statement what they told her, but said that she called on the intelligence community leaders ""to follow up on my formal request for a full House briefing on the intelligence surrounding Russian bounties."" Pelosi added: ""Many serious questions remain regarding what the White House is doing to address threats to American and allied troops and to hold Russia accountable."" The other House Democrats involved in the Tuesday briefing are House Armed Services Committee Chairman Rep. Adam Smith, D-Wash., and Reps. Gregory Meeks, D-N.Y., Brad Sherman, D-Calif., Bill Keating, D-Mass., Ruben Gallego, D-Ariz., Abigail Spanberger, D-Va., and Elissa Slotkin, D-Mich. Smith on Monday also released a statement questioning why Trump wouldn't have known if the intelligence community had indications Russia was placing bounties on the heads of American soldiers. ""Yet, President Trump claims he had no prior knowledge of the bounties that Russia placed on American soldiers. That excuse only gives rise to more questions,"" he said. ""Why didn’t the President receive a briefing on such a highly sensitive subject? Was this information included in the Presidential Daily briefing? If not, why not? Was this information shared with our military leaders?""

Banks says NYT revealed sensitive details on Russia bounty intel,"Russia reportedly offered cash to Taliban militants to kill U.S. troops in Afghanistan; reaction and analysis from the 'Special Report' All-Stars. A top Republican lawmaker said Monday that The New York Times has ""blood"" on its hands, after the paper reported that Russia secretly offered bounties to Taliban-linked militants for killing American troops in Afghanistan. Rep. Jim Banks, R-Ind., who attended a meeting with top White House and intelligence officials earlier in the day, charged in a series of tweets that the Times had ""used unconfirmed intel in an investigation into targeted killing of American soldiers in order to smear the President."" The Times' ""hit piece,"" Banks said, had incorrectly suggested that Trump was personally briefed on the intelligence, contrary to claims from senior White House and intelligence officials. ""Sad, but many in the media & Congress rushed to judgement before learning the whole story,"" Banks wrote. ""We should treat anonymously sourced @nytimes stories about Russia w/ skepticism."" Several previous stories in the Times concerning Russia have been disputed; perhaps most famously, in 2017, former Director James Comey slammed a Times story about alleged Trump team contacts with Russians as ""not true."" The intelligence community has been investigating an April 2019 attack on an American convoy that killed three U.S. Marines after a car rigged with explosives detonated near their armored vehicles as they traveled back to Bagram Airfield, the largest U.S. military installation in Afghanistan, officials told the Associated Press. Three other U.S. service members were wounded in the attack, along with an Afghan contractor. The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack on Twitter. The officials the spoke to also said they were looking closely at insider attacks — sometimes called “green-on-blue” incidents — from 2019 to determine if they are also linked to Russian bounties. One official said the administration discussed several potential responses, but the White House has yet to authorize any step. ""Having served in Afghanistan during the time the alleged bounties were placed, no one is angrier about this than me,"" Banks wrote. ""Now it’s impossible to finish the investigation. All b/c the @nytimes will do anything to damage @realdonaldtrump , even if it means compromising nat'l security."" The White House said Monday that Trump wasn't briefed on U.S. intelligence assessments concerning the bounties because the information had not been verified. Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany told reporters Monday that Trump — even now — had not been briefed on the allegations because the intelligence “would not be elevated to the president until it was verified."" : '' The result was an odd situation in which eight Republican lawmakers attended a briefing at the White House on Monday about explosive allegations that the president himself was said to have not been fully read in on. A White House official said Democrats also were invited to a White House briefing. It was scheduled to take place Tuesday morning, according to two Democratic aides. - In this file photo taken on Wednesday, June 24, 2020, Russian President Vladimir Putin, center, watches the Victory Day military parade marking the 75th anniversary of the Nazi defeat in Moscow. Russian authorities seem to be pulling out all the stops to get people to vote on a series of constitutional amendments that would enable President Vladimir Putin to stay in office until 2036 by resetting the clock on his term limits. Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., the vice chair of the Senate intelligence committee, told Fox News that the administration was simply trying to appease Russia. His rhetoric echoed similar statements by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif, who has repeatedly alleged that ""all roads lead to Putin."" “I'm not going to talk about any specific intelligence,"" Warner said. ""But this constant effort in this administration to kowtow to Putin is not in America's best interest."" Even some left-of-center commentators, meanwhile, were skeptical, given the numerous false or misleading reports over the past three years pushing unsubstantiated claims of a conspiracy between the Trump team and Russia. ""We are now in year of unhinged Trump-Russia conspiracy theories, chauvinism, and innuendo,"" wrote Aaron Mate. ""If you're a journalist and not willing to apply aggressive skepticism to its latest iteration, you shouldn't be on this beat."" McEnany, for her part, repeatedly stressed that the allegations had not been confirmed. “There is no consensus within the intelligence community on these allegations and in effect there are dissenting opinions from some in the intelligence community with regards to the veracity of what’s being reported and the veracity of the underlying allegations continue to be evaluated,"" she said. The intelligence assessments came amid Trump’s push to withdraw the U.S. from Afghanistan. They suggested Russia was making overtures to militants as the U.S. and the Taliban held talks to end the long-running war. Republican Sen. John Cornyn told reporters Monday, “I don’t think it’s should be a surprise to anybody that the Taliban’s been trying to kill Americans and that the Russians have been encouraging that, if not providing means to make that happen.” U.S. troops patrol at an Afghan National Army Base in Logar province, Afghanistan August 7, 2018. /Omar Sobhani - 1D8EB3A110 While Russian meddling in Afghanistan isn’t new, officials said Russian operatives became more aggressive in their desire to contract with the Taliban and members of the Haqqani Network, a militant group aligned with the Taliban in Afghanistan and designated a foreign terrorist organization in 2012. Rep. Michael McCaul, the ranking member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, and Rep. Adam Kinzinger, who were in the briefing Monday led by Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe, White House chief of staff Mark Meadows and National Security Adviser Robert O'Brien, said in a statement that lawmakers were told “there is an ongoing review to determine the accuracy of these reports.” “If the intelligence review process verifies the reports, we strongly encourage the Administration to take swift and serious action to hold the Putin regime accountable,” they said. 'T ' ' The intelligence officials told the that Trump was briefed on the bounty matter earlier this year; Trump denied that, tweeting Sunday that neither he nor Vice President Mike Pence had been briefed. Trump tweeted Sunday night he was just told intelligence officials didn’t report the information to him because they didn’t find it credible. The intelligence officials and others with knowledge of the matter insisted on anonymity to discuss the highly sensitive matter. The White House National Security Council wouldn't confirm the assessments but said the U.S. receives thousands of intelligence reports daily that are subject to strict scrutiny. Trump’s Democratic general election rival, former Vice President Joe Biden, used an online fundraiser Monday to hammer the president for a “betrayal” of American troops in favor of “an embarrassing campaign of deferring and debasing himself before Putin.” “I’m disgusted,” Biden told donors, as he recalled his late son Beau’s military service. Families of service members, Biden said, “should never, ever have to worry they’ll face a threat like this: the commander-in-chief turning a blind eye.” Asked about the reports on the alleged bounties, Russian President Vladimir Putin’s spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Monday, “These claims are lies.” “If in the U.S. the special services are continuing to report to the president, I suggest that one be guided by the relevant statement of President Trump, who has already given his assessment of these publications,” he told reporters during a conference call. John Bolton, an ex-national security adviser who was forced out by Trump last September and has written a tell-all book about his White House tenure, said Sunday it's ""pretty remarkable the president’s going out of his way to say he hasn’t heard anything about it. One asks, why would he do something like that?” Fox News' Jason Donner and Chad Pergram, as well as The Associated Press, contributed to this report.",20,1.1866854451395061,1.222197330558911,-0.035511885419404976,11

White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany faced a barrage of questions Monday about why the White House was not briefed by intelligence on a report claiming Russia paid Taliban-linked militants to kill U.S. troops in Afghanistan. During a press briefing, McEnany repeatedly asserted there was “no consensus” on the validity of such reports and said the president was only briefed on verified intelligence. The press secretary added that the intelligence community is fraught with “dissenting opinions” in regards to the Russian bounties. The claim ""would not be elevated to the president until it was verified,"" McEnany added. The press secretary added that the New York Times, which broke the story, “erroneously reported” that the president had been briefed on the intelligence when neither he nor Vice President Pence had been briefed. , McEnany noted “there’s no stronger advocate” for members of the military than President Trump and said he has been “extremely strong” on Russia, “imposing sanctions on hundreds of Russian individuals, expelling dozens of diplomats, closing two Russian consulates, withdrawing from an treaty and several other actions.” The press secretary said the White House had invited eight members of Congress from both parties to be briefed on the situation Monday afternoon. McEnany’s assertion echoed that of another senior administration official who spoke with Fox News, who said there was “no consensus” on the intelligence report claiming Russia offered bounties to Taliban-linked militants who attacked the U.S. military. On Sunday night, Trump on Twitter insisted he had not been informed of the reports because the intelligence community ""did not find this info credible.” ""The veracity of the underlying allegations continues to be evaluated,"" a National Security Council spokesman told Fox News.

A separate source within the military told Fox News on Monday that special operations forces this year raided a Taliban outpost and recovered roughly $500,000, with a subsequent interrogation of an Afghan fighter revealing that the money came from Russia. The source added, however, that the information was unable to be easily verified and the incident was not included in briefings to senior leaders at the Pentagon. U.S. officials are now concerned because of the leaked story that Russia will try to cover its tracks on this so-called bounty scheme. Sen.

Check out what's clicking on FoxNews.com. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said on Sunday that she’s unclear as to what “the Russians have on” President Trump, but added that it must have swayed his administration not to take action after U.S. intelligence learned that Moscow spies offered bounties to Afghan militants to kill U.S. troops. Pelosi said during an interview on ’s “This Week” that throughout Trump’s presidency he has ignored allegations against misdeeds committed by Russia, but that the new reports on bounties “is as bad as it gets.” “This is as bad as it gets, and yet the president will not confront the Russians on this score, denies being briefed,” Pelosi said. “I don't know what the Russians have on the president, politically, personally, financially, or whatever it is, but he wants to ignore, he wants to bring them back to the G-8 despite the annexation of Crimea and invasion of Ukraine.” , The New York Times first reported over the weekend that American intelligence officials have determined a Russian military unit secretly offered bounties to Taliban-linked militants for killing coalition forces, including targeting American troops. The Wall Street Journal and Washington Post also reported on the Kremlin's effort to orchestrate attacks on Western troops. The Times reported that President Trump and the White House's National Security Council were briefed on Russia's bounty rewards in late March. They discussed an appropriate response, ranging from making a diplomatic complaint to Moscow and economic sanctions, but the White House had not yet authorized a response. The White House said Saturday that Trump was not briefed on the alleged Russian bounty intelligence, but didn't confirm or deny the underlying reporting that Russia was giving out rewards to attack U.S. soldiers. Trump on Sunday added his own denial of being briefed, saying in a tweet that neither he nor Pence or White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows had been notified of the bounties, and questioned the veracity and sourcing of the New York Times’ article. , Pelosi did not question that Trump was not briefed on the matter, but wondered why U.S. intelligence officials had decided not to tell the president. “What does that say about the concern that those who briefed the president have about not going anywhere near the Russia issue with this president?” she said. When asked about what evidence she has that Russia has compromising information on Trump, Pelosi said that the president’s past denials of wrongdoing on the part of Moscow are all the evidence she needs. “How … else would you explain his refusal to even – to ignore again and again the intelligence that puts right at the Russian doorstep?”",20,0.510086618658356,2.797641755583754,-2.287555136925398,11

It was not clear if any of those deaths were the result of a bounty. “Intel just reported to me that they did not find this info credible, and therefore did not report it to me or @.

The White House said neither Trump nor Vice President Mike Pence was briefed on such intelligence. “This does not speak to the merit of the alleged intelligence but to the inaccuracy of the New York Times story erroneously suggesting that President Trump was briefed on this matter,” press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said in a statement. The Times’ report sent a shockwave through the Capitol on Friday where politicians have been focused on the recent unrest after George Floyd’s death in police custody and what many are referring to a resurgent coronavirus outbreak. The paper said that Trump was briefed on the intelligence and the administration’s National Security Council considered issuing a diplomatic complaint to Moscow. The report said that Russia is conducting what is referred to as a hybrid war with the U.S.—which consists of cyberattacks and military operations that can be denied.

""This does not speak to the merit of the alleged intelligence but to the inaccuracy of the New York Times story erroneously suggesting that President Trump was briefed on this matter.” The reporting quickly became fodder for the 2020 presidential campaign. During a town hall Saturday, former Vice President Joe Biden brought up the “shocking revelation” that Trump reportedly knew of the bounties for months and slammed the president for doing “worse than nothing.” “Not only has he failed to sanction or impose any kind of consequences on Russia for this egregious violation of international law, Donald Trump has continued his embarrassing campaign of deference and debasing himself before Vladimir Putin,” Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, said. “He has had this information according to the Times, and yet he offered to host Putin in the United States and sought to invite Russia to rejoin the G7. His entire presidency has been a gift to Putin.” Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., questioned how Trump could hold an amicable relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin -- even welcoming him to a G-7 Summit in America -- while his regime was reportedly trying to kill Americans.

Get all the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox. Sign up here. Chinese Communist Party tactics have shifted to imitate classic Russian disinformation campaigns, as well as amplify bogus stories from Moscow to pin the blame for coronavirus on the U.S., according to a State Department official and analysts. U.S. officials said they’re now seeing Russian disinformation migrate from social media to state media and even official press conferences. “Beijing is pursuing a comprehensive and coordinated influence campaign to advance its interest and undermine the United States,” said U.S. Special Envoy Lea Gabrielle, Global Engagement Center. “The is employing a whole-of-government approach, using political, economic, military, and information tools to advance its influence” American officials cite Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Geng Shuang this week openly questioning safety at U.S.-funded biological laboratories in the former Soviet Union and requested the U.S. “heed the concerns from the international community.” The narrative quickly spread throughout state-run media and is included in articles like ’s “10 conflicting things in U.S. government's handling of the pandemic” warning the U.S.-funded labs raise “serious questions as to what research is being conducted by these labs and why the U.S. keeps tight-lipped about it.” U.S. officials also pointed to a Chinese government spokesperson demanding earlier this week that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo clarify when -19 originated in the U.S., suggesting the American government is hiding that information. “China has traditionally operated in the information space as an actor that tries to prop itself up,” said Kristine Lee, an associate fellow with the Asia-Pacific Security Program at the Center for a New American Security. “The negative messaging is a new dimension to its information operations that we're seeing unfold today, and that may become more prominent in its influence campaigns in the future as well.” Like officials in Moscow, China’s government is increasingly leveraging automated bots and trolls on social media. They’re also employing Chinese-designed social media apps, state-owned media, government spokespeople and even American platforms like Twitter to create a “mutually reinforcing feedback loop,” according to Lee. : While the approach of government officials in Beijing and Moscow merge, U.S. officials said their aims are different. ""While the Kremlin seeks to chaotically disrupt the current world order to accomplish its goals, the seeks to deliberately shape it to Beijing's advantage,” said Gabrielle. To counter these narratives, State Department officials said they’ve launched public messaging campaigns across the world, engaged diplomats and funded projects with local organizations in Africa, South America, and Europe. Officials said the disinformation campaign continues from Beijing to promote the Chinese government as the global leader in the -19 response and the West as failing to protect its citizens and help other countries. “Whether there is actual public buy-in, I would be skeptical that countries and their populations don't see this sort of the patently manufactured nature of these narratives,” said Lee of the Chinese government campaign. “Once the dust settles and we are in a world in which we're grappling with the after-effects of the pandemic, there may be a backlash against China's actions, particularly in the information space.”",20,4.541836817426603,3.375736892356549,1.1660999250700539,17
2020-04-22,Fox,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/house-senate-russian-meddoing-dueling-reports-fred-fleitz,Fred Fleitz: Here's what's behind the Senate-House disputes on Russian meddling in 2016 election,"Rep. Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., discusses the latest update from Attorney General William Barr on John Durham's investigation into abuse leading up to the 2016 election. While the nation is focused on the coronavirus pandemic, the Senate Intelligence Committee issued a bipartisan report Tuesday that challenges House conclusions about former Director John Brennan cooking intelligence for political purposes. At issue is a controversial January 2017 intelligence community assessment that concluded that Russia had meddled in the 2016 presidential election to help Donald Trump win. That assessment supported the basic premise of the widely discredited Steele Dossier that, according to recently declassified documents, contained Russian disinformation. In March 2018, the House Intelligence Committee issued a report saying the intelligence community assessment had been politicized to hurt Trump. I am a former analyst and House Intelligence Committee staff member who expressed such views in Fox News op-eds in January and May 2017. ' ' The report released Tuesday was the second Senate Intelligence Committee report contradicting the findings of the House and other intelligence experts. The first Senate report was issued in July 2018. Naturally, the political establishment and anti-Trump journalists gloated about the new Senate Intelligence Committee report as bolstering their biases. reporter Ken Dilanian breathlessly tweeted that it “confirmed the accuracy of the 2017 intelligence assessment on Russian election interference, undercutting far right conspiracy theories.” According to the latest Senate Intelligence Committee report, proper procedures were dutifully followed in drafting the intelligence community assessment. The Committee did not discover any significant analytic tradecraft issues in the preparation or final presentation of the ,” the Intelligence Committee report says, adding that “The reflects proper analytic tradecraft despite being tasked and completed within a compressed timeframe.” However, the House Intelligence Committee came to a different conclusion in its March 2018 report, finding that the intelligence community assessment’s judgments on why Russian President Vladimir Putin meddled in the 2016 U.S. presidential election did not employ proper analytic tradecraft. So who is right? Accusing the intelligence community of improper “analytic tradecraft” in analyzing Russia’s strategic intentions is an extremely grave indictment for a congressional oversight committee to make. In my opinion, there is no question the House Intelligence Committee is right for the reasons in its 2018 report and other subsequent findings. The House committee found the intelligence community assessment violated protocols for drafting such assessments. This major finding shows why America needs strong legislative oversight over the intelligence services. For example, although the protocols require intelligence community assessments to be “community products” and vetted with all intelligence agencies and analysts with equities in a given subject, only three intelligence agencies were asked to draft this assessment: the , National Security Agency and . With the 14 other intelligence agencies left out, the three participating agencies included only two dozen “handpicked” analysts. Other intelligence agencies working on this issue, such as the Defense Intelligence Agency and the Department of Homeland Security, were excluded. In addition, House Intelligence Committee staff revealed the actual drafting of the intelligence community assessment was done by three close associates of former Director Brennan, who has proven to be the most politicized intelligence chief in American history. Contrary to common practice for controversial intelligence community assessments, Brennan’s team allowed no dissenting views or even an annex with reviews by outside experts. These were extraordinary violations of intelligence community rules to ensure that analysis is accurate and trusted. The Senate committee reports ignored these foundational violations. The Senate Intelligence Committee report falsely claims that “all analytical lines are supported with all-source intelligence” and that analysts who wrote the intelligence community assessment consistently said they “were under no politically motivated pressure to reach specific conclusions.” House Intelligence Committee staff members found the opposite. They told me there was conflicting intelligence evidence on Russian motivations for meddling in the 2016 election. More gravely, they said that Director Brennan suppressed facts or analysis that showed why it was not in Russia’s interests to support Trump and why Putin stood to benefit from Hillary Clinton’s election. They also told me that Brennan suppressed that intelligence over the objections of analysts. House Intelligence Committee staff told me that after an exhaustive investigation reviewing intelligence and interviewing intelligence officers, they found that Brennan suppressed high-quality intelligence suggesting that Putin actually wanted the more predictable and malleable Clinton to win the 2016 election. Instead, the Brennan team included low-quality intelligence that failed to meet intelligence community standards to support the political claim that Russian officials wanted Trump to win, House Intelligence Committee staff revealed. They said that analysts also objected to including that flawed, substandard information in the assessment. So why did the Senate and House Intelligence Committees come to such starkly different conclusions? Why would professional intelligence officers give different accounts to these committees? Democrats and their left-wing media allies claim the House Intelligence Committee’s findings are not credible because they were solely the work of what was then the Republican majority under then-Chairman Devin Nunes, R-Calif. On the other hand, the Democrats and their media allies contend that the Senate Intelligence Committee’s findings must be believed because they are bipartisan and endorsed by the committee’s Republican Chairman Sen. Richard Burr of North Carolina. I strongly disagree for several reasons. First, I’ve carefully reviewed the unclassified House Intelligence Committee reports and spoken to committee members and professional staff about their Russia investigations. I found their work credible, aggressively researched, and soundly analyzed. The unprecedented partisanship of the present chairman, Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., and his staff’s apparently authorized leaks, made a bipartisan report impossible. It is unfair to reject the House Intelligence Committee report out of hand just because it was written by Republican members. Second, it is more reasonable to regard any bipartisan report on this subject as suspicious. Democratic lawmakers have been fanatically united in promoting the false Trump-Russia collusion narrative. So it is impossible to believe that a Democratic Senate Intelligence Committee member would allow any references in the panel’s reports that intelligence was slanted and weaponized to undermine Trump’s presidency. If information ever reached the Senate Intelligence Committee about Brennan suppressing intelligence in the intelligence community assessment that Putin favored Clinton instead of Trump, its Democratic members and staff certainly would have demanded that those crucial facts never be known. Third, it is well known that Sen. Burr has been an extraordinarily weak Senate Intelligence Committee chairman. Some on Capitol Hill quip that the oversees Burr, not the other way around. Burr basically has allowed Committee Vice Chairman Mark Warner, D-Va., to run the committee. Burr refused to cooperate with President Trump’s attempts to name a new director of national intelligence last summer because of Warner’s objections. Finally, intelligence officers likely told different stories to Republican House Intelligence Committee and bipartisan Senate Intelligence Committee investigators because of the strong political bias within intelligence agencies against President Trump. The intelligence officers probably felt free to level with Republican staff members about how the intelligence community assessment was weaponized. But they would not level with the bipartisan Senate investigation because they worried that their honest assessments that countered the narrative would get back to their supervisors and damage their careers. I witnessed this problem several times during more than two decades in government. So what happens next? Acting Director of National Intelligence Rick Grenell is trying to get to the bottom of problems with the 2017 Russia intelligence community assessment. He has asked to see all of the intelligence on which it is based. More importantly, federal prosecutor John Durham reportedly is looking into the drafting of the intelligence community assessment as part of his investigation of possible government wrongdoing before and after the last presidential election. One anticipates that a tough lawman like Durham, with confidence from both sides of the political aisle, will finally answer whether the 2017 intelligence community assessment was rigged to hurt Trump politically.",20,3.5142434191277494,3.7486865265235,-0.2344431073957507,11

Speaking on behalf of his colleagues, Estonia’s Ambassador Sven Jurgenson said it was clear who carried out the cyber attack. “We are clear that Russia's military intelligence service, the G.R.U, conducted the cyber attacks in attempt to sow discord and disrupt the lives of ordinary Georgian people. These cyber attacks are part of Russia's long-running campaign of hostile and destabilizing activity against Georgia and are part of a wider pattern of malign activity.” 'S , 'S - Jurgenson continued: “These actions clearly contradict Russia's attempts to claim it is a responsible actor in cyberspace and demonstrate a continuing pattern of reckless G.R.U cyber operations against a number of countries. Irresponsibility in cyberspace is detrimental to all of us.” Although the attack occurred in October, Georgian authorities blamed Russia’s last month. The Associated Press reported the large-scale cyber-attack was aimed at the Tbilisi government and private organizations with the goal of destabilizing the country. The attack centered on disrupting two of Georgia’s major networks and it also disrupted some two thousand websites both government and privately owned sites. , 'S ' ,' Georgian authorities told the that the cyber attack “was designed to hinder Georgia’s efforts to join the European Union and .” Secretary of State Michael Pompeo in a statement last month blamed the Russian General Staff Main Intelligence Directorate for carrying out what he called, “a widespread disruptive cyber attack against the country of Georgia.” Pompeo’s statement described the attack as contradicting Russian attempts to “claim it is a responsible actor in cyberspace and demonstrates a continuing pattern of reckless Russian cyber operations in a number of countries...these operations aim to sow division, create insecurity, and undermine democratic institutions."" Pompeo's statement concluded by offering help to Georgia. ""We also pledge our support to Georgia and its people in enhancing their cybersecurity and countering malicious cyber actors. We will offer additional capacity building and technical assistance to help strengthen Georgia’s public institutions and improve its ability to protect itself from these kinds of activities,"" he said. A Fox News request for comment from the Russian U.N. mission about the Russian attack and today’s Security Council meeting were not returned, but as reported last month by the Associated Press, Russia’s Foreign Ministry denied it was involved in the hacking calling the criticism, “unfounded and politically driven.” A spokesman from the U.K. mission to the U.N. told Fox News that: “These cyber-attacks are part of Russia’s long-running campaign of hostile and destabilizing activity against Georgia and part of a wider pattern of malign activity. Actions such as these should be held up for scrutiny.” Before the meeting on Georgia, the council also met behind closed doors on North Korea’s missile launch earlier this week. The U.K., Estonia, France, Germany and Belgium condemned the launch, calling the launches ""provocative actions."" The statement said the testing of ballistic missiles by North Korea was a clear violation of United Nations Security Council resolutions.

Department of Homeland Security officials said they have seen no serious technical difficulties -- nor any increase in disinformation campaigns across the country -- as voters head to the polls for Super Tuesday. Acting Department of Homeland Security Director Chad Wolf and Chris Krebs, the director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, briefed reporters Tuesday after visiting federal, state and local officials at a war room in Arlington, Va. “We have not seen any acute increase in any misinformation, just the constant flow of broader influence operations,” Krebs said. ’S : , Wolf also said the Department of Homeland Security is working with local officials in Tennessee following devastating tornadoes in and around Nashville and advised voters there to get information about any changes to polling locations directly from election officials. However, both officials said overall election systems around the Super Tuesday states were holding up well under a heavy load and proving to be resilient.

Then, it was reported that U.S. intelligence officials had briefed Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders that Russia was trying to help his campaign too, although it was unclear how or why the alleged support for the self-described democratic socialist was occurring. Trump tweeted on Friday, “ , @ and others of the Fake Media, have now added Crazy Bernie to the list of Russian Sympathizers, along with @TulsiGabbard & Jill Stein , both agents of Russia, they say. But now they report President Putin wants Bernie to win.” Trump added, “The reason for this is that the Do Nothing Democrats, using disinformation Hoax number 7, don’t want Bernie Sanders to get the Democrat Nomination, and they figure this would be very bad for his chances. It’s all rigged, again, against Crazy Bernie Sanders!” '' , '' , Contrary to the recent media reports, there is no evidence to suggest that Russia is making a specific ""play"" to boost Trump’s reelection bid, a U.S. intelligence official told Fox News on Sunday. In addition, top U.S. election official Shelby Pierson, who briefed Congress on Russian election interference efforts, may have overstated intelligence regarding the issue when speaking to the House Intelligence Committee earlier this month, the source added. Intelligence agencies have made great strides in preventing Russian interference this year, Fox News also was told. Republican lawmakers who were in the Pierson briefing noted that Trump has taken on Russia in numerous ways, one official present told The Associated Press. The White House has opposed Russia's major proposed pipeline in Germany, provided deadly arms to Ukraine and accused Russia of violating key arms treaties, among other measures. “Has any president in modern American history had to put up with what this president has put up with?” Bongino said, citing the ""fake Russian collusion hoax, part one and two” and his impeachment. “I mean it's been unprecedented,” he continued. “You would think the Democrats who are typically tactically and politically smarter than this would figure out that it’s time to start sticking to the issues and hammering him on the issues that they think would matter, but they can't seem to get away from their dreaded [Trump Derangement Syndrome] and they focus on the personal stuff all the time.”",20,0.0,0.0,0.0,11

He said Russia is relying on a covert social media campaign to divide the American public. Following Sanders' big win in the Nevada caucuses on Sunday, pundit James Carville declared on that Russian President Vladimir Putin was the real winner in the race -- a claim that drew mockery online, even as it remained a dominant theme among establishment pundits.

It was about defending the privilege of neoliberals who lost to Trump in 2016. Bernie is now their biggest threat, so Russiagate is deployed once more.""

2020-02-22,Fox,https://www.foxnews.com/world/5-most-powerful-armies-in-the-world,The 5 most powerful armies in the world,"This is a list of the top 5 most powerful armies in the world. Battlefields are constantly evolving, leading countries around the world to pump hundreds of billions of dollars each year into their armed forces in a race to develop the most advanced training, technology and weaponry. As of 2020, Global Firepower, a website that tracks military strength, says the following five armies are the most powerful, based on a rank given to them after looking at how they compare in categories “ranging from military might and financials to logistical capability and geography”: 5) Japan With an estimated active military personnel of 247,160, this Asian country only has a fraction of the headcount that volatile neighbor North Korea has, but makes up for it with its updated weaponry. Japan has 152 special mission aircraft – more than any country in the world other than the U.S., according to Global Firepower’s statistics – and a formidable Navy fleet that contains 40 destroyers. It also has 3,130 armored vehicles, 1,004 tanks and 119 attack helicopters. Japan is estimated to spend $49 billion on its military in 2020. Japan's armed forces have to contend with a volatile neighbor in North Korea. 4) India India, which has been engaged in a prolonged territorial conflict with nearby Pakistan over the Kashmir region, has an estimated 1,444,000 people actively serving in its armed forces. Global Firepower says the developing nation is amongst the world’s leaders in the number of tanks , towed artillery and fighter aircraft . India is estimated to spend $61 billion on its military this year. India has an estimated 1,444,000 people actively serving in its armed forces. 3) China China, the most powerful country in Asia and a growing adversary to the U.S., ranks third on this list. The communist superpower has an estimated active personnel of 2,183,000 – the largest in the world. China has been building out its Navy in recent years while engaging in territorial disputes across the South China Sea. Today, they have 74 submarines, 52 frigates and 36 destroyers, Global Firepower says. On land, China has 33,000 armored vehicles and 3,500 tanks. Their Air Force has amassed 1,232 fighter aircraft and 281 attack helicopters. China is estimated to spend $237 billion on its armed forces in 2020. China, which has the largest active duty army in the world, is becoming a growing adversary to the U.S. 2) Russia Russia, whose military has become involved in Syria and Ukraine in recent years, has the most tanks of any country in the world: 12,950, more than double what the U.S. has, according to Global Firepower’s statistics. Its estimated 1,013,628 active personnel, on land, are in charge of commanding 27,038 armored vehicles, 6,083 units of self-propelled artillery and 3,860 rocket projectors. In the skies, Russia’s air force has 873 fighter aircraft and 531 attack helicopters. In water, they have 62 submarines and 48 mine warfare ships. Russia is estimated to spend $48 billion on its military this year. Russian soldiers stand near a convoy of rocket launchers in military parade rehearsal on Red Square, Moscow, in 2008. 1) United States In what shouldn’t be a surprise, the U.S. “retains its top spot as the undisputed military power in the world,” Global Firepower says. America has more air units than any other country on Earth, with 2,085 fighters, 967 attack helicopters, 945 transports and 742 special mission aircraft. The U.S. also leads the world with 39,253 armored vehicles, 91 Navy destroyers, and 20 aircraft carriers. It has an estimated 1,400,000 active personnel. Washington has allocated $750 billion to the U.S. military budget in 2020. The U.S., Global Firepower says, is the ""undisputed"" top military power in the world.",7,0.0,0.0,0.0,26

John Kennedy reacts on 'America's Newsroom' to White House counsel Don McGahn being subpoenaed to testify on Capitol Hill and clarifies his comments on the server hacking in 2016. Louisiana Republican Sen. John Kennedy corrected previous comments he made about Russian hacking in 2016 and insisted Ukraine also meddled in the election.
