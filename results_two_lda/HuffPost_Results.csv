Hugo Bachega was reporting from central Kyiv on the escalating conflict after a bridge connecting the annexed area of Crimea to Russia was blown up on Saturday. The Kremlin has blamed the attack on Ukraine. “So the fear is that this could trigger a very strong Russian response. We saw yesterday that a residential area of the city of Zaporizhzhia, a major city in the south of the country, very close to the front lines was hit,” Bachega said, before he was distracted by the sound of an airborne missile. He ducked out of view of the camera as an explosion was heard. The BBC threw it back to the studio, where the anchor said Bachega had taken cover “for obvious reasons.” Within the hour, Bachega delivered another report, noting that the airstrike had hit close to his hotel in the city center. “We understand that several explosions have happened here in the capital, and we had an update from the emergency services saying that several people have been killed and wounded,” he reported. He later posted on Instagram that he was safe, but was having a “busy and depressing day” reporting from a parking lot, ostensibly underground to shelter from airstrikes. A post shared by Hugo Bachega (@hugobachega) At least 11 deaths and scores more injuries were reported Monday after Russia launched a major volley of strikes on cities across Ukraine. At least eight people were killed in Kyiv, according to city officials, with dozens more injured. Many of the locations hit appeared to be residential or key infrastructure sites, the Associated Press reported. Russian President Vladimir Putin said the strikes were ordered in retaliation for the Crimea bridge explosion.",47,,,,24

The Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine — convened in March and staffed by international legal experts — reported the disturbing findings Friday in Geneva, describing a long list of appalling abuses and atrocities by Russian forces. “Based on the evidence gathered by the commission, it has concluded that war crimes have been committed in Ukraine,” Erik Mose, a Norwegian judge and chairman of the three-member commission, said in a statement to the U.N. Human Rights Council. ""War crimes have been committed in Ukraine.""-- Independent International Commission of Inquiry tells @un_hrc. Among the most disturbing crimes the commission has documented involve cases in which children were “raped, tortured and unlawfully confined,” according to the findings. The age of “victims of sexual and gendered-based violence ranged from 4 to 82 years,” Mose said in a statement. In some cases ”relatives were forced to witness the crimes,” Mose noted in his statement. Children were also killed and wounded in “indiscriminate attacks” on civilians by Russian forces using explosive weapons, the investigation found. Commission members “were struck by a large number of executions and other violations by Russian forces, and the Commission received consistent accounts of torture and ill-treatment,” Mose noted in his statement. The commission is continuing to investigate executions in 16 towns and settlements, and has “credible allegations regarding many more cases of executions, which we are documenting further,” Mose added. Many of the examined bodies showed evidence of “prior detention of the victims, as well as visible signs of executions ... such as hands tied behind backs, gunshot wounds to the head, and slit throats,” the commission found. The findings have been consistent with reports of war crimes from other international human rights groups, Western governments and Ukrainian authorities. The U.N. Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine earlier this year documented illegal killings — including summary executions of civilians — in more than 30 settlements in the Kyiv, Chernihiv, Kharkiv and Sumy regions by Russian armed forces while they controlled these areas in late February and March. The Independent International Commission headed by Mose also investigated atrocities in the same areas. Investigators visited 27 towns and settlements and interviewed more than 150 victims and witnesses, according to the report. They also inspected “sites of destruction, graves, places of detention and torture,” as well as remnants of weapons, said Mose.",45,,,,5

Inmates are being offered cash payments and having their sentences commuted to persuade them to sign up for the war in Ukraine. The news comes after Ukraine re-took large parts of previously occupied land in the north and east of the country in what many see as a potential turning point in the war. According to the latest MoD intelligence update, Kremlin-linked private military company the Wagner Group is carrying out the prison recruitment drive. They said the scheme was first launched in July, but has now been “reinvigorated” as Moscow continues to suffer major losses in the war. Latest Defence Intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine - 16 September 2022 Find out more about the UK government's response: #StandWithUkraine 🇺🇦  The MoD said: “Prisoners have been offered commutation of their sentences as well as cash incentives. “This has been reinvigorated, with recently posted video highly likely showing Wagner owner Yevgeny Prigozhin making a recruitment pitch to prisoners. In the video, Prigozhin emphasises that he is only seeking ‘fighters for assault units.’” In a further sign of Russia’s need to get more troops to the frontline, the MoD said Moscow’s military academies “are shortening training courses and bringing cadets graduation dates forwards.” “This is almost certainly so cadets can be deployed to support the Ukraine operation,” they said. “The impact of Russia’s manpower challenge has become increasingly severe. “The acceleration of officer cadets’ training, and Wagner’s demand for assault troops suggests that two of the most critical shortages within the military manning crisis are probably combat infantry and junior commanders.”",7,,,,19

Milley Says Russia Has Failed To Meet Strategic Objectives But War Isn't Over,"Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Mark Milley said Thursday that Russia has failed to meet its strategic objectives in the first six months of President Vladimir Putin’s brutal campaign against Ukraine. Speaking alongside Defense Secretary Austin Lloyd in Germany following a meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group, the top general said the Ukrainian people have shown “superior tactical proficiency” and “a superior will to fight.” “The war is not over, but so far, the Russian strategic objectives have been defeated,” Milley said. Milley added that the U.S. and other allies have helped supply Ukraine with the weapons systems it needs to defend itself, noting the detrimental effect this has had on Russia’s ability to continue fighting. “Russian lines of communication and supply channels are severely strained,” Milley said. He continued: “They’re having great difficulty resupplying their forces and replacing their combat losses.” But Russia on Thursday disputed that Western weapons have helped Ukraine make progress, according to The Associated Press. “The Russian army consistently, with minimal risk for its soldiers and civilians is destroying not only the old weaponry of Soviet models, which the Eastern European countries are discharging, but also the modern NATO weapons,” said Vassily Nebenzia, Russia’s ambassador to the United Nations. Milley also provided a rundown of the war, pointing to Russia’s early strategic failures after it invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24. “They didn’t seize the capital, they didn’t topple the government, they didn’t get to the Dnipro River, and they didn’t seize Odesa,” Milley said, using the Ukrainian name for the Dnieper River. That forced Russian forces to pivot in mid-April and focus instead on seizing the Donbas and holding Odesa at risk, Milley explained. These efforts have also been unsuccessful, he said. “They have only crossed the Dnipro River in the south, in the vicinity of Kherson,” Milley said, adding that at the start of this month the Ukrainians launched their own counteroffensive in the south. Austin on Friday told reporters that Ukraine has recently made progress in this operation. “We see success in Kherson now. We see some success in Kharkiv, and so that is very, very encouraging,” Austin said, according to Reuters. The U.S. officials, though, were keen to emphasize that the conflict is far from over. “Russia’s a big country. They have very serious ambitions with respect to Ukraine. So sustainment of Ukraine to continue their fight for their survival will be necessary,” Milley said. Secretary of State Antony Blinken visited the Ukrainian capital Kyiv as the U.S. released a package of over $2 billion in military support to Ukraine and 18 neighboring countries threatened by Russian aggression, in addition to the $675 million Austin announced just for Ukraine, the AP reported.",7,,,,20

Since Russian President Vladimir Putin’s troops invaded Ukraine in February, the Russian military has lost more than 50,000 troops, 4,500 armored combat vehicles and 2,000 tanks, according to the defense ministry’s Twitter post. “I put numbers on the boards,” the post reads, tagging Pusha T.

More than a million Ukrainians forcibly relocated to Russia since the war in Ukraine started, including more than 180,000 children. An 11-year-old Ukrainian boy, raped as his mother was tied to a chair and forced to watch. The mounting allegations against Russia over its invasion of Ukraine have been described as war crimes or even crimes against humanity. But human rights groups and others are debating if they amount to genocide, at least as defined in international law. Declaring Ukrainians to be the victims of a genocide may not have huge practical implications, but the historic weight of the word, with its overtones of the Holocaust, the killing fields of Cambodia and the breakup of Yugoslavia, may matter more. War crimes and crimes against humanity are deplored, but genocide by its nature implies the need for more forceful, immediate action. And though President Joe Biden has said he thinks it’s genocide, that concern over the obligations the label would impose may be why there’s wariness on Capitol Hill to follow suit. Rep Steny Hoyer (Md.), the second-ranking Democrat in the House and a former chair of the human rights-focused U.S. Helsinki Commission, said he was not sure if the word “genocide” was applicable because he thought of it in terms of ethnic groups. “The way I think about genocide is Hitler getting rid of the Jews or, frankly, to some degree, what we did with Indians or what Christians did to the Muslims because they were Muslims in the Crusades,” he said. Though that perception is widely shared, it’s actually not the definition under international law. “People confuse genocide with mass murder and mass atrocities,” said Azeem Ibrahim, director of special initiatives for the New Lines Institute for Strategy and Policy in Washington, pointing to the definition in a 1948 international treaty. “The number of people being killed is not relevant to what the Genocide Convention actually says. What is relevant is the intent of the parties to eliminate a group in whole or in part using all the various means at their disposal,” he said. If that intent exists, genocide can include: The accusations against Russia certainly check off many of those boxes. Aside from the above incidents cited in a report by New Lines and the Raoul Wallenberg Centre for Human Rights, Russia has been accused of indiscriminately bombing civilian targets, including apartment buildings and malls; blocking the transport of and stealing Ukrainian grain exports; and bombing health care facilities, including a maternity hospital in Mariupol. In April, Dmitry Peskov, a spokesperson for Russian President Vladimir Putin, denied Russian troops had committed atrocities. Russia has also claimed that conditions in the eastern part of Ukraine it had seized were akin to genocide for Russian-speaking people before it invaded. Still, the report by New Lines and the Wallenberg Centre said Russia was guilty of “incitement to commit genocide” and a “pattern of atrocities” from which an intent to destroy the Ukrainian people could be inferred. Human Rights Watch, a New York-based group, said it is observing and documenting what’s happening in Ukraine. Rachel Denber, the group’s deputy director for Europe and Central Asia, said it was documenting “grave breaches” of international law and “heinous acts of murder, torture, inhuman conditions of detention.” “I think it’s really important to focus on the evidence that we are documenting and what it is that our findings are so far because they’re really quite serious. The crime of genocide has a very specific threshold for intent, and while evidence of intent may become apparent, for now the most effective thing we can do is to continue to do our documentation of the conduct of the Russian forces,” she said. But even some old foreign policy hands on Capitol Hill are reluctant to go as far as the human rights community may be headed. “I don’t put this in the same category as the Holocaust,” said Rep. Brad Sherman (D-Calif.), a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee since 1997. “I guess if you looked at the whole of Ukraine together, you could add up a lot of atrocities that might add up to [genocide].” Sherman, who supports aiding Ukraine, said the cost of justice has to be weighed against the costs to the U.S., the costs to the Ukrainians fighting and the risk of a nuclear war. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), a staunch Ukraine supporter, also demurred when asked if he thought Russia had crossed the line. “I’m in favor of helping Ukraine and giving them what they need to beat the Russians,” he said. “If you could walk the streets of Irpin and Hostomel, like I did, and listen to the stories that those people told about what the Russian soldiers did — this is a genocide. The world needs to recognize it as such.” The State Department, which has recognized three instances of genocide since 2021 — the treatment of Muslim Uyghurs in China, the Rohingya in Burma and the Armenians in Turkey in 1915 — also has yet to follow Biden’s lead to add Ukraine to that list. “We are aware of the New Lines Institute report. We are deeply concerned by the report’s findings and by what we are seeing, particularly with respect to the apparent gratuitousness of violence by members of Russia’s forces,” a State Department spokesperson told HuffPost. “That is why we are working with allies and partners to gather, review and preserve evidence of atrocities and make it available to the appropriate bodies to hold those responsible to account.” In the Senate, though, two members of the Foreign Relations Committee have no doubts. “There is no question that what Russia is doing in Ukraine is a genocide,” Sen. Jim Risch (Idaho), the top Republican on the panel, told HuffPost. “If you could walk the streets of Irpin and Hostomel, like I did, and listen to the stories that those people told about what the Russian soldiers did ― this is a genocide. The world needs to recognize it as such,” he said. “I think they’ve passed the international definition of genocide,” said Sen. Ben Cardin (D-Md.). “I thought they passed that a while ago. Transporting people, in some cases unaccompanied children, into Russia with clear intentions of removing them from their culture, that’s genocide.” Under the Genocide Convention, countries are required to take measures to prevent and punish genocide. The U.S., which has signed on to the treaty, has provided assistance to Ukraine to investigate and document “war crimes and other atrocities” in addition to imposing punishing economic sanctions and providing weapons and training to Ukraine. “The ‘prevent’ comes first. The entire purpose of the convention, its primary purpose, is to prevent genocide from happening.” Risch said the United States is already doing a lot, but not enough. “I personally would do more,” he said, declining to elaborate. Risch said he thinks the wariness to call what is happening genocide may stem from unfamiliarity with the definition. “The Holocaust is the Holocaust. This, like many genocides, has its own marks and should be judged in that regard,” he said. Ibrahim, from New Lines, said the focus should not be on whether the definition has been met because the mere risk of genocide, which has been documented in their report, was enough to trigger the genocide treaty’s obligations. The question, he said, was whether the 150-plus countries that signed the Genocide Convention would live up to their obligations. “This is important because what’s happened too often in our lifetimes is whether something is a genocide or not becomes an academic exercise after the fact,” he said. “The ‘prevent’ comes first. The entire purpose of the convention, its primary purpose, is to prevent genocide from happening.”",45,,,,11

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Russia attacked the mall on Monday while over 1,000 people were inside. The attack killed at least 18 people, while 36 remain missing, according to Human Rights Watch. Russia’s defense ministry denied the attack was meant to target civilians, according to Reuters. “In Kremenchuk, Russian forces struck a weapons depot storing arms received from the United States and Europe with high-precision air-based weapons,” the ministry said in a daily statement Tuesday on the state of the war. The Russians also disputed Zelenskyy’s statement that the mall was crowded. “The detonation of stored ammunition for Western weapons caused a fire in a non-functioning shopping centre located next to the depot,” the statement continues. CCTV footage, cited by The Guardian, showed there were two missiles fired in the area within minutes of each other. The first hit the shopping mall, while the second struck a nearby factory, the one Russia claims was used to store weapons. Human Rights Watch said it conducted two in-site investigations at the factory in question and did not uncover any evidence to support Russia’s claims that the facility was used to store military equipment provided by the West. “It’s a place for making road equipment, machines for road construction,” Svitlana Rybalko, from the regional State Emergency Service, told the BBC. “There’s also a greenhouse nearby where workers grow cucumbers.” The BBC reported that the factory is about 300 meters away from the shopping center, separated by a wall and rail tracks. This shows that Russia’s claims that “secondary explosions” are responsible for a fire inside the mall are “unlikely,” the BBC wrote. Witnesses have also cast doubt on Russia’s allegation that the mall was not in operation. The BBC labeled the claim as “false” after talking to several staff and shoppers, including a woman living in a village nearby who regularly visits the area for shopping and said the mall has been “constantly open.” The woman showed the BBC video shot inside the mall two days before the attack, with shoppers walking around and stores open for business. Human Rights Watch said it spoke to 15 people, including local officials and some of those injured in the attack, who confirmed the center was open to the public. Dmitry Polyanskiy, Russia’s deputy ambassador to the United Nations, on Monday presented another allegation ― which contradicts the defense ministry’s statement on Tuesday ― claiming the attack was staged. “Looks like we are dealing with a new #Bucha-style #Ukrainian provocation,” Polyanskiy tweeted. Russia previously claimed that photos and videos of atrocities committed by its soldiers in Bucha, Ukraine, were fake. Looks like we are dealing with a new #Bucha-style #Ukrainian provocation. One should wait for what our Ministry of Defence will say, but there are too many striking discrepancies already. Exactly what Kiev regime needs to keep focus of attention on #Ukraine before #NATOSummit In another Twitter message, reported by the BBC, Polyanskiy said his tweet did not contradict Russia’s Ministry of Defense. Polanskiy added reports of the attack “will be used by Ukraine to attract as much attention as possible through promoting [a] false version of what happened.” Reports of the incident have garnered the attention of world leaders. French President Emmanuel Macron on Tuesday called the attack “a new war crime.” “Russia cannot and should not win,” Macron said at the end of the G-7 summit in Germany, according to The Associated Press. Zelenskyy also addressed the U.N. Security Council on Tuesday saying Russia is a “terrorist state,” committing “daily terrorist acts.” “We need to act urgently to do everything to make Russia stop the killing spree,” Zelenskyy said.",47,,,,23

What Does That Mean For Ukraine War?,"The Kremlin has fired several senior officials managing its invasion of Ukraine, yet another sign that the Russian war effort is significantly faltering. In its latest Twitter update, the British Ministry of Defence (MoD) claimed that Moscow’s centralized command is only going to come under more pressure as it tries to re-establish control behind the scenes. The MoD explained that Russia “has fired senior commanders who are considered to have performed poorly during the opening stages of its invasion of Ukraine.” Lieutenant General Serhiy Kisel, who commanded the elite 1st Guards Tank Army, has been suspended after he was unable to capture Ukraine’s second-largest city Kharkiv. Ukrainian resistance “appear to have won the battle of Kharkiv” according to the U.S. think tank Institute for the Study of War, after Russian units were unable to hold their lines around the city. Russia has been bombarding the city since the war began three months ago, but the troops were not able to even encircle Kharkiv and were subsequently expelled. The commander behind Russia’s Black Sea Fleet, Vice Admiral Igor Osipov, is also likely to have been suspended after the cruiser Moskva sank in April. It was Russia’s flagship Black Sea missile cruiser which was struck down by two Ukrainian missiles, a huge symbolic and military blow to the Kremlin at a time when it was already losing morale. The U.K. officials also think that Russian chief of the General Staff Valeriy Gerasimov is still in post, “but it is unclear whether he retains the confidence of President Putin.” Without a clear command system, the Russian forces – already said to be disorganized and lacking supplies – are unlikely to secure any victories in Ukraine any time soon. As the MoD summarized: “A culture of cover-ups and scape-goating is probably prevalent within the Russian military and security system. “Many officials involved in the invasion of Ukraine will likely be increasingly distracted by efforts to avoid personal culpability for Russia’s operational set-backs. “This will likely place further strain on Russia’s centralized model of command and control, as officers increasingly seek to defer key decisions to their superiors. “It will be difficult for Russia to regain the initiative under these conditions.” Latest Defence Intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine - 19 May 2022 Find out more about the UK government's response: #StandWithUkraine 🇺🇦  There seems to be a major problem with top military officials within the Russian forces right now. Ukraine’s ministry of defense claimed earlier this month that U.S. intelligence has helped it to find and kill 12 Russian generals since the war began. Neither Russia nor the U.S. have confirmed this number, although the U.S. National Security Council later claimed that it was providing “battlefield intelligence” to Ukraine, and did not have intent “to kill Russian generals.” While the details of this claim remain unclear, this is just one of many signs that central control is falling apart in Russia. President Vladimir Putin is also said to have taken over the day-to-day management of the war, despite such tasks typically falling to more junior commanders. “We think Putin and Gerasimov are involved in tactical decision-making at a level we would normally expect to be taken by a colonel or a brigadier,” a Western military source said, according to the Guardian. Yohann Michel, defence and military research analyst at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, told the i newspaper: “If you’re trying to be both general and captain, you are usually doing neither and you are creating uncertainty at every level of the chain of command.” He added: “The Russian armed forces don’t need to have this level of micro-management from the top who have problems of their own.” Russia’s war effort is going so badly even a retired colonel broke rank on state TV and admitted: “Sometimes information is being spread about some sort of psychological breakdown in Ukraine’s Armed Forces, suggesting some sort of a breakthrough is imminent. “None of this has a basis in reality.”",7,,,,19

According to The New York Times, senior American officials said the U.S. had provided real-time battlefield intel to the Ukrainians, including the location of Russia’s mobile military headquarters. Ukraine then used that knowledge, as well as its own intelligence, to conduct artillery strikes and attacks to kill Russian officers. To date, Ukraine said it has killed around 12 Russian generals during the war. The Times added that not all of the airstrikes have relied on American intelligence; Ukraine has its own intelligence-collecting methods. The paper’s sources did not reveal how the U.S. obtained its intelligence and would not specify how many generals may have been killed due to the sharing of that information. The effort is part of a classified push to help Ukraine defend itself, and the Biden administration has been working to keep the full scope of its support secret, the Times reported. The White House fears any open effort to share intelligence could provoke Russian President Vladimir Putin, who has warned the U.S. to stop arming Ukraine, saying there could be “unpredictable consequences” for doing so. Western nations have continued to penalize Russia for the invasion. Earlier this week, the European Union’s top official called on the bloc to ban Russian oil imports and unveiled new sanctions against the country’s biggest bank and media broadcasters. Military analysts fear Putin may use Russia’s upcoming Victory Day holiday — on May 9 — to intensify attacks and mobilize the Russian people for a broader war.",20,,,,3

In his latest address, Zelenskyy said the first 10 soldiers have “received the status of suspects” for engaging in what a growing number of leaders are calling war crimes in the Kyiv suburb. The soldiers are from the 64th Motorized Rifle Brigade of the Russian Ground Forces, according to the president. “Their surnames are known. It is established what they did. We know all the details about them and their actions,” Zelenskyy said. “And we will find everyone – just as we will find all the other Russian thugs who killed and tortured Ukrainians, who tormented our people, who destroyed houses and civilian infrastructure in Ukraine. “None of these bastards will avoid responsibility,” he continued. “However, some of them may not survive until trial and fair punishment. But for one reason only – this Russian brigade was relocated to the Kharkiv region. There, they will get retribution from our military.” Zelensky on Biden’s request for $33 billion for Ukraine: “This is a very important step by the United States. And I am grateful to the American people and personally to President Biden for it. I hope that the Congress will quickly support this request for help to our state.”  Russian forces withdrew from Bucha after at least a month of occupation, leaving behind massive bloodshed. Civilians’ bodies were left on the streets, some charred and some bound by hands and legs. Many of the victims were shot execution-style, particularly men. Pets were also killed and left on the street. Ukraine experienced similar horrors in other towns, like Mariupol, Kharkiv, Chernihiv and Irpin. But the documentation of the terror and death in Bucha shocked the world into coming to terms with the level of violence Russia has perpetrated against civilians. Key players in the United Nations Security Council came together on Wednesday to encourage investigations into the atrocities. The informal meeting included the International Criminal Court’s chief prosecutor, the chair of the United Nations Human Rights Council’s Commission of Inquiry, Ukraine’s top prosecutor, and human rights lawyer Amal Clooney. Ukrainian Prosecutor-General Iryna Venediktova has opened over 8,000 investigations into alleged violations of the laws and customs of war, saying “Russia’s actions amount to crimes against humanity and war crimes” and that the pattern “resembles the crime of genocide.” France’s deputy U.N. ambassador and a co-sponsor of the meeting, Nathalie Broadhurst, said the images of the atrocities in Bucha and other places in Ukraine after Russian forces withdrew “are unbearable” and may amount to war crimes. The U.S. has already concluded that Russia committed war crimes in Ukraine. Russia has denied responsibility for any atrocities, repeatedly claiming that its soldiers are simply rooting out neo-Nazis in the smaller country. “The investigation into the crimes committed by the Russian military against our people is underway,” Zelenskyy said. “Ukraine’s position is absolutely clear – every Russian criminal must be and will be brought to justice. Whoever they are and wherever they hide, we will find them all and make them bear responsibility.”",45,,,,5

Since the war in Ukraine began, reports of sexual violence perpetrated by Russian fighters slowly trickled out of occupied areas. Then, as Russian forces retreated from these regions at the beginning of the month, likely to refocus ground offensive elsewhere, official reports of sexual assault and rape have flooded in. The widespread accounts paint a horrifying picture of how Russian fighters are weaponizing sexual violence and adding to the terror of wartime. The testimonies coming from Ukrainians include gang rapes, assaults taking place at gunpoint, rapes committed in front of victims’ children, as well as torture and mutilation. There have been several reports of Ukrainian women who were raped and then murdered by Russian forces. One Ukrainian woman described on camera how multiple Russian fighters raped her after they rolled into her village with tanks. Another reported that two Russian soldiers murdered her husband on their front lawn and then repeatedly raped her in her basement with her 4-year-old son sobbing in a room down the hall. A group of 15 Ukrainian soldiers, all women, had their heads shaved and were forced to undress and squat for hours while in Russian detention. A dead Ukrainian woman was found in a cellar, shot in the head and naked except for a fur coat, with a used condom and condom wrappers around her. In one of the most abhorrent testimonies, 25 girls and women, ranging from 14 to 24 years old, were locked in a basement and gang-raped repeatedly in Bucha, a city near the capital of Kyiv. Nine of the victims are now pregnant. “Russian soldiers told them they would rape them to the point where they wouldn’t want sexual contact with any man, to prevent them from having Ukrainian children,” said Ukraine’s ombudsman for human rights Lyudmyla Denisova. World leaders have condemned Russia and its president, Vladimir Putin, for the atrocities in Ukraine. President Joe Biden recently called Putin a war criminal, describing the actions of the Russian military as “major war crimes.” U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said earlier this month that the horrors in Bucha were “not the random act of a rogue unit” but a “deliberate campaign to kill, to torture, to rape, to commit atrocities.” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy pleaded for the world to act in a powerful speech to the United Nations Security Council earlier this month. “Women were raped and killed in front of their children. Their tongues were pulled out only because the aggressor did not hear what they wanted to hear from them,” he said after visiting Bucha, which has seen some of the most horrific violence. “Where is the security that the Security Council needs to guarantee? It’s not there. Where is the peace?” Rape has been used as a weapon of war for thousands of years, but it’s not found in every conflict, according to Dara Kay Cohen, a professor of public policy at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard and author of “Rape During Civil War.” For the past decade, Cohen’s work has focused on international relations, civil war and the dynamics of gender and violence in conflicts. The Russia-Ukraine war, however, seems to be ripe for the abuse of sexual violence, Cohen told HuffPost. Ukrainian men ages 18 to 60 were not allowed to leave the country because they will likely be drafted to fight, so the majority of people fleeing the country are women with children and unaccompanied minors. On the other side, about a quarter of the Russian military is made up of conscripts and there have been many reports that a large number of Russian soldiers don’t believe in the cause they’re fighting for. All of this could lead to a perfect storm of sexual violence in conflict. HuffPost spoke with Cohen about how sexual violence is weaponized in conflicts and why armed groups sometimes commit these types of crimes — and what this means in the context of the Russia-Ukraine war. (This interview was edited for brevity and clarity.) How is sexual violence weaponized in conflict zones? There are a huge number of ways that rape is used in wartime. Feminist scholars have argued for a long time about the ways that rape can be used as a form of torture, as a form of humiliation, as a signal that the men of one group can humiliate the men of an enemy group with the message that they can’t protect their women from this terrible violence. It’s been used as a tool of genocide, it’s been used in the context of ethnic wars and non-ethnic wars. But one important point is that rape in wartime is not ubiquitous — it does not happen in every conflict. Even within the context of the same conflict, some armed groups commit sexual violence and other groups do not. One of the keys to understanding why rape happens in wartime is really focusing [on the armed groups themselves] rather than on the region of the world, the country, the level of democracy, etc. All those things might be contributing factors, but what I’ve argued in my research is that the most important part is understanding the armed group that’s committing the sexual violence. What are some indicators that lead you to believe one armed group will commit a higher level of sexual violence than another? One red flag is to look at recent history with these very same military forces. We know … that Russian forces and Russian-backed groups in recent years have committed sexual violence in places like Chechnya, Crimea and in eastern Ukraine. There is a history, a recent history, of this type of violence committed with these same groups. Another red flag is about the composition of the armed groups themselves, the fact that there is conscription. Scholars of civilian victimization and wartime atrocities have found that armed groups that have committed substantial resources to political education use restraint when interacting with civilian populations. Put simply, fighters who know what they’re fighting for or fighters who believe in the cause tend to not abuse civilians to the same extent. We know in Ukraine right now, some Russian fighters have no idea what they’re fighting for and may not believe in the cause very strongly. One of the areas of concern for me and some of my colleagues has been because of what we know about the composition of the Russian forces. Not only are there conscripts, but there also are reports of forced recruitment — literal kidnapping. In other contexts, we have observed those conditions to cause an uptick in sexual violence. Armed groups that recruit their fighters through force are more likely to commit sexual violence. There are also foreign fighters joining the fight in the Ukrainian conflict. That’s another correlate with increased atrocities including increased reports of sexual violence. When there are foreign fighters introduced into someone else’s war, we might expect that these groups suffer from low cohesion. And sexual violence is one consequence of that. “Fighters who believe in the cause tend to not abuse civilians to the same extent. We know in Ukraine right now, some Russian fighters have no idea what they’re fighting for and may not believe in the cause very strongly.” So sexual violence can be a sort of bonding mechanism for fighters in an armed group with low cohesion? That’s correct. There’s a pretty large uptick in reports of multiple perpetrator rape or gang rape, specifically, in the context of wartime. Gang rape is a relatively rare form of sexual violence in peacetime, even in places where rape is quite common. Something like 70% to 80% of reported rape in conflict zones can be gang rape. One of the key factors I found in my research is looking at the function of gang rape, the purpose of gang rape from the perspective of the perpetrating group. I found that gang rape helps armed groups that suffer from low cohesion to essentially overcome that problem. It’s a way of signaling virility and masculinity, which can create social bonds between members of armed groups — particularly members of armed groups that have been forcibly recruited. That sounds relevant to our conversation about the war in Ukraine since about a quarter of the Russian army is made up of conscripts and there have been reports of foreign fighters joining the fight on both sides. There’s a couple of important factors to keep in mind. One is that the people who commit multiple perpetrator rape are, I guess for lack of a better word, more normal or less pathological than people who tend to commit rapes on their own. Many of the contexts I have studied, such as civil wars, these are just ordinary people. These are not criminals. These are not people with a thirst for violence in any way. They’re farmers, they’re students, they’re regular people that have been scooped up by armed groups and beaten and forced to join. It is those same ordinary people who go on to commit these acts of mass rape. There’s a set of studies authored by [Joseph] Vandello on this concept called “precarious manhood.” Vandello and his colleagues argued that if masculinity is threatened, then one way of recovering from the blow of that threat is to perform a physical act, often a violent physical act. In my book, I argue that the act of being forcibly recruited is a major blow to one’s masculinity and one way of recovering that is to perform the ultimate act of physical, hyper-masculine violence: an act of sexualized violence. There have been reports of Russian soldiers using sexual violence as a tool of genocide in Ukraine. Can you talk to me about that? There is evidence that sexual violence has occurred during genocide, although it doesn’t occur during all genocides. We have some examples where sexual contact with the enemy other during a genocide is completely prohibited. It’s not that sexual violence did not occur during the Holocaust, but there were not reports of mass rape or anything close to the levels we knew to happen in other genocides like Rwanda or Bosnia. In the case of the Holocaust, there was a pollution taboo between Jews and Nazis. And, actually, that pollution taboo may have protected folks from being sexually violated. One working hypothesis one of my colleagues [Yale professor] Elisabeth Wood proposed is that rape is actually more likely to occur during a genocide when there was a great deal of intermarriage before the genocide: when there’s close cultural ties between the groups, which seems to be the case in Ukraine and Russia. In the context of genocide, scholars often study what was said to victims and survivors to try to understand the motivations for rape. One of the most concerning reports I believe came out of Bucha where a group of women were [reportedly] held in a basement and raped repeatedly. There were 25 women and girls, and now nine are pregnant. Reports have suggested that the perpetrators told those women things like, “You’ll be raped until no Ukrainian man will want you” or “You’ll be raped so much that we’ll erase the next generation.” That was the implicit — if not explicit — message. Those are all very concerning signs of the genocidal use of sexual violence during conflict. When we discuss rape in wartime, often we only discuss women as victims. Are the majority of victims of sexual violence in conflict zones women? Are there victims of other genders in these situations? That’s a really important question. We know from reports that the majority of victims of sexual violence across conflict contexts are women and girls, but that does not mean that men and boys aren’t also victims of sexual violence. For a long time, scholars approached research on sexual violence assuming that perpetrators are men and victims are women. So, if you wanted to study the question of sexual violence and conflict, you needed to go talk to women. Period. Over time, as we have learned more about how diverse the pools of perpetrators and the pools of victims and survivors are, we’ve gotten much better at asking questions. On a global scale, there are surprisingly large numbers of men and boys who are victimized by sexual violence in contexts of conflict. Really folks of all genders, although there’s diminishingly small evidence because we have a very incomplete evidence base when it comes to LGBTQ+ folks as victims of sexual violence. In some contexts, sexual violence is even more highly stigmatized for men and boys, particularly if the perpetrators are also men. In some contexts, homosexuality is illegal or punishable by death. So, the ability to come forward and report those crimes is really restricted. It’s also the case that in some contexts, rape might be culturally defined as an act of violence that can only happen to women, so even if a man experiences rape it’s not defined as an act of rape. What do we know about what happens to victims in the aftermath of conflict? We know that surviving sexual violence in a conflict is traumatizing. It can have devastating consequences on survivors’ psychological health, on their relationships with their family members, on their relationships with their communities. It can be a terrible and terrifying form of violence to survive. We also know that often it’s not the only thing that a survivor has experienced in conflict. There is a danger in ... assuming it’s the worst thing ... that can happen to a woman in wartime, because that ends up reifying these very patriarchal ideas about women’s sexual purity. It might be the worst thing on the individual level, but we shouldn’t always assume it’s the worst thing. There’s a real concern about creating a hierarchy of harms, as it’s called, and treating sexual violence like it is the ultimate harm that one can suffer. Although women are disproportionately represented among victims of sexual violence, it’s not the case that all women experience sexual violence during conflict, even during mass rape wars. It’s still a relatively rare form of violence compared to forced displacement and other forms of violence that are likely to be much more widespread during conflict. Need help?

The Kremlin has moved the majority of its forces to the east of the country, the Donbas region, but the Ukrainian resistance has been courageously fighting back, as the ministry of defense reported in its Tuesday evening update. The MoD tweeted: “Russia’s ability to progress continues to be impacted by the environmental, logistical and technical challenges that has beset them so far, combined with the resilience of the highly motivated Ukrainian armed forces.” The MoD has previously flagged the declining morale within the Russian ranks, too, stemming from the lack of supplies and personnel. A senior national security official told Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s cabinet on Tuesday that some Russian units were refusing to fight in the war. However, the inability to secure quick victories in Ukraine is likely to make the attacks more aggressive, according to the MoD. The officials tweeted Tuesday: “Russia’s inability to stamp out resistance in Mariupol and their indiscriminate attacks, which have harmed the resident civilian populace are indicative of their continued failure to achieve their aims as quickly as they would like.” For instance, Mariupol, the port town in southeast Ukraine, has been under siege for more than 50 days. But, this could soon change — a marine commander from the region called for help from the international community on Wednesday morning, warning that “the enemy is outnumbering us 10 to one...we have just days or hours left.” Latest Defence Intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine - 19 April 2022 Find out more about the UK government's response: #StandWithUkraine 🇺🇦  Even so, the MoD flags the “resilience of the highly-motivated Ukrainian armed forces” as one of the driving reasons why Russian forces have so far failed in their offensive. The war also seems to have strengthened the west — exactly the opposite of what Putin set out to do. Interim U.S. Ambassador to the U.K., Philip T. Reeker, told Sky News: “Vladimir Putin thought he would find a divided west, a divided alliance, that he would be able to drive wedges. He was sorely mistaken.” He said the NATO alliance is actually stronger than ever now. According to Bloomberg, “More and more top insiders have come to believe that Putin’s commitment to continue the invasion will doom Russia to years of isolation and heightened tension.” The Kremlin insiders, who spoke on condition of anonymity, allegedly fear this will compromise the country’s security, economy and global influence, as the world has reacted in horror at Russia’s alleged attacks on civilians. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has repeatedly warned that this war will scar Russia for years to come, writing on Telegram in his nightly update that the “vileness” of the invasion “will mark the Russian state as a source of absolute evil for generations.” Russian soldiers liberated thousands of Ukrainian homes from:🚽 combat toilets📺 armored TV-sets💻 fighting laptops🎧 tactical earphones👕👟👙 clothes💄 makeup...and thousands of other dangerous NATO items...Let their deeds be forever remembered 🥀🥀  However, Bloomberg adds in its summary: “Many powerful players are too fearful of the widening crackdown on dissent to voice their concerns in public.” Instead, it believes: “Putin is determined to push on with the fight, even if the Kremlin has had to reduce its ambitions from a quick, sweeping takeover of much of the country to a gruelling battle for the Donbas region in the east.”",7,,,,19

With a “significant part of the entire Russian army” now deployed in the region, according to Zelenskyy, here’s what you need to know about what could be a turning point in the conflict. On February 24, Russia invaded neighboring Ukraine. Tanks and soldiers streamed across the border, in scenes more reminiscent of World War II than the remote cyber warfare that modern conflict was supposed to be dominated by. Russia’s invasion has damaged or destroyed up to 30% of Ukraine’s infrastructure at a cost of $100 billion, Ukrainian officials have said, as the United Nations revealed the civilian death toll has now surpassed 2,000. About 4 million Ukrainians have fled the country. But Russia’s swift march to victory did not materialize. Driven back by Ukrainian resistance in the north, Moscow has refocused its ground offensive in the two eastern provinces known as the Donbas, while launching long-distance strikes at other targets including the capital, Kyiv. The Donbas is Ukraine’s mostly Russian-speaking industrial heartland in the east, where Moscow-backed separatists have been fighting Ukrainian forces for the past eight years and have declared two independent republics that have been recognised by Russia. In recent weeks, the Kremlin declared the capture of the Donbas its main goal of the war after its attempt to storm Kyiv failed. After withdrawing from the capital, it began regrouping and reinforcing its ground troops in the east for what could be a climactic battle. On Monday, Ukraine military generals said Russian forces were increasing assaults in the Luhansk and Donetsk regions — both of which are part of the Donbas — as well as in the area of Zaporizhzhia. They also said Russia was sending reinforcements to the Crimean peninsula — seized from Ukraine in 2014 — and to the Rostov-on-Don area, which borders Ukraine. Zelenskyy’s chief of staff Andriy Yermak called it “the second phase of the war” and assured Ukrainians that their forces could hold off the offensive. “Believe in our army, it is very strong,” he said. The Associated Press reported a senior U.S. defense official saying there are now 76 Russian combat units in eastern and southern Ukraine, up from 65 last week. That could translate to around 50,000 to 60,000 troops. ⚡️Foreign minister: Battle of Donbas will be similar to World War II.“This will not be a local operation based on what we see from Russia’s preparations,” Dmytro Kuleba said, adding that he expects large-scale operations involving thousands of tanks, armored vehicles, aircraft. Russia’s stuttering campaign means control of eastern Ukraine has taken added significance, and may prompt the fiercest fighting yet. Russia needs some kind of “win”— recognizing Russia’s claims in the Donbas and Crimea has also been the central plank of Vladamir Putin’s demands at failed peace talks — and following the sinking of its Black Sea lead ship, Putin will not be contemplating further embarrassment. The new offensive in the east came as a Russian missile attack killed seven people in Lviv, the first civilian victims in the western city about 40 miles from Poland. It was one of a multitude of other targets across Ukraine in what appeared to be an intensified bid to grind down the country’s defenses. Lviv has seen only sporadic attacks during almost two months of war and has become a haven for civilians fleeing the fighting elsewhere. Now President Zelensky, in a new public address, says Russia has begun the battle for the Donbas and concentrated a large part of its army there for an all-out offensive in eastern Ukraine.  In other developments, Ukrainian troops remained holed up at a mammoth steel mill in Mariupol, the last known pocket of resistance in the devastated southern port city. The capture of Mariupol, where Ukraine estimates 21,000 people have been killed, is seen as key, and not just because it would deprive Ukraine of a vital port and complete a land bridge between Russia and the Crimean peninsula. General Richard Dannatt, a former head of the British Army, told Sky News that Russia is waging a “softening-up” campaign ahead of the Donbas offensive. The U.S. defense official said that if Russian forces succeed in taking full control of Mariupol, that could free up nearly a dozen combat units for use elsewhere in the Donbas. Given the changing dynamics of the war, Ukraine is calling for an increasing supply of Western weapons. Last week, U.S. President Joe Biden announced an additional $800 million in military assistance to Ukraine, expanding the aid to include heavy artillery ahead of the wider Russian assault expected in eastern Ukraine. The U.S. military expects to start training Ukrainians on using howitzer artillery in coming days, with the training taking place outside Ukraine.

The city of Mariupol has gained international attention in part due to the vast documentation of its nonstop destruction at the hands of the Russian military. The shell of a city appeared on the brink of falling to the Russians on Sunday after Ukrainian defenders did not submit to Moscow’s midday deadline for their surrender, but Shmyhal maintained that the city still belongs to Ukraine. “No, [the] city still has not fallen. There is still our military forces, our soldiers, so they will fight to the end. As for now, they still are in Mariupol,” he told George Stephanopoulos on ABC’s “This Week.” “But there is [a] huge humanitarian catastrophe because there is more than 100 civilians which are suffering for more than 40 days of this humanitarian crisis … in this besieged city,” he continued. “And they have no water, no food, no heat, no electricity. And we ask all of our partners to support and help to stop this humanitarian catastrophe in Mariupol.” Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal tells @GStephanopoulos that the city of Mariupol has not yet fallen to Russian forces because Ukrainian soldiers “will fight till the end.” “But there is a huge humanitarian catastrophe.”  Mariupol has been under relentless attack by Russian forces that pounded most of the buildings and, according to Ukraine, killed at least 21,000 people. Russian military fired a lethal airstrike at a maternity hospital in the first couple of weeks of the invasion, and about 300 Ukrainians were reported killed in a theater where civilians, including children, were taking shelter. The city was home to about 450,000 before Russia invaded. An estimated 100,000 now remain, according to The Associated Press. The Russian military claims that about 2,500 Ukrainian fighters are holding out at a steel plant in the last pocket of resistance in Mariupol. That claim could not be independently verified. This is “what the Russian Federation did, deliberately did. And deliberately continues to destroy cities. Russia is deliberately trying to destroy everyone who is there in Mariupol,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Saturday in a virtual address, adding that the situation in the port city remains as “severe as possible” and that the devastation is “just inhuman.” Capturing Mariupol would be Russian President Vladimir Putin’s biggest victory in Ukraine after two months of costly fighting, major military deaths and forced withdrawal from some cities, as well as a worsening economy in Russia from increasing Western sanctions. The nuclear superpower also recently faced the humiliating loss of the flagship of its Black Sea Fleet to what Ukraine claimed was a missile attack. Russia’s potential seizure of Mariupol would allow Putin to secure a land corridor to the Crimean Peninsula — which it annexed from Ukraine in 2014 — and deprive the smaller country of a major port. The seizure would also allow more Russian troops to be available for the offensive on the east. Shmyhal said Sunday that Ukraine will try to stop the war “in any way,” including diplomatically when possible. But if Russians refuse to negotiate in good faith, “we will fight to the end, absolutely.” “We will not surrender. We won’t leave our country, our families, our land,” he continued. “So we will fight absolutely to the end, to win in this war.”",47,,,,8

They just killed people, not soldiers. People. They just shot people in the streets,” he told CNN’s Jake Tapper of the numerous atrocities seen throughout the country since the start of Russia’s invasion, while highlighting the slaughter of people in Bucha, a suburb of Kyiv, in particular. “These were not soldiers; they were civilians. They bound their hands; they forced children to watch as they raped their mothers; then they threw them in a well or in mass graves. Children, adults, the elderly. And we have substantial evidence that points to this being a genocide, audio and video where they talk about just how much they hate us,” he said in an interview that aired in full Sunday. Ukrainian President Volodymyr @ZelenskyyUa tells CNN's @jaketapper that his country has ""substantial evidence"" that Russia is committing genocide. #CNNSOTU  Video and satellite images taken in Bucha in recent weeks show bodies lining the streets while Russia’s military was in control of the region, rebutting Russia’s claim that the bodies had been placed there after its military left. Some of the bodies were seen with their hands bound behind their backs and gunshot wounds to the head. Zelenskyy, a father of two, expressed particular heartbreak over a recent video circulating that shows a mother finding her child’s body down a well in the village of Buzova near Kyiv. He called the video “the most horrifying thing I have seen in my life.” “I can’t watch it as a father, only because all you want after this is revenge and to kill. I have to watch it as the president of a state where a lot of people have died and lost their loved ones,” he said. “And there are millions of people who want to live. All of us want to fight. But we all have to do our best for this war not to be endless. The longer it is, the more we would lose.” He further shared his belief that the violence could escalate beyond Ukraine’s borders, stressing that Russia could use chemical or nuclear weapons and the rest of the world should “be ready.” “For them, life of the people is nothing,” he said. President Joe Biden on Tuesday also said he believes the killings in Ukraine are genocide but that he will “let the lawyers decide, internationally, whether or not it qualifies.” French President Emmanuel Macron, who has engaged in diplomatic discussions with Russian President Vladimir Putin since the start of the war, has meanwhile stopped short of using such a label, saying an “escalation of words” won’t bring peace. Zelenskyy said he has addressed Macron directly about that opinion and has invited the French leader, as well as Biden, to visit Ukraine to see the death and destruction firsthand. “He’ll come and see, and I am sure he will understand,” Zelenskyy said of Macron. Genocide is a crime recognized under international law as an act that intends “to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group,” according to the Genocide Convention, which was ratified by the U.S. in 1988. The U.S. has recognized genocide only eight times since the Holocaust, with the government most recently in March accusing Myanmar of committing genocide against its minority Rohingya population. That recognition came nearly five years after the peak of the violence and follows similar recognitions by other countries, including Canada, France and Turkey.",45,,,,21

He pointed to the horrifying tragedy to again plead for the international community to give Ukraine “all necessary heavy weapons” and planes “immediately” to defend itself against the brutal invading forces. “I want to be heard right now: There has not been a single day since the blockade of Mariupol that we have not sought a solution — military or diplomatic, anything to save people. But finding this solution is extremely difficult. So far, there is no 100% valid option,” Zelenskyy said. Russia’s defense ministry claimed on Saturday that beyond a small Ukrainian group of fighters still left, Russian forces had “completely cleared” Mariupol.

We cannot rest now.” The aid package includes radars, drones, armored vehicles, body armor and ammunition, according to a Pentagon statement later in the day. Six weeks into its attack on Ukraine, Moscow is now focused on capturing two regions in the east of the country, Luhansk and Donetsk, Ukrainian officials and military analysts say. Fresh U.S. shipments could help Ukrainian troops stop Russia from capturing strategic towns and supply routes. “This will be a knife fight. This could be very bloody and very ugly,” a senior American defense official said of the next phase of the war in a briefing with reporters last week. In preparation, the U.S. also recently allocated $100 million in anti-tank Javelin systems for Ukraine. Biden has already directed more than $2.4 billion in military support and more than $300 million in humanitarian aid to the country. Congress last month approved nearly $10 billion for such programs. American allies including Britain, Australia, Slovakia and other nations are also pumping supplies, such as air defense equipment and medical gear, to the Ukrainians. Russia’s vicious approach to the conflict ― including the apparent mass murder of everyday Ukrainians in occupied areas and repeated strikes on civilian targets ― has made Ukraine even more determined to resist. Between the evidence of atrocities and Ukraine’s battlefield prowess so far, Ukrainian activists and officials say there is a clear imperative for foreign governments to provide all the help they can. And Russian President Vladimir Putin seems set on further fighting, too. He recently appointed a new top commander for the war — one who led brutal assaults in Russia’s intervention in Syria, according to U.S. intelligence. Putin said Tuesday that he sees peace talks as dead. “Putin is just trying to wipe out the idea of even being a Ukrainian,” Biden said on Tuesday. He suggested that Washington views Russia’s campaign as “genocide,” and he has previously called Putin a war criminal.",7,,,,0

Biden later doubled down on his comments in remarks to reporters, saying lawyers would decide whether Russia’s actions meet the international definition of genocide, “but it sure seems that way to me.” “Yes, I called it genocide — it’s become clearer and clearer that Putin is just trying to wipe out the idea of even being a Ukrainian,” he added. Previously, the president had condemned the Kremlin’s attacks on Ukraine by saying Putin was a “war criminal” and should face a trial for war crimes. The United Nations defines genocide as killing or causing serious harm to a group — national, ethnic, racial or religious — with the intent to destroy the group in whole or in part. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who had previously described Russia’s actions as genocide, responded to Biden’s remarks on Twitter: “Calling things by their names is essential to stand up to evil.” He added that Ukrainians “urgently need more heavy weapons to prevent further Russian atrocities.” Since Russia began its attack on Ukraine in late February, the U.N. has tracked nearly 2,000 deaths and over 2,500 injuries, noting the actual numbers are likely “considerably higher,” with reports of mass deaths in some areas, including Mariupol, still to be confirmed. Mariupol’s mayor said this week that over 10,000 civilians in his city have died in Russian attacks. Over 4 million Ukrainians have fled their country due to the violence. Earlier this week, Rep.

Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) said Sunday that Russia’s brutal attacks on Ukraine constitute genocide, a term the White House has so far avoided using when talking about the war. Cheney appeared on CNN’s “State of the Union,” where she spoke with host Jake Tapper about the mass killing of Ukrainian civilians since Russia invaded the neighboring country. “I think this clearly is genocide. I think that you asked exactly the right questions,” she told Tapper. “I think that Europe needs to understand and grapple with the fact that you’ve got a genocidal campaign ― the first kind of horrific genocidal campaign that we have seen certainly in recent decades.” ""I think this is clearly a genocide.""CNN's @jaketapper asks Rep. Liz Cheney (R-WY) about a missile strike on a Ukrainian train station that left dozens dead and how she thinks European allies should respond. #CNNSOTU @CNNSotu  Article II of the United Nations Genocide Convention defines genocide as “any of the following acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group” ― followed by a list of actions such as “killing members of the group,” “imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group,” “forcibly transferring children of the group to another group,” and deliberately inflicting “conditions of life” meant to bring about the group’s physical destruction. The U.N. treaty has been criticized since its 1948 adoption, both by those who feel its definition of genocide is too narrow and others who believe the term can be applied to too many situations. As defined by the treaty, the most recent act of genocide took place in 1994 in Rwanda. The International Criminal Court, however, issued an arrest warrant for Sudan’s president in 2010 on genocide charges; the U.S. in 2016 accused the Islamic State of genocide in Iraq and Syria; Gambia submitted a case to the International Court of Justice in 2017 accusing of Myanmar of genocide against Rohingyas; and several nations formally accused China last year of genocide against the Uyghurs in Xinjiang. Ukrainian officials, including President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, have described Russia’s attacks on civilians as a genocide ― raising comparisons to the horrors of the Holodomor, where millions of Ukrainians died of a famine engineered by the Soviet government in 1932. The International Criminal Court’s prosecutor is currently conducting an investigation on the atrocities stemming from the Russian invasion. Though White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan was comfortable saying Russia’s actions constitute war crimes, he hesitated on Sunday to describe the attacks as genocide. “Look, in my opinion, the label is less important than the fact that these acts are cruel and criminal and wrong and evil and need to be responded to decisively. And that is what we are doing,” Sullivan told Tapper. “And we’re doing that not just by supporting international investigations and gathering evidence to hold the perpetrators all the way to the highest levels accountable. We’re doing it by providing sophisticated weapons to the Ukrainians that are making a major difference on the battlefield.” Congress voted on Thursday to suspend normal trade relations with Russia and to ban oil imports, while the European Union approved an embargo on coal imports. The U.N. General Assembly voted to suspend Russia from its Human Rights Council. Sullivan pointed out that banning oil imports is harder for European countries that are much more reliant on Russian energy. The U.S. is “surging exports of U.S. liquefied natural gas to Europe” so other countries can wean off Russian oil and gas. Cheney said Sunday that European nations need to pull the plug on Russian imports if they truly support Ukraine in the war. “Europeans need to understand that they’re funding that genocidal campaign,” she told Tapper. “I understand the economic consequences to countries in Western Europe, if they were to impose the kind of oil and gas embargo that the U.S. has imposed against Russian oil and gas, but they need to do it. And we need to do everything we can to increase our own domestic production, to help make sure that we can supply them with as much as possible.” “But they need to understand that every single time, every single day that they are continuing to import Russian oil and gas,” she went on, “they’re funding Putin’s genocide in Ukraine.”",45,,,,20

In a Twitter post shared Thursday morning, the ministry of defense explained how the Russians have shifted their lines of attack. It wrote: “Progressing offensive operations in eastern Ukraine is the main focus of Russian military forces. “Russian artillery and air strikes continue along the Donbas line of control.” The Donbas region is in eastern Ukraine, and encapsulates Donetsk and Luhansk — areas partially occupied by pro-Russian rebels since the annexation of Crimea back in 2014. This renewed focus on the east comes after troops withdrew from the Kyiv region — leading to the discovery of the Bucha massacre. The U.K. officials also pointed out that Russian forces are trying to impact Ukrainian supplies. “Russian strikes against infrastructure targets within the Ukrainian interior are likely intended to degrade the ability of the Ukrainian military to resupply and increase pressure on the Ukrainian government.” However, the intelligence suggests that actually it is the Russians who are facing supply shortages – along with a lack of morale among its dwindling workforce. The ministry of defense tweeted: “Despite refocusing forces and logistics capabilities to support operations in the Donbas, Russian forces are likely to continue facing morale issues and shortages of supplies and personnel.” Latest Defence Intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine - 7 April 2022 Find out more about the UK government's response: #StandWithUkraine 🇺🇦  Russian losses are certainly high. At the end of last month, NATO estimated that up to 40,000 soldiers had been killed, wounded, captured or missing in action. This number is expected to have increased in April as Ukrainians managed to push the Russians out of various cities, including Kyiv and Kharkiv. Pentagon Press Secretary John Kirby went even further than the ministry of defense, and expressed his belief that the Ukrainian troops can win the war this week. He told reporters on Wednesday: “Mr Putin has achieved exactly zero of his objectives inside Ukraine. “He didn’t take Kyiv. He didn’t topple the government. He didn’t remove Ukraine as a nation state. “And, he’s really only taken control of a small number of population centers and even those weren’t the ones he was really going after.” He pointed out even Mariupol has not been taken – “the proof is literally in the outcomes you are seeing every day.” Mr Putin has achieved exactly zero of his objectives inside Ukraine. He didn’t take Kyiv. He didn’t topple the government. He didn’t remove Ukraine as a nation state.  Yet, a previous update from the Ministry of Defense, posted on Wednesday, explained that Ukrainians are still suffering, significantly, despite their various successes. For instance, Mariupol, the coastal city in the east of Ukraine, is now under siege as the Russians attempt to cut off their links to the outside world. “The humanitarian situation in the city [of Mariupol] is worsening,” officials explained. “Most of the 160,000 remaining residents have no light, communication, medicine, heat or water. “Russian forces have prevented humanitarian access, likely to pressure defenders to surrender.”",7,,,,8

The reports are consistent with claims by the Mariupol City Council that Russians have kidnapped 20,000 Mariupol residents, according to an English translation of a March 29 post on the council’s Telegram channel. Russian soldiers have transported Ukrainians, including patients and staff from at least two Mariupol maternity hospitals, through Russian-controlled parts of eastern Ukraine, NPR reported. The woman told The Guardian she was among a group of roughly 200 to 300 people who were taken to Novoazovsk, Ukraine, via bus. That’s when they recognized they had arrived at a “filtration camp,” a series of military tents run by the Russian military where those arriving faced interrogation and confiscation of personal items before they were eventually moved to Russia. The woman said she had her photo and fingerprints taken, and was questioned about potential ties to the Ukrainian military and her opinion on the war before being sent to the Russian town of Rostov. Others have reported they had to hand in their phones and passwords, which officers then used to access their phone contacts and register them into a database, according to The Washington Post. The woman left the group after telling the soldiers she had family in the area and has since made her way to the E.U. “Such reports are lies,” said Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov. Unlawful deportations constitute war crimes, according to the United Nations. President Joe Biden said Putin is a “war criminal” and should face trial, pledging additional sanctions following atrocities documented in Bucha. Moscow said in March it rescued 420,000 people “from dangerous regions of Ukraine, the Donetsk and Luhansk People’s Republics” and evacuated them to Russia. U.S. intelligence warned before the invasion that Russia may resort to its past practices of unlawful detentions. “These acts, which in past Russian operations have included targeted killings, kidnappings/forced disappearances, unjust detentions, and the use of torture, would likely target those who oppose Russian actions,” Bathsheba Crocker, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, wrote in a letter to the U.N. The term “filtration camps” originated in the Soviet Union at the end of World War II. Soviet citizens that had been living outside the country who then sought to return — even those forcibly taken to Germany as war criminals — were deemed “suspect.” They had to be screened in camps and holding stations before they were readmitted into the Soviet Union or deported, according to U.K. history professor Nick Baron. In February 2000, Human Rights Watch issued a report detailing excessive violence and rape committed by Russian forces inside a filtration camp in Chechnya, following a 1999 offensive against Chechen rebels during Putin’s first month in power. The aggression offset an earlier Russian setback that forced Russia to remove its forces from the region and sign a treaty that gave Chechnya, a majority Muslim republic, large autonomy in 1996, according to NPR. Russia emerged triumphant this time, with Putin celebrating his victory in March 2000. The ongoing Ukraine war has worried those who have followed Chechnya. “There are some pretty disturbing parallels,” Thomas de Waal, a journalist who covered the area in the 1990s, told NPR. “The use of heavy artillery, the indiscriminate attacking of an urban center. They bring back some pretty terrible memories for those of us who covered the Chechnya war of the 1990s.” The southern port city of Mariupol, where those taken to filtration camps originated, has borne the brunt of Russian cruelty and faces continued bombardments.

Ukrainian authorities and journalists have seen evidence of widespread civilian casualties in Bucha, a suburban area northwest of Kyiv. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken described the casualties as evidence of “a deliberate campaign to kill, to torture, to rape” ― not “the random act of a rogue unit.” President Joe Biden on Monday called for Russian President Vladimir Putin to be held accountable for the violence, which he described as a war crime. Russia has repeatedly asserted that the violence was committed after its forces left the region. Blinken, however, said Tuesday that reports of atrocities committed by the Russians are “more than credible.” “I’m addressing you on behalf of the memory of the deceased,” Zelenskyy told the U.N. council. “They died suffering.” He alleged that Russian troops searched for and killed “anyone who served our country,” including entire families, executing many people in the street. Other people were thrown in wells, Zelenskyy claimed, and some had their limbs or tongues removed. Photographs showed that some of the dead had their hands tied behind their backs. The world has yet to see the full extent of the brutality, Zelenskyy added. The Russians’ behavior is “no different than ISIS,” Zelenskyy said. “And here it is done by a member of the United Nations Security Council.” The Ukrainian leader condemned the group, whose permanent members include the Russian Federation, for not doing more to end the conflict. He proposed three options: Remove Russia from the security council, reform the council, or dissolve it completely. Citing what he called Ukraine’s “moral right” to propose reforms, Zelenskyy argued that Russia’s veto power makes the council worthless in fulfilling its main purpose of peacekeeping. There is currently no process for removing a member of the security council. “Accountability must be inevitable,” Zelenskyy said. The Ukrainian delegation sent a video to be played following the president’s remarks, but technical issues prevented it from being shown immediately afterward. U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield subsequently announced that the U.S. would seek to suspend Russia from the United Nations Human Rights Council, noting that Russia has used false allegations of human rights abuses on the part of Ukraine to justify its invasion.",45,,,,8

See what bastards you’ve raised,” Zelenskyy posted on his Telegram channel. “Murderers, looters, butchers.” Some of the graphic scenes the president was referring to are shown below. Such photos and videos have been coming out of cities like Bucha and the Kyiv suburbs of Irpin and Hostomel, which Zelenskyy adviser Oleksiy Arestovych said looked like a “scene from a horror movie.” Ukrainian troops have discovered brutalized bodies and widespread destruction in the area outside the capital. Authorities said they are documenting evidence as Ukraine’s military reclaims territory and Russian soldiers withdraw to focus on targeting fuel and ammunition supplies in southern and eastern Ukraine. Graphic photos from Bucha showed bodies in the streets, some that Associated Press journalists in the area noted had their hands tied behind their backs and had been killed at what appeared to be close range. Other bodies were found wrapped in plastic, bound with tape and tossed in a ditch. Arestovych said some civilians were shot in the head, and some bodies showed signs of torture, rape and burning. Zelenskyy on Sunday also slammed NATO for not inviting Ukraine to accession talks in 2008. During the alliance’s summit that year in Bucharest, Romania, members invited Albania and Croatia to accession talks with NATO. “The many years of hard work within the Membership Action Plan have paid off,” the NATO secretary-general said at the summit. “Due to your hard work, Allies can be confident that your admission to the Alliance will strengthen NATO.” The alliance was also tasked with deciding whether to provide Georgia and Ukraine with MAP status. Neither nation received such status, and they were left with an open-ended promise of eventual, potential membership. “Bucharest, NATO Summit Declaration. April 3, 14 years ago. There was a chance to prevent, so that Russia did not come,” Zelenskyy wrote in the same Telegram post on Sunday. “Bucha, Kyiv region. Now. Russia has come.” U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken was asked on Sunday about the prospect of guaranteeing security to Ukraine should the country commit to neutrality as part of a negotiation with Russia to end the war. “All of this is up to the Ukrainians, which is to say that, if they negotiate something that meets their needs, that preserves their sovereignty, their independence, we will back it,” Blinken told CNN’s “State of the Union.” “And we’re not going to be less Ukrainian than Ukrainians. We’re not going to be more Ukrainian than Ukrainians. So, first and foremost, it’s up to them, to their elected representatives, to President Zelenskyy. “When it comes to the future, we and allies and partners are going to want to make sure that we do everything we can to ensure that this can’t happen again and that Ukraine has the means to defend itself, to deter the Russian aggression,” he continued. “So, we will look at anything that we can do to back up that kind of outcome.”",45,,,,18

Although the devastating attacks on Ukraine continue, there is a general consensus that the war has not exactly gone according to the Russian president’s plan and troops have moved back from the capital of Kyiv. Here’s what officials from the U.K. and the U.S. have said about Russia’s efforts: U.K. Defense Secretary Ben Wallace ripped into Putin over his military failures in Ukraine on Thursday, and declared that the Russian president is now caught “in a cage he built himself.” Wallace told Sky News: “President Putin is not the force he used to be. “He is now a man in a cage he built himself. His army is exhausted, he has suffered significant losses. “The reputation of this great army of Russia has been trashed. “He has not only got to live with the consequences of what he is doing to Ukraine, but he has also got to live with consequences of what he has done to his own army. “We have seen it before. It always get worse. It goes for more civilian attacks, more civilian areas.” Russia has repeatedly denied that it is attacking civilian areas as part of its “special military operation” in Ukraine, despite evidence that bomb shelters and maternity hospitals have been targeted. 'President Putin must recognise that his three or four-day plan is now in day 36"".Defence Secretary Ben Wallace says Russia's invasion of Ukraine is ""definitely not going to plan"". Sky 501, Virgin 602, Freeview 233 and YouTube  Admiral Sir Tony Radakin, the U.K.’s chief of defense staff, expressed a similar point of view when he said Russia’s attempts to seize the whole of Ukraine have “fallen apart.” Speaking at an Institute for Government event on Thursday, he said that Putin was a “weaker and more diminished figure” than he was prior to the invasion — while “NATO is stronger and more united today than at any time I can remember.” He also alleged that Putin had been “misled” about how effective his forces were amid reports that Russia is withdrawing from Ukraine. Some Kremlin aides are allegedly too afraid to tell the president how the invasion is actually going, although Moscow has denied this charge. Radakin also said that the Kremlin appeared to be moving the emphasis onto the east and south of Ukraine, but predicted: “Ukraine armed forces will attack those Russian forces as they retreat.” He also said: “In many ways, Putin has already lost. Far from being the far-sighted manipulator of events that he would have us believe, Putin has damaged himself through a series of catastrophic misjudgements. “Like all authoritarians, he allowed himself to be misled as to his own strength, including the effectiveness of the Russian armed forces.” Sir Jeremy Fleming, head of GCHQ intelligence agency, shared a similar warning Wednesday. He said: “Even though we believe Putin’s advisers are afraid to tell him the truth, what’s going on and the extent of these misjudgements must be crystal clear to the regime.” On Thursday night, the ministry of defense tweeted that Russia is now redeploying elements of its military forces from Georgia. It claimed: “It is highly unlikely that Russia planned to generate reinforcements in this manner and it is indicative of the unexpected losses it has sustained during the invasion.” Latest Defence Intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine - 31 March 2022 Find out more about the UK government's response: #StandWithUkraine 🇺🇦  The Kyiv Independent shared the Ukraine’s Armed Forces estimates when it comes to what Russia has lost since the war began on February 24.

The newspaper’s defense reporter Illia Ponomarenko also tweeted: “Russians basically came to Kyiv with an unbelievably stupid and unrealistic plan, killed a lot of people, ruined a lot of homes, and sustained heavy casualties. No results, no reserves. “Now they just have to leave before they get slaughtered in a pocket northwest of Kyiv.” These are the indicative estimates of Russia’s combat losses as of April 1, according to the Armed Forces of Ukraine.

In the U.S., the White House claimed there has been “incontrovertible evidence” that the war on Ukraine has “been a strategic disaster for Russia” on Thursday. U.S. President Joe Biden’s communications director Kate Bedingfield told the press that Russia was trying to “redefine the initial aims of their invasion” as a result. She continued: “We have information that Putin felt misled by the Russian military, which has resulted in persistent tension between Putin and his military leadership.” She also pointed out that it is becoming clearer Putin’s war will leave Russia “isolated on the world stage.”",7,,,,10

He overestimated the abilities of his military to secure a rapid victory,” Fleming said in a Thursday speech in Australia. “Short of weapons and morale,” the Russians downed their own aircraft by mistake, he added. Fleming also confirmed that Moscow has deployed mercenaries and foreign fighters as part of its operation. The GCHQ (Government Communications Headquarters) is a top partner for U.S. intelligence, and Fleming’s statement is his first public comment on the Ukraine war since the invasion began on Feb. 24. “Even though we believe Putin’s advisers are afraid to tell him the truth, what’s going on and the extent of these misjudgements must be crystal clear to the regime,” Fleming continued. Russia’s military has lost seven generals and at least 7,000 soldiers as Ukrainian forces have resisted the easy Russian victory that analysts say Putin expected. Russian forces are enduring many more casualties in their ongoing bid to capture the strategic port city of Mariupol, according to a March 30 assessment of the war from the Institute for the Study of War think tank in Washington. “Russia is withdrawing some elements of its forces around [the Ukrainain capital of] Kyiv... for likely redeployment,” analysts Mason Clark, George Barros and Kateryna Stepanenko wrote. “But Russian forces will likely continue to hold their forwardmost positions and shell Ukrainian forces and residential areas.” Russia has repeatedly struck civilian targets, such as hospitals and shelters, in recent weeks, and Western officials worry that it will become more aggressive in doing so ― including by using banned chemical weapons and claiming the Ukrainians have done so. Fleming referred to that risk in his address: “On this and many other subjects, deeply secret intelligence is being released to make sure the truth is heard.

As the ship burns, at least two other ships are seen leaving the port with what appeared to be smaller fires burning on them. “The destroyed ship in Berdyansk could carry up to 20 tanks, 45 armored personnel carriers and 400 paratroopers,” the Ukrainian deputy defense minister, Hanna Malyar, said in a statement on Thursday, according to The New York Times. “This is a huge target that was hit by our military.” Ukrainian officials said two additional ships were damaged by Ukrainian forces and a 3,000-ton fuel tank was also destroyed, igniting a fire that spread to nearby ammunition supplies, according to The Associated Press.

Gen. James Marks put the blame for Russia’s faltering invasion of Ukraine firmly on Russian President Vladimir Putin and his excessive pride. Marks, now a military analyst for CNN, said Wednesday that Putin likely thought the invasion would be a 48-hour “cakewalk” with cities across Ukraine falling quickly to his troops. The war is now in its fourth week, with the United Nations estimating that some 7,000 to 15,000 Russian troops have been killed. “I mean, that’s hubris,” Marks told anchor Pamela Brown. “That’s a misunderstanding, a strategic miscalculation that’s incredibly huge. And Putin is in the intel business and he totally blew it.

That has been totally exposed,” he explained. An “incredible lack of leadership” meant supplies couldn’t get to the front lines and Russian soldiers didn’t know what to do or why they were doing it, he said. “I mean, it’s a total collapse of the Russian military,” Marks added.

The indictments have been under seal since mid-2021 but were made public to bolster growing concerns that Russia may unleash cyberattacks against the U.S., Europe and other nations that have opposed its ongoing invasion of Ukraine. In one indictment from August 2021, Justice Department officials said three hackers from Russia’s federal security service (FSB), the Kremlin’s spy agency, worked to target and compromise the energy sector so it could “disrupt and damage such computer systems at a future time of its choosing.” The hacking took place between 2012 and 2017, and targeted “thousands of computers, at hundreds of companies and organizations, in approximately 135 countries,” officials alleged. A second indictment from June 2021 homed in on an employee of Russia’s ministry of defense and his co-conspirators, alleging Evgeny Viktorovich Gladkikh hacked a multinational energy company in 2017. Officials said the hackers installed malware that interfered with a refinery’s safety systems. Gladkikh spent six months in 2018 researching how he could deploy a similar effort at U.S. refineries. Today, @TheJusticeDept unsealed charges against four Russian government actors for their roles in separate malicious #cyber campaigns targeting the U.S. energy sector. “Russian state-sponsored hackers pose a serious and persistent threat to critical infrastructure both in the United States and around the world,” Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco said in a statement. “Although the criminal charges unsealed today reflect past activity, they make crystal clear the urgent ongoing need for American businesses to harden their defenses and remain vigilant.” The four Russians are not in U.S. custody, but a Justice Department official told The Guardian that the “benefit of revealing the results of the investigation now outweighs the likelihood of arrests in the future.” Russia does not extradite defendants to the United States, so the citizens will likely not be brought to trial. President Joe Biden has warned about the growing potential for Russian cyberattacks in recent days, saying he believed Russian President Vladimir Putin could soon turn to such tactics. “The more Putin’s back is against the wall, the greater the severity of the tactics he may employ … one of the tools he’s most likely to use, in my view, in our view, is cyberattacks,” Biden told reporters on Monday. “The magnitude of Russia’s cyber capacity is fairly consequential, and it’s coming.”",20,,,,7

Biden said in a statement Monday that his administration “can’t defend against this threat alone” and cited recommendations for private businesses and leaders in critical infrastructure to follow. But individual Americans can also do their part. “State-sponsored cyberattacks aren’t usually financially motivated; instead, they aim to be more disruptive to institutions,” said Stephanie Carruthers, a white hat hacker who is chief people hacker at IBM’s X-Force Red. “As we see cyber increasingly become a powerful tool used in warfare, consumers can do their part to avoid getting caught in the digital crossfire or becoming an attacker’s entry point into an organization’s network.” Here are some of the most important recommendations from real-life hackers and other cybersecurity experts: The Biden administration is urging companies to mandate the use of multifactor authentication on their systems, and the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency includes it among their top four recommendations for individuals right now, too. This can include turning on two-step verification for your Google accounts and Gmail, social media platforms like Facebook, your Social Security account, and banking and credit card websites. Multifactor authentication “essentially requires a second form of authentication by the consumer to protect their account in the event a password has been compromised,” Carruthers explained. Kevin Johnson, CEO of the consultancy Secure Ideas and a hacker hired by companies to test their own security vulnerabilities, said using multifactor authentication everywhere you possibly can is one of the easiest and most important things people can do to protect themselves against cyberattacks. “[Hackers] find the weakest link, and the weakest link are people,” he said, adding, “Any place that you’re not using MFA, if an attackers gains access to your account there, they can leverage that access against you further. If I get access to your email, I have access to everything.” If MFA isn’t possible, there may be other fallbacks that essentially do the same thing. “Biometric authentication forms are also a safer backup option: Using a fingerprint or Face ID is tougher for a cybercriminal to get around,” Carruthers said. Passwords are everywhere, and they are the gateway into your bank account, emails, employer or organizational information, and more. Once a cybercriminal figures out one password, it will open the door to others. “Consumers need to do a better job of updating their passwords regularly, choosing long and unique passwords for each account, and realizing that using their dog’s name and their birth year for a password combination is a poor and risky choice that can easily be guessed,” Carruthers said. Johnson warned that even when a system’s password complexity requirements seem strong, they are not that strong against hackers. Just because your credit card website requires your password to have a capital letter, lowercase letters, numbers and symbols, for example, doesn’t mean your choice is actually strong or secure. CISA recommends that you go above simply using a complex password and get a password manager, which can both generate and safely store legitimately complex passwords while you only have to remember one master password. One of CISA’s top recommendations for individual-level protection against Russian cyberattacks is to update software and apps and turn on automatic updates so they stay current. “Bad actors will exploit flaws in the system. Update the operating system on your mobile phones, tablets and laptops,” CISA recommends. “And update your applications –– especially the web browsers — on all your devices, too.” The fact that your laptop or phone is operating just fine on outdated software does not mean it is operating securely. Johnson said when he encounters people who have the mentality of “‘This is how we’ve always done it,’ ... I know that i’m going to have an easy time [hacking them].” CISA estimates that more than 90% of successful cyberattacks start with a phishing email, in which “a link or webpage looks legitimate, but it’s a trick designed by bad actors to have you reveal your passwords, Social Security number, credit card numbers or other sensitive information.” Carruthers said one telltale sign of a phishing scam is receiving odd requests from a work colleague or your company’s upper management. “CFOs and HR departments are very often impersonated by cybercriminals to invoke a certain action from an employee,” she said. The level of urgency or presence of emotional stressors is also a subtle tip-off. “Is the email, text or voicemail you received evoking a sense of urgency, panic or fear?” Carruthers said. That’s a sign. When in doubt, don’t click, and directly contact the person or organization to find out if the request is legitimate. Nick Santora, CEO of the security awareness training platform Curricula, said people fall prey to the mentality of thinking cyberattacks won’t happen to them, but phishing scams “happen every day to countless numbers of victims.” “Anyone can pretend to be someone they’re not on the other end of the phone or other side of the screen,” Santora said. “Confidence is king, and that’s why hackers are successful in this approach targeting the most vulnerable population, such as the elderly.” Just because someone says they are a trusted individual hired by a legitimate organization doesn’t mean they are. Johnson shared an example of when he was hired by a bank to test its physical security. Only one employee called him out and asked why he was present at the bank’s data center. Johnson complimented her for catching him and said that he was hired by the company to run a security test. He told her to keep his presence a secret for the sake of the test, and she did so. “She didn’t ask for any proof, she got my business card.... That’s the only verification she did,” Johnson said. ”All I did was switch the script on her, and she didn’t stop to think about it.” His example underscores why you should verify before taking someone’s credentials at face value. “Scam artists and cybercriminals will do their homework. They will study their targets, their social media profiles and do as much open-source reconnaissance to craft a phishing lure that will avoid suspicions,” Carruthers said. “If a consumer has doubt or isn’t sure, if an email, text they’ve received is legitimate, they shouldn’t engage with it.”",20,,,,4

Blinken highlighted a Russian attack on a maternity hospital in Mariupol and a United Nations estimate that the war has killed at least 2,500 Ukrainian civilians so far, and likely many more. “The U.S. will continue to track reports of war crimes and will share information we gather with allies, partners and international institutions and organizations,” the secretary added. “We are committed to pursuing accountability using every tool available, including criminal prosecution.” Earlier this month, the International Criminal Court launched an investigation into the Russian offensive after an uncommonly large number of countries referred the issue to the court’s chief prosecutor. Prosecutions could take place in U.S. courts if they have any jurisdiction over alleged war criminals or in third countries where such targets could be vulnerable, according to Beth Van Schaack, the Biden administration’s ambassador at large for global criminal justice. Van Schaak participated in a State Department press briefing after Blinken issued his statement. She noted that international law doctrine allows for high-ranking officials to be held responsible for the actions of their subordinates — raising the prospect of possible future cases against Russian President Vladimir Putin. Van Schaack declined to specify American intelligence identifying evidence of war crimes or particular incidents the U.S. is probing, but she noted that proof could include materials like intercepted signals. “Keeping the world apprised of what’s happening on the ground in Ukraine is extremely important,” she said.

David Petraeus","The reported deaths of five Russian generals in Ukraine is a sign of significant trouble for the Kremlin’s invasion, retired U.S. Gen. David Petraeus told Jake Tapper on CNN Sunday. “This is very, very uncommon. This is in the first three weeks,” said Petraeus. “These are quite senior generals.” Petraeus said four of the deaths have been confirmed. “I think the fifth we’ll hear today,” he added. Petraeus attributed the deaths to a variety of factors, including Ukrainians jamming Russian communications, skilled snipers and a Russian military structure that keeps decisions in very few hands. “The bottom line is that their command and control has broken down. Their communications have been jammed by the Ukrainians,” Petraeus said. “Their secure coms didn’t work. They had to go to a single channel that’s jammable ― and that’s exactly what the Ukrainians have been doing to that.” Without communication options, the military column gets stopped. And when an impatient general heads to the front to find out what’s going on, he’s shot and killed. “The Ukrainians have very, very good snipers and they’ve just been picking them off left and right,” Petraeus added. Retired Lt. Gen. Ben Hodges, the former commander of the U.S. Army in Europe, also said the Russians were in trouble in Ukraine. “Russian generals are running out of time, ammunition and manpower,” Hodges wrote in an assessment last week for the Center for European Policy Analysis. “That’s not based on any inside intelligence — it’s clear from open source information and my own experience.” In the latest blow to Russian military leadership, officials confirmed Sunday that navy commander Andrei Paly was killed in fighting in the Ukrainian city of Mariupol, Agence France-Presse reported. Paly, 51, was the deputy commander of Russia’s Black Sea Fleet. Check out Petraeus’ full interview in the video clip above.",7,,,,8

Russian commander Col. Gen. Sergei Beseda was in charge of the FSB’s Ukraine operation, according to the Journal, citing a U.S. official. The unidentified American official also told the newspaper that “bickering had broken out” between the FSB and the Russian Ministry of Defense, which were the key government agencies planning the invasion. Citing Russian news sources, The New York Times reported that a second FSB official was also under house arrest. Russia’s military operation has not gone nearly as well as planned. CIA Director William Burns told Congress earlier this month that Putin had planned to seize the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv within two days. Yet the city continues to fend off Russian forces nearly a month after the invasion began. As many as five Russian generals have been killed in the fighting, according to Ukraine. That’s bad news for officials surrounding Putin, observers warn. “When it comes to this guy, it’s clear that the culture of ‘someone is at fault and is going to pay’ is clearly still operative,” former CIA and National Security Council official Jeffrey Edmonds told the Journal. But the finger-pointing and rising fear and discontent in the Kremlin could also be bad news for Putin. Russian history scholar Stephen Kotkin said in a recent New Yorker interview that Putin is only getting the information that “he wants to hear. In any case, he believes that he’s superior and smarter. This is the problem of despotism,” he added. “It’s why despotism, or even just authoritarianism, is all-powerful and brittle at the same time.” Read the full Wall Street Journal story.",7,,,,22

James Whitney Hill, known to friends as Jimmy, was killed by heavy artillery attacks on unarmed civilians in the city, The New York Times reported. His identity was reportedly confirmed by an aide to the Ukrainian Interior Ministry. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said a U.S. citizen had been killed in Ukraine but did not provide a name or further details. “My brother Jimmy Hill was killed yesterday in Chernihiv, Ukraine,” Cheryl Hill Gordon wrote on Facebook on Thursday afternoon. “He was waiting in a bread line with several other people when they were gunned down by Russian military [snipers]. His body was found in the street by the local police.” The U.S. embassy in Kyiv said Wednesday that Russian forces had shot and killed 10 people standing in line for bread in Chernihiv. Another sister, Katya Hill, told MPR News her brother was out looking for food when he was killed, but said the State Department could not tell her if he was among the victims in the bread line or if he was killed in another attack. According to Hill’s Facebook page, he was a freelance lecturer and had worked at the Taras Shevchenko National University in Kyiv. Katya Hill said he was a social worker and forensic psychologist and had worked on and off in Ukraine for about 20 years. He traveled to Chernihiv in December to seek treatment for his partner Irina, a Ukrainian citizen who has multiple sclerosis, his friend told an Idaho news station earlier this month. After Russia invaded Ukraine, Hill and his companions were trapped inside a hospital with limited food, water and electricity. In a series of updates on Facebook in his final days, Hill said his partner, whom he called Ira, was in intensive care. He said they wanted to flee the city, but couldn’t determine how to do so safely. “Its a living nightmare but we are alive,” he wrote in one post last week. “Bombing throughout the day. Helpless feeling.” “We could try a break out tomorrow but Ira’s mom doesnt want to,” Hill wrote earlier this week. “Each day people are killed trying to escape. But bombs falling here at night.” He said he and his companions only had enough food for a few more days and that it was very cold in the hospital. Chernihiv, a city close to the Russian border, has been surrounded by Russian military. Civilians are increasingly dying under sustained attack from enemy forces in residential areas. The city’s mayor said last week that Chernihiv had run out of room to bury its dead. In his final post, on Tuesday, Hill said that the bombing had intensified and there was no way out.",47,,,,12

Personally, I agree,” Blinken said while giving an update on the conflict that has killed Ukrainian citizens and members of the media. “Intentionally targeting civilians is a war crime. After all the destruction in the past three weeks I find it difficult to conclude that the Russians are doing otherwise,” Blinken added. Blinken cited recent attacks by Russian troops on Ukrainian hospitals, schools, apartment buildings, a boarding school for visually impaired kids, civilians lined up for bread, and a theater where hundreds had taken shelter. “The word ‘children’ had been written in Russian in giant white letters on the pavement outside the building so that you could know from the air that there were children outside,” he said of the theater attack in the southern port city of Mariupol. Blinken also cited the deaths of Fox News cameraman Pierre Zakrzewski and filmmaker and journalist Brent Renaud, who was on assignment for Time magazine. Ukrainian journalist Oleksandra Kuvshynova, who was working as a freelancer for Fox News, was also killed in the attack that killed Zakrzewski and wounded Fox News correspondent Benjamin Hall. Blinken confirmed that a U.S. citizen is also among the recent dead, but said he had no further details. The victim has been identified by local U.S. media and family as James Whitney Hill. Hill had extensively posted on Facebook about his efforts to survive the war while caring for a sick loved one in the city of Chernihiv, in northern Ukraine. His last post was on Tuesday.

The Russian word for “children” was painted on the pavement in huge white letters on two sides of the building, according to satellite imagery from Maxars. There was no immediate information on the number of injuries or deaths. The word 'children' was painted in large Russian script on the ground outside the Mariupol Drama Theatre, Maxar satellite images collected on March 14 showed. Ukraine accused Russia of bombing the theater on Wednesday. Russia denies the attack  Ukrainian Minister of Foreign Affairs Dmytro Kuleba said the Drama Theater had been destroyed, calling it a “horrendous war crime.” “Russians could not have not known this was a civilian shelter,” Kuleba said in a tweet. While critics of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s war in Ukraine have been calling him a “war criminal” for weeks, on Wednesday U.S. President Joe Biden joined them. Another horrendous war crime in Mariupol. Massive Russian attack on the Drama Theater where hundreds of innocent civilians were hiding. The building is now fully ruined. Russians could not have not known this was a civilian shelter. Save Mariupol! Stop Russian war criminals!  “He’s a war criminal,” Biden said plainly. Russian troops have been laying siege to Mariupol for about two weeks, encircling the city and largely preventing civilians from leaving. Electricity, food, water and medicine are all running out. It’s a medieval tactic that Putin has used before with devastating consequences in Aleppo, Syria, in 2016 and in Grozny, Chechnya, in 2000. The plight of Mariupol has been chronicled for the Western world by two Associated Press journalists, who believe they are the only international members of the press still in the city. People have been melting snow for drinking water, they report, and venturing out only for essentials before returning to wherever they are sheltering from the persistent shelling. The number of casualties is unknown because it is often too dangerous to venture out to find the wounded and the dead; the official number is around 2,400, according to The New York Times. Russia claims that its forces are not targeting or killing civilians, but Russian artillery has decimated apartment buildings and hospitals, and killed people along evacuation routes. Ukrainian officials say Russian troops took 500 people ― about 100 doctors and patients and 400 people who lived in houses nearby ― hostage at one hospital in Mariupol late Tuesday. The troops allegedly rounded up neighbors and drove them to the hospital, using gunfire to prevent anyone from trying to leave. In the northern Ukrainian city of Chernihiv, Russians “shot and killed 10 people standing in line for bread,” the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv said Wednesday. The International Criminal Court at The Hague announced earlier this month that it was investigating whether war crimes were being committed by the Russians. Part of the rationale Putin has used to justify his invasion was a purported “genocide” in the eastern part of Ukraine, but the United Nations’ International Court of Justice said Wednesday that its investigation had found no evidence of such a genocide. In a largely symbolic gesture, the ICJ ordered Russia to halt its assault.",47,,,,8

General: Russia May Face Trouble In Ukraine ‘Within The Next 10 Days’,"A former U.S. Army general predicted Monday that the Russian military could soon run out of the manpower and weaponry needed to continue its invasion of Ukraine. Retired Lt. Gen. Ben Hodges, the former commander of U.S. Army forces in Europe, said recent moves by Russia to extend its campaign to western Ukraine and reports that the country had asked China for military supplies may mean the Kremlin is running out of steam. “Russia’s decision to transition to a war of attrition, where they’re smashing cities, putting civilians on the road for fear of being murdered, they need three things to do this, and they don’t have those three things,” Hodges said on MSNBC’s “Meet the Press.” “They don’t have the time, they don’t have the manpower and I don’t think they have the ammunition.” WATCH: Russia needs three things for a war of attrition that they don't have: ""the time ... the manpower and ... the ammunition,"" says @general_ben. ""Within the next 10 days Russia is going to culminate, which means they will not be able to continue the attack any further.""  Hodges’ comments were buoyed by evidence that Russia was running low on weaponry as Ukraine continued to mount a fiercer-than-expected resistance, notably around the capital of Kyiv. He said that if the West continued to support Ukrainians, it could be less than two weeks before the Russian military reached what he referred to as its culmination point. “Assuming that we, the West, not only continue but accelerate the delivery of the capabilities the Ukrainians need, I think within the next 10 days that Russia is going to culminate, which means they will not be able to continue the attack any further,” Hodges said. “So, it’s kind of a race, actually, if we give the Ukrainians enough so they can outlast Russia.” Russian forces will culminate within the next ten days if we maintain pressure on them...they have manpower problems and ammo shortages. Accelerate/expand support to UKR to destroy Russian arty, rockets, and cruise missiles. Now is the time to keep our foot on the gas. Hodges added that there was a big caveat to his prediction, a nod to Putin’s unpredictability during the invasion. “I’ve been wrong a lot,” he said. “I don’t have a crystal ball here.”",7,,,,27

NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg referenced the use of cluster bombs in Ukraine on Friday, according to Reuters. “We have seen the use of cluster bombs and we have seen reports of use of other types of weapons which would be in violation of international law,” Stoltenberg said. Cluster munitions disperse when fired, causing destruction over a wide area and posing “an immediate threat to civilians,” according to Human Rights Watch.

Blinken told CBS’ “Face the Nation” that the U.S. is in “very active discussions” with Poland to back-fill any fighter jets provided to Ukraine. “All of us together are continuing to take steps to increase the pressure on Russia through additional sanctions, all of which are very actively under discussion and will be implemented in the in the coming days, as well as taking further steps to give the Ukrainians what they need to defend themselves against the Russian aggression,” Blinken said. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Sunday that NATO members have the go-ahead to send fighter jets to Ukraine as the U.S. and allies continue their efforts to help Ukraine defend itself against Russia's invasion.  Blinken also said the U.S. may heighten economic sanctions, possibly including banning Russian oil imports. Oil prices climbed further on the suggestion. “We are now in very active discussions with our European partners about banning the import of Russian oil to our countries, while of course at the same time maintaining a steady global supply of oil,” Blinken told NBC’s “Meet The Press.” “The actions we’ve taken to date have already had a devastating impact on the Russian economy.” Sec. of State Blinken reiterates this to Chuck Todd on Meet the Press: ""We are now in very active discussions with our European partners about banning the import of Russian oil to our countries, while, of course, at the same time maintaining a steady global supply of oil.""

The defense official told reporters Monday that the Pentagon found it “noteworthy” that Putin “believes he needs to rely on foreign fighters to supplement what is a very significant commitment of combat power inside Ukraine as it is.” NEWS: Defense Official Says Russians Reportedly Recruiting Syrian Mercenaries . The official said the Kremlin had already committed nearly 100% of the 150,000 troops amassed along the Ukrainian border since the invasion began last month. “They continue to be frustrated by a stiff Ukrainian resistance, as well as their own internal challenges,” the defense official said Monday. Pentagon spokesperson John Kirby told The New York Times this week that U.S. analysts don’t have any details about the number of Syrians Russia has recruited or whether they may already be in Ukraine. Britain’s Ministry of Defense said Sunday that Russian forces likely made “minimal ground advances” over the weekend and that it was highly unlikely the Kremlin had achieved its military objectives to date. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy rallied his country in an address from his office in Kyiv on Monday night, saying the country would rebuild itself after it repelled the invading forces. “There will be no trace of the enemy,” he said. “We will make our cities destroyed by the invader better than any city in Russia.”",7,,,,3

Since Russia’s unprovoked war on its western neighbor began last week, Zelenskyy has been conducting business from a handful of bunkers throughout the nation’s capital, having declined an offer from the U.S. to evacuate him. That’s left him vulnerable to attempts on his life by teams of Kremlin-backed assassins. Ukrainian National Security and Defense Council Secretary Oleksiy Danilov told a Ukrainian television network that anti-war elements in Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB) have been essential in helping foil some of the plots. In a defiant speech last week, Zelenskyy acknowledged that he is “target No. 1” in an effort to “damage Ukraine politically by destroying the head of state.” “But we are not afraid, we are not afraid of anything,” he said. “We are not afraid to defend our country. We are not afraid of Russia.” U.S. officials warned last month that Russian forces have compiled a hit list of Ukrainian citizens to be killed or sent to detention camps. The Kremlin has reportedly dispatched two separate groups of mercenaries to Kyiv in an attempt to fulfill that directive. One is being orchestrated by the Wagner Group, a private military contractor run by Vladimir Putin ally Yevgeny Prigozhin, aka “Putin’s Chef.” The other is a group of elite Chechen fighters controlled by Chechen Republic leader Ramzan Akhmadovich Kadyrov. Danilov said on Tuesday that an assassination attempt by the Chechens over the weekend failed, and the group responsible for the attempt had been “destroyed.” Among those killed by Ukrainian forces was Chechen-Russian Gen. Magomed Tushayev, who has been accused of torturing and killing LGBTQ+ people in Chechnya. “As we’ve seen in the past, we expect Russia will try to force cooperation through intimidation and repression,” a U.S. official speaking on condition of anonymity told Foreign Policy. “These acts, which in past Russian operations have included targeted killings, kidnappings/forced disappearances, detentions, and the use of torture, would likely target those who oppose Russian actions, including Russian and Belarusian dissidents in exile in Ukraine, journalists and anti-corruption activists, and vulnerable populations such as religious and ethnic minorities and LGBTQI+ persons.”",20,,,,8

Zelenskyy said a large number of Russians are believed to have died in the conflict so far, but he alleged that no one is keeping track. Russian President Vladimir Putin amassed around 150,000 troops to support the conflict, according to the Pentagon. Most have been deployed. “No one is counting them. No one cares how many die in the shellings,” Zelenskyy said. “They knew in advance they were not going to show to their families, to their mothers, what happened to their children, that they died here,” he went on. “They came here to kill us, and we are defending our freedom and our homes, and that’s why they’re dying. We don’t want to kill them.” ""[Russia] brought crematoriums with them... we don't want to kill them""Ukrainian President Zelensky tells a press conference ""the end of the world has arrived""  In the eight days since the invasion began, people on social media have circulated graphic photos and videos of dead Russian soldiers apparently abandoned on the sides of roads. The Telegraph previously reported that mobile crematoriums were expected to be used on the battlefield, citing U.K. Defense Secretary Ben Wallace. Putin pledged Thursday to grant the families of fallen soldiers 5 million rubles ― around $50,000 ― in what The New York Times said was the first time Putin publicly acknowledged that Russians have died in the war. The Russian leader also sought to downplay widespread reports that the Ukrainians have put up a much stronger defense than he’d anticipated, claiming that the “special military operation in Ukraine” is “going strictly according to the schedule just as it has been planned.” The Russian Defense Ministry on Wednesday announced that nearly 500 of its soldiers have been killed and another 1,600 injured, although Western estimates are significantly higher. Ukraine says its fighters have killed more than 5,000 Russian troops. An American official told The New York Times the figure is more like 2,000. Russia reportedly took control of the Ukrainian port city Kherson this week ― the first major city to be taken over. But according to the Pentagon, and scattered reports, the Russian military is facing a serious morale problem made worse by food shortages. Some Russian troops are sabotaging their own military vehicles and laying down arms, according to the Pentagon, in order to avoid fighting a war that Russian authorities have baselessly described as a mission to liberate oppressed Ukrainians.",7,,,,8

We are defending our home, we do not have any other option. We will not get tired, we will not stop, we will not surrender, we will continue defending our home.” Vacuum bombs, also known as thermobaric weapons, suck in oxygen to create high-temperature and high-pressure explosions that can cause widespread destruction and death. There hasn’t been independent confirmation that Russia has used vacuum bombs in Ukraine. On Saturday, CNN reporters near the Ukraine-Russia border said they identified a Russian thermobaric rocket launcher. Markarova said Russia is targeting orphanages and schools in Ukrainian cities. “We believe Russia, which is now acting like Nazi Germany during the World War II, essentially killing innocent civilians,” Markarova said. “It’s horrible, they have to pay the price, they have to be isolated.” She said Ukraine is working with the Biden administration and Congress to secure more weapons. Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) who was among the senators meeting with Markarova behind closed doors Monday, told Politico the current crisis calls for unity. “This is the most dangerous moment since the Cuban missile crisis,” Murphy said. White House press secretary Jen Psaki said the administration has not confirmed reports of Russia using thermobaric weapons. “If that were true, it would potentially be a war crime,” Psaki said. World leaders have expressed alarm over Russia’s tactics during the invasion. “It is clear that Vladimir Putin is prepared to use barbaric and indiscriminate tactics against innocent civilians to bomb tower blocks, to send missiles into tower blocks, to kill children, as we’re seeing in increasing numbers,” U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said Tuesday from Warsaw.

The president said the sanctions would hit two major Russian banks and make it harder for Moscow to raise money by selling its sovereign debt. Meanwhile, the U.S. will send U.S. soldiers from elsewhere in Europe to Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania — countries that were formerly part of the Soviet Union but have since become democracies and U.S. allies as part of the NATO military alliance. “We have no intention of fighting Russia,” Biden said. “We want to send an unmistakable message, though, that the United States and our allies will defend every inch of NATO territory.” The U.S. views Putin’s move to bolster Russian-backed breakaway regions in Ukraine as an invasion. Washington and its friends plan to soon unveil further steps to punish Russia and deter further escalation. “As Russia contemplates its next move, we have our next move prepared as well,” Biden said, adding that he believes Putin plans to escalate his incursion. “The United States will continue to provide defensive assistance to Ukraine.” Washington is also placing sanctions on influential Russians close to Putin and their family members, the president added. The group includes Russian spy chief Alexander Bortnikov, Putin aide Sergei Kiriyenko and three well-connected businessmen. Biden’s remarks came after Putin said the separatists should control a much larger portion of Ukraine than they already do, possibly signaling that Russian troops will fight the Western-backed Ukrainian army to capture new territory and set off a longer, bloodier conflict. Russia has also begun evacuating its diplomatic facilities in Ukraine. The U.S. is not obligated to defend Ukraine, but American officials and national security experts say a Russian-led upheaval of the status quo in Europe would endanger NATO states and would drive long-term instability. As Putin has amassed over 100,000 troops along Ukraine’s borders in recent months, NATO members have sent military support to Ukraine and reinforced their own forces in Russia’s neighborhood. Russia says NATO must withdraw from countries on its periphery — despite their independence — and promise to never accept Ukraine as a member. Earlier in the day, NATO member Germany said it would halt a pipeline project that would have let Russia earn millions of dollars by pumping gas across Europe. Berlin’s move vindicated the Biden administration’s strategy of warm, close cooperation with U.S. allies — undercutting Republicans’ claims that the president must intensely pressure European nations like Germany. German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said Tuesday that her country wants to remain united with its friends and show “a stop sign” to Russia. In a call with reporters on Tuesday afternoon, a senior Biden administration official called the pipeline, known as Nord Stream 2, “a cash cow” for Putin and said the pause represented “a major turning point in the world’s energy independence from Russia.” The U.S. will continue “to reduce Europe’s addiction to Russian gas,” the official added, and is ready to impose broader, more painful measures like targeting Sberbank, Russia’s largest financial bank, and cutting Moscow off from the SWIFT financial system. Western governments still hope that diplomacy can tamp down tensions on the continent, Biden said. The administration official noted that simply placing the maximum of sanctions on Russia is not America’s goal: “Sanctions are meant to deter and prevent. We want to prevent a large-scale of invasion of Ukraine,” the official said. And the president notably did not mention the possibility that he will hold a summit with Putin, though Secretary of State Antony Blinken did later cancel a planned meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. For now, “we still believe Russia is poised to go much further,” Biden said.",4,,,,26

A White House national security adviser, Jonathan Finer, told CNN that “the beginning” of Russia’s “latest invasion” was underway and that Biden would be rolling out new sanctions against Russia “in a matter of hours.” ""An invasion is an invasion and that is what is under way,"" says WH Principal Deputy National Security Adviser Jon Finer as Putin orders troops into Eastern Ukraine.  Russian President Vladimir Putin said Monday that he sees parts of eastern Ukraine that are controlled by separatist militias as independent countries and wants to redraw European borders for the first time in decades ― a violation of international law. The Kremlin previously published decrees ordering Russia’s defense ministry to deploy what it called “peacekeeping” forces in Ukraine’s Donetsk and Luhansk regions, the two Russia-backed separatist territories. At the time, it wasn’t immediately clear whether or when Russian troops would enter Ukraine and choose to fight the Western-backed Ukrainian military. The invasion comes after an increasingly tense crisis between Russia and Ukraine, which has been trying to escape Russia’s grip by moving closer toward becoming a democracy and aligning itself with the West. Russia has been building up its military along its 1,200-mile border with Ukraine since 2014, but recently accelerated its moves to try and force the U.S. and its allies to promise to keep the smaller nation out of the NATO military alliance. Russia’s buildup of more than 150,000 troops along the Ukrainian border allows for the international superpower to launch a combined-arms assault from multiple directions if it chooses to do so. Putin’s support of the Donetsk- and Luhansk-based separatists ― which he first revealed to his French and German counterparts ― threw away a yearslong diplomatic effort by the two countries to end fighting between Ukraine and the Russian-backed separatists. The Biden administration and its allied countries have warned that a massive war could break out should Russia invade the Ukrainian regions, causing widespread instability and violence in Europe. The White House has repeatedly said that U.S. troops will not fight Russians on behalf of Ukraine, but has sent thousands of American soldiers to European ally countries that have their own safety concerns related to Russia’s actions. The U.S. has also sent Ukraine military aid, and has promised to impose severe sanctions on Russia in response to further action. In response to Putin’s announcement recognizing two eastern Ukrainian regions as independent countries, the White House said that Biden would issue an executive order banning new investment, trade and financing by Americans “to, from, or in the so-called DNR and LNR regions of Ukraine.” “This E.O. will also provide authority to impose sanctions on any person determined to operate in those areas of Ukraine,” White House press secretary Jen Psaki said on Monday. “To be clear: these measures are separate from and would be in addition to the swift and severe economic measures we have been preparing in coordination with Allies and partners should Russia further invade Ukraine.” Germany on Tuesday said it would pause a pipeline that would have dramatically increased its imports of Russian gas. The U.S. and the United Kingdom have also been arming Ukraine, as have the Baltic states. Biden, French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz had been working to negotiate with Putin to de-escalate the border crisis, suggesting they do not see Ukraine as a potential NATO member and offering to recognize Russia’s stature and interests. “We believe President Putin has made the decision, but until the tanks are actually rolling, and the planes are flying, we will use every opportunity and every minute we have to see if diplomacy can still dissuade President Putin from carrying this forward,” U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Sunday on CNN. Those efforts appear to have failed. In mid-February, Putin claimed that Russia had begun a partial pullback in its military presence near the Ukraine border. However, U.S. officials denied that claim and instead accused Russia of increasing the number of troops at the border by 7,000. Ahead of the invasion, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy asked to meet with Putin in hopes of reaching a “peaceful settlement.” To try to help prevent escalation into an attack on Ukraine, Biden held a virtual summit with Putin on Dec. 7. Then, from Jan. 10 to Jan. 12, three discussions took place: one between the U.S. and Russia, one between NATO countries and Russia, and one among members of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). None ended with a solution. On Jan. 21, Blinken tried to renew the efforts by meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov in Geneva, Switzerland. That meeting also resulted in an impasse. During talks, Russia gave a series of demands in order to agree to a more peaceful approach. Some of the demands are automatically off the table with U.S. and NATO allies, such as Moscow wanting guarantees NATO would not expand eastward, including to Ukraine, and a rolling back of military deployment to some former Soviet states. The demands are “a Russian attempt, not only to secure [Putin’s] interest in Ukraine, but essentially re-litigate the security architecture of Europe,” Michael Kofman, the Russia studies research director at analysis organization CNACNA, told Vox. NATO allies released a statement during the 2008 summit in Bucharest saying they look forward to eventually welcoming Ukraine and Georgia as members. This heightened concerns for Russia, which already opposed the alliance’s decision to admit 14 new members after the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union. While the alliance is currently divided on admitting Ukraine and Georgia, it still insists on keeping its door open to new members. Nations can join only if all existing members agree to allow them in. Because NATO is considered a defensive military alliance, Russia views Ukraine joining the alliance as a security issue, considering the vast border it shares with the country.",4,,,,26

The official said that Russian leader Vladimir Putin’s decision to offer military protection to pro-Russian separatists would get a further response Tuesday, beyond the sanctions the White House announced Monday to punish anyone doing business with the two enclaves. “We will take further action tomorrow to hold Russia accountable,” the official said. He would not specify further about what the action would be. Russia has for years denied that it had forces in eastern Ukraine, but now appears to be doing so openly, the official said. “There have been Russian forces in these areas throughout,” the official said, adding the United States would be monitoring events in the coming hours to see how far Putin goes. “We will observe and assess what actions Russia actually takes and respond.” In a lengthy speech on Monday, Putin announced his decision to recognize Donetsk and Luhansk as independent states ― an action the Biden administration considers an escalation of the Russian leader’s moves to surround Ukraine by some 190,000 forces in recent weeks. “This was a speech to the Russian people to justify war,” the official said. “This is Potemkin politics, President Putin accelerating the conflict that he created.” In 2014, Putin also invaded and annexed Crimea from its neighbor, which gained independence during the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991.",4,,,,15

They will continue to support the Ukrainian people and the Ukrainian government, coordinating on diplomatic efforts.” Blinken went on to say the decision did not undermine the U.S.’s position on Ukrainian sovereignty, which remained “unwavering” amid the threat of a Russian incursion. “The fact that we are taking prudent precautions for the sake of the safety of U.S. government personnel and U.S. citizens, as we do regularly worldwide, in no way undermines our support for, or our commitment to, Ukraine,” he said. “Our commitment to Ukraine transcends any one location.” The U.S. temporarily moved its Ukraine embassy from Kyiv to Lviv last week, citing the “dramatic acceleration in the buildup of Russian forces.” Many non-essential embassy staff had already been ordered to leave the country, but key diplomats have remained. The State Department has urged American citizens to leave the country, and Blinken stressed Monday that any military operations could hamstring commercial air travel and threaten the safety of anyone regardless of nationality. Those threats only grew Monday after Putin ordered Russia’s Defense Ministry to sent troops to two separatist territories in Ukraine, escalating the conflict while saying the military movements were operating under “peacekeeper functions.” The move prompted an emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council, and the Biden administration said it would impose sanctions on the breakaway regions, but not on Russia for now. The U.S. has warned a Russian invasion of Ukraine could happen at any moment, although world leaders have pushed for last-minute diplomatic solutions.",4,,,,26

Putin announced his position in a televised address in which he questioned whether Ukraine and other nations that emerged from the Soviet Union should be independent and accused Western governments of threatening Russia. He later ordered Russian troops to the Ukrainian regions. The Russian leader’s move dramatically escalates the security crisis in Eastern Europe, where he has posted 150,000 troops in recent weeks and the U.S. has warned that a devastating all-out war could break out. Putin first revealed his decision in a call to his French and German counterparts on Monday evening ― scuttling a yearslong diplomatic process by their two countries to end fighting between Ukraine and Russian-backed separatists. “We are not afraid of anyone,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy told the nation after Russia recognized the separatist regions’ independence. President Joe Biden has repeatedly said American troops will not fight Russians on behalf of Ukraine. But he has sent the Ukrainians military support and posted thousands of U.S. soldiers in European ally countries that worry Moscow will prompt regional chaos or threaten them. Biden met with his national security team, including the secretaries of state and defense, as Putin was speaking, according to a White House statement. The president also spoke with Zelenskyy. Officials in the U.S. and its allied countries say allowing Russia to force changes in other countries against their will risks instability and widespread violence. They have promised to slap aggressive sanctions on Putin for a further incursion into Ukraine. From Moscow’s point of view, the Ukrainian government in Kyiv has grown alarmingly close to the West since Ukrainian demonstrators toppled a Putin-linked ruler in 2014. In his speech, Putin claimed that Western officials now run the country and their Ukrainian partners are mismanaging post-Soviet institutions down to the postal service and trying to quash their people’s historic ties to Russia. Russia has sought to retain influence over neighboring countries like Ukraine and challenged their bids to explore other partnerships such as the NATO military alliance. As Putin has built up his deployment along Ukraine’s borders, he has urged Western leaders to promise to never let the country join NATO and issued other demands such as a NATO withdrawal from the Baltic countries of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia — democratic treaty allies of the U.S. Biden, French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz have tried to negotiate with their Russian counterpart by hinting that they do not see Ukraine as a candidate for NATO membership and offering to recognize Russia’s stature and interests. On Sunday, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said in an emailed statement that Biden was willing to hold a high-profile summit with Putin “if an invasion hasn’t happened.” “We are always ready for diplomacy,” Psaki said. “We are also ready to impose swift and severe consequences should Russia instead choose war. And currently, Russia appears to be continuing preparations for a full-scale assault on Ukraine very soon.” Josep Borrell, the foreign policy chief for the European Union, said Monday that Russia would face EU sanctions over recognizing the Ukrainian rebels’ claim to sovereignty. Analysts are now watching how far Russia will go to support the independence of the Ukrainian separatists: whether Putin tells Russian troops to fight the Western-backed Ukrainian military and whether the conflict expands beyond the borders of the breakaway Ukrainian regions, which are collectively known as the Donbas. “The best-case scenario ― from a human life standpoint ― is that it all ends at the current line of control: if Russian troops go in and Ukrainian troops fortify but don’t try to push the [line] forward,” Sam Greene, a professor at King’s College London, tweeted on Monday. Some of his colleagues foresee a more dreary result. To Michael Kofman of the CNA think tank, the size of the Russian deployment suggests Putin has greenlit an operation that extends beyond the Donbas “to impose regime change” in Ukraine. For the Biden administration and its partners, the coming days will involve complex diplomacy and likely pressure on Moscow ― though officials and experts have struggled to craft an effective strategy given Putin’s focus on the matter and frequently shifting narrative of the crisis. “It’s hard to listen to this speech and believe that any of the partial concessions that have been suggested - withdrawing the possibility of NATO membership from Ukraine in particular - would have made any difference,” national security commentator Cheryl Rofer tweeted amid the Russian leader’s remarks.",4,,,,18

The European Union and its partners “will react with unity, firmness and with determination in solidarity with Ukraine,” European Commission Chief Ursula von der Leyen tweeted, accusing Moscow of derailing negotiations between Ukraine’s government in Kiev and pro-Russian separatists in the east of the country. Putin said Monday that the separatist-controlled regions should now be treated as independent of Ukraine. He is widely expected to send Russian forces into the area ― known as the Donbas ― in the coming days and has amassed tens of thousands troops near other parts of Ukraine. In a statement, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said the Biden administration will bar Americans from supporting the separatists and sanction people who do. She noted that the U.S. is separately considering major sanctions on Russia if it ramps up its interference in Ukraine, where it has been supporting the insurgency since 2014. A White House official later told reporters the administration would announce additional actions on Tuesday. British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said her nation would also unveil new sanctions that day. National security experts worry that intense fighting will soon break out, and Western intelligence suggests Putin will claim that the Ukrainians have initiated it. Alar Karis, the president of Estonia, tweeted, “Moscow is not serious about diplomacy but is looking for casus belli,” referring to a justification for war. “Moscow continues to fuel the conflict in eastern Ukraine by providing financial and military support to the separatists. It is also trying to stage a pretext to invade Ukraine once again,” NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said Monday. The Donbas conflict has already killed more than 13,000 people. Ukraine is not a U.S. treaty ally, and neither American nor European forces are expected to engage in any fighting with Russians or their partners. But Kiev has received significant Western military support, and President Joe Biden has deployed U.S. forces to neighboring allied countries like Poland and Romania to signal unity against Putin’s bid for greater regional influence. Russia has urged Washington to withdraw military support from those states ― despite their independent status and longstanding membership in the NATO alliance. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy spoke with Biden on Monday and tweeted that he is gathering his top national security aides and reaching out to other global leaders, including British Prime Minister Boris Johnson.

Two of the weapons on display Saturday were designed to be able to slip past United States missile defenses, according to The New York Times. Russia’s Defense Ministry claimed the maneuvers, following Russia’s military buildup on its border with Ukraine, had been planned for some time.

He also warned that should an invasion take place, there would be economic consequences in the United States, including higher gas prices. “I will not pretend this will not be painless,” he said, adding that he would try to alleviate such pain as best he could. Nevertheless, he said that in the event Russia invades, a response would be necessary. “If we do not stand for freedom where it is at risk today, we’ll surely pay a steeper price tomorrow.” Biden also at one point spoke directly to Russian citizens. “We’re not targeting the people of Russia,” he said. “We do not seek to destabilize Russia. To the citizens of Russia, you are not our enemy. And I do not believe you want a bloody, destructive war against Ukraine, a country and a people with whom you share such deep ties of family, history and culture.” Hours earlier, Russian President Vladimir Putin, following a meeting with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, had indicated that he was ready for talks regarding Ukraine and military transparency. Prior to that, a Russian defense official had said some Russian troops would be leaving the area. Biden has spent much of his time in recent weeks working to dissuade Putin from further aggressive action toward Ukraine, and urging allies in Western Europe to present a common front. Last week, with Scholz at his side in the White House, he declared that a lucrative natural gas pipeline from Russia to Germany would never become operational if Putin moved further into Ukraine. “There will no longer be a Nord Stream 2,” Biden said. “We will bring an end to it.” Since then, he has again spoken to Putin, as well as to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, from Camp David. Putin has amassed more than 100,000 troops along Ukraine’s border in recent months, raising fears of another invasion. In 2014, he invaded and annexed Crimea from Ukraine, which gained independence during the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991. He later moved into the eastern part of the country as well. In order to pressure Putin, Biden’s administration has relied on the strategy of releasing intelligence assessments about Russia’s preparations and its likely intentions. Last month, for example, the administration made public indications that Russia intended to release a video depicting a fake Ukrainian attack on its forces ― including actors playing corpses ― to justify an incursion.",4,,,,15

The U.S. recently announced plans to evacuate most of its diplomatic staff from Kyiv and ordered 3,000 troops to Poland on top of the 1,700 who are on their way there in demonstration of American commitment to worried NATO allies. At a press conference, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that “the best friend for enemies is panic in our country. And all this information helps only to create panic. It doesn’t help us.” When asked whether the U.S. is dangerously sparking panic in Ukraine, Sullivan said the White House is trying to “be transparent to American citizens that they should leave Ukraine immediately, because there will not be a military evacuation in the event of an invasion.” “Only one country has amassed more than 100,000 troops on the border of Ukraine. It’s not the United States. It’s Russia. That is the source of the alarm,” Sullivan said. “And we are trying to tell Ukrainians to prepare and be ready for this as well, as well as coordinate with our NATO allies and partners, so that we are able to defend NATO territory and deter any further Russian aggression should they move on Ukraine.” “But fundamentally, our view is that we’re not going to give Russia the opportunity to conduct a surprise here, to spring something on Ukraine or the world,” he continued. “We are going to make sure that we are laying out for the world what we see as transparently and plainly as we possibly can, and share that information as widely as we can. That’s what we have done. That’s what we will continue to do.” Sullivan recently also warned that U.S. intelligence shows that Russia could invade Ukraine within days, and before the Winter Olympics in Beijing end on Feb. 20. The national security adviser told reporters on Friday that intelligence shows military action could start with missile and air attacks, followed by a ground offensive. Russia has continued to deny that it plans to invade, despite its continued buildup of firepower on three sides of Ukraine. National Security adviser Jake Sullivan tells @JakeTapper that Russian forces are in a place where an invasion could take place before the end of the Beijing Winter Olympics.“A major military action could begin by Russia in Ukraine any day now,” he says. #CNNSOTU  “The hysteria of the White House is more indicative than ever,” said Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova, according to The Associated Press. “The Anglo-Saxons need a war. At any cost. Provocations, misinformation and threats are a favorite method of solving their own problems.” The Defense Department has publicly warned that Russian operatives were planning a false-flag operation, a plan in which the country would stage a fake attack on itself to have an excuse to intervene in Ukraine. Earlier this month, intelligence officials alleged there is a Russian plot to fabricate a graphic video ― allegedly staged with explosions and corpses ― as pretext for an attack on Ukraine. The claim received scrutiny from some reporters who called out the White House for not providing evidence for such a strong allegation. “First, we’re not putting forward this intelligence to start a war, which has happened in the past, Jake. We are putting forward this intelligence to stop a war. And I think that fundamentally gives it, at the outset, a different level of credibility,” Sullivan said Sunday, adding that a false-flag operation is “consistent with the Russian playbook.” Russia indeed has a history of using false-flag operations, one example being in 1968 when the Kremlin used its intelligence service to create false-flag incidents to justify Soviet military intervention in Czechoslovakia. “And then, third, if you look at Russian media, they are laying the groundwork for a potential pretext by raising the possibility of attacks by Ukrainian forces on either Russians themselves or Russia’s proxy forces in the Donbass,” he continued. “And then, finally, what we have said, stood at the podium and shared with our allies that we have information that we have gathered through intelligence that indicates that there is active planning for this. And it’s not just the United States saying it. We have our NATO allies stepping out and saying it as well, because they have been able to review that intelligence, assess its credibility and reach the same conclusion we have reached. So, I do think the world should be prepared for Russia staging a pretext and then launching a potential military action,” he said. On Saturday, President Joe Biden held an hourlong call with Vladimir Putin in which the White House said he told the Russian president that invading Ukraine would cause “widespread human suffering” and that the West was committed to diplomacy to end the crisis but “equally prepared for other scenarios.” “There was no fundamental change in the dynamic that has been unfolding now for several weeks, but we believe that we have put ideas on the table that would be in our and our allies’ interest to pursue, that would enhance European security, and that would also address some of Russia’s stated concerns, just as we have been clear that we are committed to upholding Ukraine’s sovereignty, territorial integrity and the rights of states to choose their own security arrangements,” said a senior administration official who briefed reporters about the call. “But it remains unclear whether Russia is interested in pursuing its goals diplomatically as opposed to through the use of force,” the official said. Russia has been in aggressive conflict with Ukraine since 2014, when the latter nation’s Kremlin-friendly leader was ousted by a popular uprising that has demanded a democracy more aligned with the West. Moscow responded by annexing the Crimean Peninsula and backing a separatist insurgency in eastern Ukraine, where fighting has killed over 14,000 people. France and Germany helped broker a 2015 peace deal that helped halt large-scale battles. However, regular clashes have continued with efforts to reach a political settlement having stalled. The current tensions with Russia come as NATO countries deliberate whether to allow Ukraine to enter the alliance ― a move Russia sees as a major security threat due to its shared borders with Ukraine.",4,,,,26

In 2014, he invaded and annexed Crimea from its neighbor, which gained independence during the break-up of the Soviet Union in 1991. Biden said that Putin still has the option of ending the crisis through diplomatic means, but that he cannot predict what Putin will do. “I don’t know that he knows what he’s going to do,” Biden said, adding that Putin and Russia will suffer if he goes ahead and invades. “We will impose the most severe sanctions that have ever been imposed.” Scholz, who in December took over from longtime Chancellor Angela Merkel, agreed that a new invasion would be severely punished. “There will be a high price for Russia,” he said. “Even Russia has understood the message now.” Scholz, though, did not specifically repeat Biden’s language about Nord Stream 2, despite attempts from reporters to have him clarify his position. He did say that Germany and the United States are in full agreement on the sanctions. “We will be united,” he said. “We are absolutely together.” The Biden administration has already adopted the strategy of releasing intelligence assessments about Russian preparations in order to pressure Putin not to invade. Last week, it made public indications that Russia intended to fake an attack on its forces by Ukraine — including actors playing corpses — to justify an incursion. White House press secretary Jen Psaki at Monday’s daily press briefing said Russia had a history of using such “lies” as a prelude to its aggressive behavior. “We have seen where they have used these tactics in the past,” she said. The natural gas pipeline — not yet operational — had become a sticking point in the discussions. Germany had resisted including it in the package of sanctions threatened against Russia should it invade, but in recent days has signaled that it would support scuttling the project entirely in the event of an invasion. Such a move would significantly damage Russia’s already hurting economy. “Russia needs to be able to sell that gas,” Biden said. Scholz, when asked how Germany would replace Russia’s gas, said his country has been aggressively moving away from fossil fuels to fight climate change, and this would hasten the work to switch to wind, solar and hydrogen. “We are focusing on renewable energies,” he said. “We will make sure that this is the profitable future.”",4,,,,15

Konstantin Kilimnik, a “known Russian Intelligence Services agent,” was one of 16 individuals and 16 entities sanctioned Thursday by the Biden administration for carrying out “Russian government-directed attempts to influence the 2020 U.S. presidential election,” according to a White House fact sheet. During the 2016 presidential election, Kilimnik also provided the Russian Intelligence Services with “sensitive information on polling and campaign strategy,” noted the Treasury Department statement. To distract attention from the true culprit, he promoted the false narrative that Ukraine — not Russia — had meddled in the election, according to officials. The new economic sanctions are also aimed at punishing Moscow for the massive SolarWinds cyberattack on U.S. government agencies and major companies, and its ongoing occupation and “severe human rights abuses” in Crimea. But the statement on the sanctions was the first time officials have drawn a line directly from the Trump campaign to Russian intelligence. “So much for the ‘Russian hoax’ hoax,” noted a headline in The Washington Post, referring to former President Donald Trump’s repeated claim that any such connection was fake. The FBI is currently offering a reward of up to $250,000 for information leading to the arrest of Kilimnik. He’s believed to be in Russia. Kilimnik, whose employment as a Russian and Ukrainian political consultant served as cover, worked for years with Manafort, a longtime U.S. Republican political operative and consultant who was Trump’s onetime 2016 campaign manager. Kilimnik was variously described as a fixer, office manager and translator in his work with Manafort. Former special counsel Robert Mueller, who investigated Russian interference in the 2016 election, accused Manafort of lying about providing election data to Kilimnik to feed to Russian intelligence. Trump denied knowing of any such arrangement. Kilimnik was indicted in 2017 with Manafort on U.S. federal charges of obstruction of justice and conspiracy to obstruct justice regarding lobbying work. That work was related to Kilimnik and Manafort’s efforts to restore former Ukraine President Viktor Yanukovych, who was backed by the Kremlin, to power. Manafort was later convicted of eight felonies, including bank and tax fraud, and was sentenced to more than seven years in prison. Trump pardoned him in December, declaring him an innocent victim of “perhaps the greatest witch hunt in American history.” The U.S. statement on sanctions said the Russia Foreign Intelligence Department was responsible for the SolarWinds cyberattack, which managed to access some of Microsoft’s source code. Besides the 32 entities and individuals sanctioned for links to Kremlin-directed meddling in the 2020 election, six Russian tech companies are also being sanctioned for supporting the Russian Intelligence Services’ cyber program. Another eight individuals and entities are being sanctioned for repression in the Crimea. As part of the U.S. action, 10 Russian diplomats in Washington will be expelled and will have 30 days to leave, sources told CNN. The Biden administration is also barring American financial institutions from participating in the primary market for bonds issued by Russia’s central bank and other leading financial institutions.",20,,,,16

There is concern within the U.S. intelligence community that the hackers who targeted Treasury and the Commerce Department’s National Telecommunications and Information Administration used a similar tool to break into other government agencies, according to four people briefed on the matter. The people did not say which other agencies. Three of the people familiar with the investigation said Russia is currently believed to be behind the attack. Two of the people said that the breaches are connected to a broad campaign that also involved the recently disclosed hack on FireEye, a major U.S. cybersecurity company with government and commercial contracts. “The United States government is aware of these reports and we are taking all necessary steps to identify and remedy any possible issues related to this situation,” said National Security Council spokesman John Ullyot. The hack is so serious it led to a National Security Council meeting at the White House on Saturday, said one of the people familiar with the matter. The Commerce Department confirmed there was a breach at one of its agencies in a statement. “We have asked the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency and the FBI to investigate, and we cannot comment further at this time.” The breach presents a major challenge to the incoming administration of President-elect Joe Biden as officials investigate what information was stolen and try to ascertain what it will be used for. It is not uncommon for large scale cyber investigations to take months or years to complete. “This is a much bigger story than one single agency,” said one of the people familiar with the matter. “This is a huge cyber espionage campaign targeting the U.S. government and its interests.” Hackers broke into the NTIA’s office software, Microsoft’s Office 365. Staff emails at the agency were monitored by the hackers for months, sources said. A Microsoft spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Neither did a spokesman for the Treasury Department. The hackers are “highly sophisticated” and have been able to trick the Microsoft platform’s authentication controls, according to a person familiar with the incident, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not allowed to speak to the press. “This is a nation state,” said a different person briefed on the matter. The full scope of the breach is unclear. The investigation is still its early stages and involves a range of federal agencies, including the FBI, according to three of the people familiar with the matter. A spokesperson for the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency said they have been “working closely with our agency partners regarding recently discovered activity on government networks. CISA is providing technical assistance to affected entities as they work to identify and mitigate any potential compromises.” The FBI and U.S. National Security Agency did not immediately respond to a request for comment. There is some indication that the email compromise at NTIA dates back to this summer, although it was only recently discovered, according to a senior U.S. official.

Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe said at a last-minute press conference on Wednesday that both Iran and Russia “had taken specific actions to influence public opinion relating to our elections.” Ratcliffe, a controversial former Republican member of Congress, claimed that Iran sent emails to “damage” President Donald Trump but didn’t specify that Russia was targeting Vice President Joe Biden. Ratcliffe did say that Russia had obtained voter information, just as it had in 2016. “We will not tolerate foreign interference in our elections,” Ratcliffe said. The press conference came after The Washington Post reported that the U.S. government believed Iran was behind threatening emails sent to Democratic voters that purported to be from the Proud Boys, a far-right, neo-fascist organization that has been supportive of Trump. FBI Director Christopher Wray didn’t specify which candidates were being targeted by which countries, but he encouraged Americans to seek information from reliable sources and be “thoughtful” consumers of online information. “You should be confident that your vote counts.

I know that from the briefers. Because he’ll explode and the whole thing will get derailed, because he has this weird affinity for [Russian President Vladimir] Putin.” Asked why Putin is such a touchy subject, Polymeropoulos said that Trump “wants Putin to like him.” “He doesn’t want to be embarrassed in front of Putin, that’s part of the dilemma,” he said. “Just look at how he behaves with the Queen. That’s how he behaves with everyone who has any glamour and cachet,” he continued, adding, “Putin has everything he doesn’t have.” The former official’s comments bolster a September report from Politico alleging that CIA Director Gina Haspel has been preventing intelligence about Russia from reaching the president’s ears to appease him. The former Soviet republic ran disinformation campaigns to tilt the 2016 U.S. presidential election in Trump’s favor, and Trump has been repeatedly criticized throughout his presidency for his dealings with Putin, which have included at least five secret meetings. Most recently, Trump allies have been accused of playing into the Russians’ hands by accepting and making political hay out of disinformation about Democratic presidential contender Joe Biden and his family. Ioffe’s in-depth reporting describes the lingering effects of a mysterious attack Polymeropoulos, a former CIA operative, withstood while staying at a Moscow hotel in December 2017. He believes he was hit with the same unknown device that has been aimed at U.S. diplomats in Cuba and China and is believed to be wielded by Russians. Some experts believe the device uses microwaves to target specific individuals or rooms, causing sudden and overwhelming nausea and dizziness. Some victims say the attacks were accompanied by either a high or low buzzing or grinding noise. According to Ioffe, the scope of the attacks is actually much larger than previously known to the public ― CIA agents all over the globe have suffered its effects, which include lasting brain damage ― and, under the Trump administration, the United States is not doing much to stop them. Polymeropoulos alleges that Russia knows Trump “is at war with our intelligence community” and thus feels emboldened to “kick them when they’re down.” The result has reportedly fueled frustration and anger within the U.S. intelligence community.",20,,,,10

The charges involve alleged attacks on Ukrainian electrical power grids and American businesses, as well as hacking campaigns connected to the 2018 Winter Olympics and the 2017 French elections. The charges do not include allegations of attempts to interfere in the 2020 U.S. presidential election. President Donald Trump has downplayed the threat that Russia poses to the United States, because Russian President Vladimir Putin backs Trump’s re-election. Putin has been supportive of Trump, and the CIA believes he is likely directing efforts to aid Trump’s 2020 campaign. U.S. intelligence officials have said that Russia is using a variety of measures to attack Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden’s campaign. The Russian military intelligence unit allegedly involved in the hacks that Demers described Monday is the same group behind the Russian attack on the 2016 election ― which favored Trump. One of the members of the newly indicted group was previously indicted by Robert Mueller’s special counsel team. A Justice Department official told reporters that bringing the cases is important even if the defendants are unlikely to be extradited from Russia. There should be no safe haven abroad for criminals who attack Americans, the official said, and U.S. officials want suspects to be looking over their shoulders and keeping in mind consequences when they participate in Russian military intelligence activities.

2020-10-12,HuffPost,https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-putin-2020_n_5f84cc7dc5b6e5c3200265d4,"3 Weeks To Go And Putin Could Still Help Trump, Ex-Administration Official Says","WASHINGTON ― With just three weeks before the Nov. 3 election, one major question remains unanswered: What does Russian dictator Vladimir Putin have up his sleeve to help President Donald Trump? “I don’t think they want to miss this opportunity, to poke the United States one more time,” said Miles Taylor, once the chief of staff at Trump’s Department of Homeland Security and now a fierce Trump critic. FBI Director Christopher Wray told Congress last month that Russia is already interfering in the 2020 election by “actively” spreading propaganda through social media and friendly news outlets “primarily to denigrate (former) Vice President (Joe) Biden,” Trump’s Democratic challenger. What’s unclear is if that is the extent of the effort, or if something else is in the works for the campaign’s closing days. Four years ago, Russia was releasing emails stolen from Democrat Hillary Clinton’s campaign on a daily basis through its ally, WikiLeaks, and Trump was citing them at his rallies as proof of his opponent’s “corruption.” “We love WikiLeaks,” he said repeatedly. Taylor said that campaigns have gotten more careful about online security since 2016, but that it was possible Russia still plans some type of propaganda dump targeting Biden in the coming weeks. He said Putin could also be planning something to disrupt the election itself ― sabotaging key polling places in swing states, or taking down the power grid in a major city ― although something that dramatic was less likely. More important, Taylor said, is Trump’s attitude toward Putin. “There’s a concern that the president is passively welcoming that assistance from the Russians.” Trump has over the past four years repeatedly shown his willingness to receive foreign help to win and his unwillingness to tell Putin to stay out of U.S. elections. In 2016, he solicited help from Russia, and then centered his entire campaign during the final month on that material stolen by Russian spies ― even though he had been told it had been stolen by Russian spies. In 2018, Trump refused to warn Putin against interfering in the midterms, even though his top national security officials were asking him to do so. “He failed to do it. He actively declined,” Taylor said. And in 2019, Trump tried to extort Ukraine’s new president into smearing Biden ― the Democrat he feared most as a 2020 opponent ― based on a conspiracy theory being pushed by Russian intelligence. Trump wound up getting impeached for his actions, but all save one Republican senator voted to acquit him, letting him remain in office. An official at the Russian embassy in Washington denied that the country’s government had helped Trump in 2016, and claimed it was the U.S. that was interfering with Russia. “The time has come to stop poisoning the atmosphere of relations with baseless allegations,” the official said. “As Joe Biden has said for months, it is absolutely clear who Vladimir Putin wants to win this election — because Donald Trump's foreign policy has been a gift to the Kremlin” The White House did not respond to queries on the matter, continuing a pattern that began in 2017. No White House or Trump campaign official has ever provided an answer as to why Trump accepted Russian help, knowing that it was Russian help, with the exception of his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani. He told HuffPost in 2018 that the stolen emails that Trump touted daily from Oct. 10 through 2016′s Election Day were “sort of like a gift.” One National Security Council official, who would speak only on condition of anonymity to defend Trump, said: “As the president has said, the United States will not tolerate foreign interference in our electoral processes and will respond to malicious foreign threats that target our democratic institutions.” The official claimed that Trump had said this during a March 2018 news conference. However, a review of Trump’s news conferences that month found only one in which Trump addressed the issue, on March 6 during a joint appearance with Sweden’s prime minister. Asked whether he was worried about Russia interfering in the coming midterms, Trump answered: “No, because we’ll counteract whatever they do. We’ll counteract it very strongly. And we are having strong backup systems.” Two months later, after the intelligence community found evidence that Russia was, in fact, trying to interfere in the November vote, national security officials urged Trump to specifically tell Russia to back off or face consequences. Not only did he refuse to do so, but he did the exact opposite in July, at a news conference in Helsinki standing beside Putin himself. Asked whether he believed his intelligence community about Putin’s 2016 involvement in his own election or Putin’s denials, Trump sided with Putin. “President Putin was extremely strong and powerful in his denial today,” he said. The Russians did wind up trying to interfere in the 2018 election against candidates it deemed unfriendly, leading to officials in the national security agencies ― sometimes under the radar of the White House ― to take action on their own, Taylor said. Sanctions were imposed by the Treasury Department in September 2019 against the operators of the “troll factory” that worked to influence the 2018 election. On one occasion, sanctions against Russians received Trump’s sign-off after a document that required his signature was inserted into a larger stack of paperwork he had to sign, Taylor said. The Treasury Department more recently sanctioned a Ukrainian lawmaker who had been working with Giuliani to spread unsubstantiated corruption allegations against Biden, describing Andrii Derkach as a Russian intelligence operative. Those claims had been the basis of Trump’s own groundless allegations against Biden, the pursuit of which ultimately led to his impeachment. “This president is even giving Russia impunity for offering bounties to terrorists for murdering American troops,” said Biden campaign spokesman Andrew Bates. “As Joe Biden has said for months, it is absolutely clear who Vladimir Putin wants to win this election — because Donald Trump’s foreign policy has been a gift to the Kremlin.”",20,,,,1

The FBI chief testified before the House Homeland Security Committee during its annual hearing on worldwide threats, addressing election interference and domestic terror in the U.S. “We certainly have seen very active, very active efforts by the Russians to influence our election in 2020 through what I would call more the maligned foreign influence side of things ― social media, use of proxies, state media, online journals, etc. ― in an effort to both sow divisiveness and discord and ... primarily to denigrate Vice President Biden and what the Russians see as kind of an anti-Russian establishment,” he said. Wray added that the FBI has not yet seen evidence of Russia targeting election infrastructure, or “cybertargeting,” like the agency saw in the 2016 election. FBI Director Wray: ""We certainly have seen very active, very active efforts by the Russians to influence our election in 2020...to both sow divisiveness and discord and...to denigrate Vice President Biden.""Full video here:  The FBI director warned Congress back in July 2019 that Russia was still intent on trying to interfere in the 2020 presidential election despite U.S. efforts to combat such threats. Trump sidelined then-outgoing national intelligence director Joseph Maguire earlier this year after a member of his team briefed the House that Russia was trying to interfere in the election in Trump’s favor. The statements echo intelligence officials who in early August presented classified information to Congress and presidential campaigns about Russia’s efforts to influence the 2020 election and American democracy. In an Aug. 7 statement, National Counterintelligence and Security Center Director William Evanina said that Russia had targeted Biden in a scheme. “This is consistent with Moscow’s public criticism of him when he was Vice President for his role in the Obama Administration’s policies on Ukraine and its support for the anti-Putin opposition inside Russia,” Evanina wrote. “For example, pro-Russia parliamentarian Andriy Derkach is spreading claims about corruption ― including through publicizing leaked phone calls ― to undermine former Vice President Biden’s candidacy and the Democratic Party. Some Kremlin-linked actors are also seeking to boost President Trump’s candidacy on social media and Russian television.” Derkach was working with Trump’s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani and right-wing One America News network to push the conspiracy theory that Biden acted improperly when he worked to remove a corrupt Ukrainian prosecutor while vice president so he could protect a company his son Hunter Biden was working for. Trump, who was impeached last year for trying to extort Ukraine’s new president into investigating Biden, has continued to push the smear despite officials in his own administration labeling Derkach’s work as part of an ongoing Russian effort to influence the upcoming election. OANN is trying to cover up its past relationship with Andrii Derkach, an active Russian agent involved in Moscow's anti-Biden meddling. OANN gave him tons of free airtime and promoted his wacko conspiracy theories. Just weeks after Evanina’s statement, newly appointed Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe announced that the intelligence community would halt in-person election security briefings to Congress and instead only provide written reports. The move enraged Democrats who said the hearings allow for questions and transparency to the American public, but Ratcliffe justified the decision by saying it would be easier to avoid leaks and prevent information from being “politicized.” Earlier this month, a senior Department of Homeland Security aide filed an explosive whistleblower complaint laying out a pattern of behavior by top Trump appointees ― like acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf and his deputy Ken Cuccinelli ― to manipulate or block intelligence reports that could undermine the president’s political objects or reflect poorly on the leader who welcomes help from the Kremlin and far-right extremists. The complaint by Brian Murphy, former head of DHS’s Office of Intelligence and Analysis, shed new light on the Trump administration’s efforts to deceive Congress and suppress and distort intelligence about Russian political interference and the associated threat of white supremacy ahead of the election. Notably, Wolf did not appear Thursday to testify before the congressional committee created to help protect the U.S. from foreign and domestic threats. “Mr. Wolf may attempt to evade oversight and the Department may try silly stunts to distract from this hearing, but we will not waiver [sic]. The stakes are just too high,” committee Chairman Rep. Bennie Thompson (D-Miss.) said in a statement. “Indeed, former Department officials ― the Administration’s own political appointees ― are coming forward to sound the alarm that our Nation’s security is being compromised in favor of the President’s political interests.” Dan Coats speaks out; pay attention:“No American, and certainly no American leader, should want such an outcome. Total destruction and sowing salt in the earth of American democracy is a catastrophe well beyond simple defeat and a poison for generations.” Trump’s former intelligence director Dan Coats, who served from 2017 to 2019, penned an op-ed in The New York Times on Thursday on how the upcoming election will determine whether democracy in the U.S. can survive. “Our democracy’s enemies, foreign and domestic, want us to concede in advance that our voting systems are faulty or fraudulent; that sinister conspiracies have distorted the political will of the people; that our public discourse has been perverted by the news media and social networks riddled with prejudice, lies and ill will; that judicial institutions, law enforcement and even national security have been twisted, misused and misdirected to create anxiety and conflict, not justice and social peace,” Coats wrote. “If those are the results of this tumultuous election year, we are lost, no matter which candidate wins. No American, and certainly no American leader, should want such an outcome,” he continued. “Total destruction and sowing salt in the earth of American democracy is a catastrophe well beyond simple defeat and a poison for generations.” Check out HuffPost’s 2020 Election Hub here.",20,,,,1

A Homeland Security Whistleblower Adds To The Evidence.,"An explosive whistleblower complaint filed by a senior Department of Homeland Security aide this week has shed new light on efforts by President Donald Trump’s administration to deceive Congress and suppress and manipulate intelligence about Russian political interference and the related threat of white supremacy in advance of the 2020 election. In the complaint, Brian Murphy, the former head of DHS’s Office of Intelligence and Analysis, laid out a damning pattern of behavior by top Trump appointees ― most notably Acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf and his second-in-command, Ken Cuccinelli ― to distort or block intelligence reports that could undermine Trump’s political objectives or reflect poorly on a president who has openly courted both the Kremlin and far-right extremists in America. Murphy’s complaint is a shocking document that would upend any other administration in recent memory. But it’s also just another data point in an incendiary emerging story: Russia is clearly trying to influence the presidential election, and the Trump administration has doggedly tried to keep both Congress and the public in the dark about those efforts. Democratic lawmakers have also tried to sound the alarm but have been handcuffed by what they say is the Trump administration’s unnecessary classification of election security intelligence, particularly with regard to the Russian threat. Last month, Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) issued a dire warning in a Washington Post op-ed after reviewing classified material that he described as “more chilling” than anything special counsel Robert S. Mueller III turned up in his investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election. “The warning lights are flashing red. America’s elections are under attack,” Blumenthal wrote. “[T]the Trump administration is keeping the truth about a grave, looming threat to democracy hidden from the American people.” Murphy, a Marine veteran and former FBI special agent who said he was responsible for all intelligence activities at the Department of Homeland Security from March 2018 until being reassigned last month, has produced some of the strongest evidence to date that Trump has politicized elements of the intelligence community in ways that security experts and members of Congress say put the country at great risk. In his whistleblower complaint, Murphy stated that he filed two Office of the Inspector General reports that seemingly went nowhere about “attempted censorship of intelligence analysis.” He also made numerous other internal complaints. In March and April, for example, he said he submitted six internal complaints to Kash Patel, the acting deputy director for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, about the “improper administration of an intelligence program with respect to Russian disinformation efforts within the United States.” Patel, a former staffer for Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), played a key role in a Republican effort to discredit Mueller’s Russia probe and the FBI’s and Justice Department’s investigation of the Trump campaign’s Russia ties. It’s unclear if Patel responded to Murphy’s concerns. In May, however, Wolf told Murphy to “cease providing intelligence assessments on the threat of Russian interference in the United States,” according to the whistleblower complaint. Wolf told Murphy those instructions came directly from White House national security adviser Robert O’Brien, according to Murphy, who said he refused to comply because “doing so would put the country in substantial and specific danger.” Even before Murphy’s complaint, it was clear that DHS was suppressing intelligence about Russian election interference. In July, the agency withheld publication of a bulletin warning law enforcement agencies about a Russian disinformation plot to “denigrate” the mental health of Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden, according to a recent ABC News report. Trump and his propagandists were already belittling Biden’s health, and an hour after the bulletin was submitted to the agency’s legislative and public affairs office for review, DHS chief of staff John Gountanis intervened to stop publication. The bulletin never circulated. That incident is almost certainly the one described in Murphy’s complaint where he alleges that Gountanis directed him not to disseminate an “intelligence notification regarding Russian disinformation efforts” until clearing it with Wolf. On July 8, Murphy said, he met with Wolf, who told him that the intelligence notification should be “held” because it “made the President look bad.” After Murphy protested, according to his complaint, Wolf excluded him from meetings about the notification, a draft of which was ultimately produced that Murphy felt minimized the actions of Russia. In early August, intelligence officials presented classified information to Congress and presidential campaigns ― the material that “shocked” Blumenthal ― about Russia’s efforts to undermine the election and American democracy. Russia, the information indicated, had targeted Biden in a scheme the U.S. government’s chief counterintelligence official, William Evanina, hinted at in an “election threat update” he released Aug. 7. “We assess that Russia is using a range of measures to primarily denigrate former Vice President Biden and what it sees as an anti-Russia ‘establishment,’” Evanina said. Three weeks later, however, Trump’s newly appointed director of national intelligence, John Ratcliffe, announced that the intelligence community would halt in-person election security briefings to Congress and instead provide only written reports. Ratcliffe justified this decision by saying it would be easier to avoid leaks and prevent information from being “politicized.” The move was met with outrage by congressional Democrats. In a joint statement, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif) and House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif) called it a “betrayal of the public’s right to know how foreign powers are trying to subvert our democracy. This intelligence belongs to the American people, not the agencies which are its custodian. And the American people have both the right and the need to know that another nation, Russia, is trying to help decide who their president should be.” John Cohen, a former undersecretary for intelligence at DHS, told ABC News that “by refusing to brief Congress on a significant threat facing this country, administration officials are placing this country at grave risk.″ Given Murphy’s allegations that Wolf and Cuccinelli ― whom the Government Accountability Office determined were illegally installed in their positions ― told him to manipulate written intelligence reports, the danger is likely worse than imagined. With less than two months to go until the Nov. 3 election, Russia continues to target Biden and undermine U.S. democracy, sometimes with Trump’s assistance. Beyond the warnings from Murphy and Blumenthal, several Russian efforts to disrupt the election have entered public view on their own. Facebook recently took down accounts and pages associated with a Russian influence operation posing as an independent news outlet. The operation published content that investigators at Graphika, a social media analytics firm, described as “an attempt to build a left-wing audience and steer it away from Biden’s campaign, in the same way that the original IRA [Internet Research Agency] tried to depress progressive and minority support for Hillary Clinton in 2016.” The Daily Beast broke news this week that the same Russian operation, patterned after the Russian-based IRA, an organization of professional trolls active in the 2016 election, tried and failed to infiltrate left-wing media outlets such as Jacobin, Truthout and In These Times. CNN reported Wednesday that journalist Bob Woodward revealed in his new book that “the NSA and CIA have classified evidence the Russians had placed malware in the election registration systems of at least two Florida counties, St. Lucie and Washington. While there was no evidence the malware had been activated, Woodward writes, it was sophisticated and could erase voters in specific districts.” On Thursday, Reuters reported that Microsoft recently alerted SKDKnickerbocker, one of Biden’s main election campaign advisory firms, that suspected Russian state-backed hackers had gone after the company with a failed phishing attack to obtain staff passwords and made other attempts at infiltration. The Washington-based firm has close ties with many prominent Democrats. Meanwhile, Trump and his associates are knowingly and openly participating in a Kremlin influence campaign to tarnish Biden and his son Hunter as being involved in corrupt dealings in Ukraine. Trump’s attempt last year to strong-arm Ukranian President Volodymyr Zelensky into announcing an investigation into the unfounded allegations against Biden led to Trump’s impeachment. In his Aug. 7 statement about election threats, Evanina, the intelligence community’s top election security official, issued a clear warning about the ongoing influence campaign against Biden. “[P]ro-Russia Ukrainian parliamentarian Andriy Derkach is spreading claims about corruption ― including through publicizing leaked phone calls ― to undermine former Vice President Biden’s candidacy and the Democratic Party,” Evanina wrote. A week later, Trump retweeted edited audio from one of the leaked tapes that U.S. intelligence officials had flagged as part of Derkach and the Russian government’s disinformation campaign. It was of a purported 2016 call between then-Vice President Biden and then-Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko. The tapes contain edited fragments of unauthenticated conversations. Poroshenko has rejected them as a fabrication by pro-Russian forces in Ukraine. Trump’s personal attorney Rudy Giuliani, who directed efforts to get Zelensky to announce an investigation into Biden, has met at least three times with Derkach, an enigmatic political figure who graduated from a spy academy in Moscow in 1993 and whose father was a longtime KGB officer. On his podcast, Giuliani promoted Derkach’s claims about Biden, which seek to tie the presidential rival to George Soros, the billionaire philanthropist whose support for anti-corruption and pro-democracy initiatives in former Eastern Bloc countries has made him an enemy of the Kremlin. Republicans also consider Soros, who has spent millions of dollars on liberal causes, a political foe — so much so that in 2017, right-wing congressional Republicans such as Sens. Mike Lee (Utah) and Ted Cruz (Texas) joined forces with Russia-backed politicians in Eastern Europe to oppose Soros. Giuliani also worked closely with One America News, a pro-Trump propaganda network, to amplify the Derkach disinformation campaign. OAN conducted interviews with Giuliani and Derkach. And OAN propagandists, such as Jack Posobiec, a far-right protégé of Trump aide and convicted felon Roger Stone, generated additional material in an attempt to link Democrats to corruption in Ukraine and to Soros. The U.S. Treasury Department on Thursday designated Derkach “an active Russian agent for over a decade” who has “close connections with Russian intelligence services” and placed sanctions on him for running an “influence campaign” against Biden. “Derkach waged a covert influence campaign centered on cultivating false and unsubstantiated narratives concerning U.S. officials in the upcoming 2020 Presidential Election,” according to a Treasury Department statement. “Derkach’s unsubstantiated narratives were pushed in Western media through coverage of press conferences and other news events, including interviews and statements.” It can sometimes be hard to separate a Russian propaganda operation from Trump sowing discord for his own purposes. Often they are inseparable. Consider Trump’s “useful idiot” approach to far-right extremism in America. By appealing to racism, authoritarianism and conspiratorial thinking to rally his base, Trump has deepened divisions in the country and accelerated political radicalization. The Trump administration has also consistently whitewashed far-right extremist violence, which federal law enforcement considers the top domestic terrorism threat. Murphy alleges in his complaint that this dangerous practice was still happening at DHS only a few months before the 2020 election. From May through July of this year, he said, Wolf and Cuccinelli unsuccessfully pressured him and other officials to play down the threat of white supremacy in an important “homeland threat assessment” report and instead stoke unfounded fears about “antifa” and anarchists, a stance that lined up with Trump’s misleading “political rhetoric” about left-wing extremism, according to the complaint. But this also matched Russian disinformation designed to stoke chaos and polarization. At a press conference in August, for example, Chanel Rion, the chief White House correspondent for One America News, brought up antifa.com, a mysterious website whose owner had redirected it to point to Biden’s website. Rion used this as an excuse to ask Trump whether Biden should “publicly denounce the antifa as a domestic terrorist organization.” Trump leaped at the opportunity to change the subject from COVID-19 and instead fearmonger about leftist extremism. Yahoo News later traced the antifa.com site to Russia. Another OAN reporter, Kristian Brunovich Rouz, was on the Kremlin payroll and has falsely linked Democrats to antifa (a loosely organized movement of anti-fascist and anti-racist activists) and pushed disinformation about Soros, including accusing him of secretly financing migrant caravans. When Trump suggested in June that an elderly peace activist shoved violently to the ground by Buffalo, New York, police was a member of antifa, he was repeating a baseless conspiracy theory that Rouz broadcast on OAN earlier that day. After Murphy refused to alter his threat assessment to demonize anti-fascists for Trump’s far-right political purposes, Wolf and Cuccinelli tried to block the report, he said. But this was only the latest instance of Trump propaganda running alongside Russian disinformation efforts. Trump’s “white grievance” politics have frequently intersected with Russian disinformation during his presidency. Murphy also alleged that Kirstjen Nielsen, the Homeland Security secretary from December 2017 to April 2019, lied repeatedly under oath to Congress about the number of “known or suspected terrorists” (KSTs) entering the U.S. from Mexico. Murphy put the tally at “no more than three individuals.” He had said Nielsen testified to Congress in December 2018 that DHS had prevented 3,755 KSTs from entering the U.S. via the southern border. However, Nielsen did not use that figure in her testimony. In a supplemental statement, Murphy alleged that she provided that number to Congress in other ways. In October 2018, Nielsen’s aides unsuccessfully pressured Murphy’s office to have intelligence assessments support a Trump administration “policy argument” that KSTs were pouring across the border. At the time, Nielsen was briefing Trump on the progress of a caravan of migrants headed toward the U.S. from Central America. While Trump ranted on Twitter about “criminals and unknown Middle Easterners” arriving, pro-Trump propagandists began spreading a conspiracy theory that Soros ― the lead bogeyman in anti-Semitic Russian disinformation schemes ― had financed the caravan. Posobiec, who works openly with neo-Nazis and has routinely downplayed Russian political interference while being heavily promoted by both the Russian government and Trump, implied on Twitter that Soros had rented RVs for migrants, according to a USA Today investigation. Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), who associates with a Holocaust denier who has participated in Russian election interference efforts, suggested on Twitter that Soros had given cash to caravan members. After Donald Trump Jr. retweeted Gaetz, the disinformation went viral. A few days later, 11 people were killed at a Pittsburgh synagogue. The man charged in the massacre is a neo-Nazi gunman who allegedly believed Soros and other Jews had organized the caravan to bring violent “invaders” across the border to kill white people. Four days after the massacre, Trump again suggested that Soros was financing the caravan. The caravan disinformation campaign kicked into high gear as the midterm elections approached in 2018. Two years later, as the country hurtles toward a momentous presidential election, antifa and the Black Lives Matter movement have become the designated foils for Trump and the Kremlin’s white fright propaganda. American voters still know far too little about how Russia is undermining democracy to benefit Trump. But they know enough now to know that Trump is along for the ride.",20,,,,13
2020-08-11,HuffPost,https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-intel-briefings-gone_n_5f32f2b9c5b6fc009a5e72e3,Trump Has Nearly Eliminated Intelligence Briefings From His Schedule Entirely,"UPDATE: In April 2021, 10 months after The New York Times, Associated Press and Washington Post reported on U.S. intelligence that Russia had offered secret bounties to the Taliban for the deaths of Americans, the Biden administration said that CIA analysts only have “low to moderate confidence” that the bounty program ever existed. WASHINGTON ― President Donald Trump’s interest in taking intelligence briefings has been declining steadily since his first months in office and has dropped to near zero in recent weeks, according to a HuffPost review of all of his daily schedules. Trump went from a high of 4.1 briefings per week on average in March 2017 to 0.7 per week since July 1, shortly after it became public that he had ignored intelligence reports about Russia offering bounties to the Taliban for each American soldier killed in Afghanistan. Monday’s briefing, in fact, was the first in August and the first since July 22. That month had only three briefings scheduled. “It’s remarkable that, even at their peak, they never exceeded 20 per month,” said Ned Price, a former CIA analyst and a spokesman for the National Security Council during the Obama administration. “And now that they are arguably more important than ever, as foreign actors are again interfering in our democracy, tensions with Beijing are swirling, and America’s adversaries and competitors are becoming more emboldened, the president can’t seem to find the time to be briefed,” he added. Briefings from intelligence community officials are based on a package of report summaries from around the world prepared in the pre-dawn hours each morning specifically for the president. The sessions are among the few responsibilities in the modern presidency that cannot be delegated to others. Both of Trump’s immediate predecessors took daily briefings in the White House. Republican George W. Bush typically had his shortly after his arrival in the Oval Office at 6:45 a.m. each day. Democrat Barack Obama had the written material, known as the “President’s Daily Brief,” loaded onto his iPad by 6 a.m. each day, when he would read it prior to the in-person session later in the morning. Trump, by contrast, rarely gets to the West Wing before noon after spending much of each morning watching television and posting tweets based on his viewing. He displayed a diligence toward intelligence briefings only briefly, upon first taking office. In March 2017 he had 18 scheduled briefings on the 23 available weekdays. In April 2017, he had 17 briefings on the 20 available weekdays. But starting that May, right after he fired FBI Director James Comey for failing to end the investigation into the assistance his campaign received from Russia, the frequency of his briefings fell dramatically. Up until that day, May 9, Trump had taken 54 intelligence briefings in his 110 days in office, an average of 3.4 per week. In the 1,200 days since then, he has received 281 briefings, an average of only 1.6 per week. White House officials for years have denied that Trump has been getting briefings more and more infrequently, insisting that the public schedule does not always reflect the briefings he receives. They have declined to explain why some briefings wind up on the public schedule but not others. On Tuesday, though, White House communications director Alyssa Farah said: “The president is briefed on critical intelligence daily by his national security adviser, his career CIA briefer, and/or his chief of staff. He also takes part in full formal presidential intelligence briefings near weekly or every other week with the CIA director, national security adviser, director of national intelligence, White House counsel, and usually the secretary of treasury, secretary of state, and sometime the secretary of defense in person in the Oval Office.” “Trump has demonstrated time and again that he’s not one to put America’s national security first.” Trump himself, asked about intelligence briefings in a recent interview with Axios, called the reports of the Russian bounties “fake news,” that they had “never reached” his desk, and that he does read the PDBs and is regularly briefed. “I read a lot. I spend a lot of time at meetings. Usually it’s once a day or at least two or three times a week, intelligence meetings,” Trump said. One former top White House aide, asked on condition of anonymity whether Trump actually took more intelligence briefings than were reflected on his public schedules, began laughing aloud. The aide’s reaction was the same when asked whether Trump reads the intelligence briefing books prepared for him. Trump’s last national security adviser, John Bolton, has stated publicly that Trump does not read his intelligence briefing book and that making him absorb information was a difficult challenge. “He’s just not receptive to new facts,” Bolton told CBS News last month. “The intelligence briefings don’t communicate as much information as they should. We tried to think of ways to change that. I think it was probably a doomed effort.” Trump’s engagement on intelligence has become a major issue in his reelection bid, after reports earlier this year that he ignored warnings in his PDBs in January that a pneumonia-like virus was spreading in China. Trump did not have a briefing on his schedule until Jan. 6, a week after Taiwanese authorities raised the alarm with U.S. officials about an epidemic on the mainland. He then spent more than two months downplaying the virus and praising China’s dictator for his great work and “transparency” in controlling the coronavirus, even as it had gained a foothold in the United States and was spreading across the country. Months later, first The New York Times and then other outlets reported that Trump had ignored intelligence that Russia was paying rewards of up to $100,000 per American soldier murdered in Afghanistan. Trump has called those reports “a hoax” and “fake news” and acknowledged that he has never raised the issue with Russian dictator Vladimir Putin in the numerous phone calls they have shared this year. “Whether it’s ignoring the impending pandemic or looking the other way in response to Moscow’s bounties on our service members, Trump has demonstrated time and again that he’s not one to put America’s national security first,” Price said. “Especially when doing so comes into conflict with what’s best for him politically.”",20,,,,25

A group of veterans opposed to President Donald Trump released a new video calling him out over reports that the U.S. government knew the Russian military paid bounties to Afghan militants for killing American soldiers. On Friday, The New York Times reported that Trump was briefed on the situation in March, but took no action against Russia. To the contrary, Trump said he would like to invite Russian President Vladimir Putin to the next G-7 meeting in September. Trump said on Twitter that he was not briefed about the alleged bounties, called the Times “fake news” and claimed “nobody’s been tougher on Russia” than his administration. VoteVets ripped into him. “Putin owns Donald Trump,” the organization wrote on Twitter, along with the #TRE45SON hashtag that went viral over the weekend. The group also released a new video: “Intelligence reports on his desk. He says nothing to his master.

President Donald Trump on Sunday said that he was never briefed about an alleged plot by Russian operatives to pay Taliban-linked militants in Afghanistan to kill American troops because U.S. intelligence officials did not find it credible. “Possibly another fabricated Russia Hoax, maybe by the Fake News [New York Times] wanting to make Republicans look bad!!!” he tweeted. Intel just reported to me that they did not find this info credible, and therefore did not report it to me or @VP. Possibly another fabricated Russia Hoax, maybe by the Fake News @nytimesbooks, wanting to make Republicans look bad!!! In an earlier tweet, Trump accused The New York Times of using a fake “anonymous source” to report the alleged briefing. In fact, the Times report cited multiple officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity. It’s not uncommon for news outlets to grant anonymity to sources who aren’t authorized to speak publicly about information that may be newsworthy. “Everybody is denying it & there have not been many attacks on us,” Trump tweeted. He added of the Times report: “Who is their ‘source’?” The Fake News @ nytimes must reveal its “anonymous” source. Bet they can’t do it, this “person” probably does not even exist! The Times was the first to report on the alleged Russian operation. It was later confirmed by several outlets, including The Washington Post, The Wall Street Journal and ABC News. All of these outlets reported that Russian intelligence officers offered bounties to Afghan militants to kill soldiers serving with coalition forces in Afghanistan, including U.S. and British troops. As of Sunday, the Times was the only outlet to report that Trump was personally briefed on the matter. The Times also reported that the National Security Council was made aware of the plot in late March. The White House has not yet taken any action against the Russian government in response to the reported plot, according to the Times. The reports sparked renewed accusations from Trump critics who say the president doesn’t take enough action against the Kremlin. Twenty-four Americans were killed in combat in Afghanistan between early 2019 and early 2020, reported the Times. It’s unclear whether any of the bounties Russian operatives may have paid to Afghan militants resulted in the deaths of any American soldiers. White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany said in a statement Saturday that neither Trump nor Pence were briefed on the matter. “The United States receives thousands of intelligence reports a day, and they are subject to strict scrutiny,” McEnany said. She added that her statement “does not speak to the merit of the alleged intelligence but to the inaccuracy of the New York Times story erroneously suggesting that President Trump was briefed on this matter.” Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe also denied that Trump and Pence were made aware of the alleged operation. Former Acting Director National Intelligence Richard Grenell, who served in that position when Trump was allegedly briefed, said Saturday that he had “never heard” of it. “No one would be fine with this if it were true,” Grenell tweeted in response to someone asking whether he was “fine” with the alleged Russian bounties. In their statements, Trump, McEnany and Ratcliffe did not confirm or deny reports that Russian agents offered to pay Afghan militants to kill U.S. soldiers. The Kremlin has denied the existence of any such operation. Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden on Saturday slammed Trump for failing to “sanction and impose any kind of consequences on Russia for this egregious violation of international law.” He called the White House’s inaction a “betrayal of the most sacred duty we bear as a nation — to protect and equip our troops when we send them into harm’s way.” Instead of condemning the alleged Russian bounties, Trump on Sunday ranted about Biden’s statement. “Funny to see Corrupt Joe Biden reading a statement on Russia, which was obviously written by his handlers,” the president tweeted. “Russia ate his lunch and Obama’s lunch during their time in office, so badly that Obama wanted them out of the then-G-8.” Funny to see Corrupt Joe Biden reading a statement on Russia, which was obviously written by his handlers. Russia ate his and Obama’s lunch during their time in office, so badly that Obama wanted them out of the then G-8. U.S. was weak on everything, but especially Russia! Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.), the third-ranking Republican in the House, called on the White House to answer questions about the alleged Russian bounties, including who knew about the plot and when, and what has been done to hold Russian President Vladimir Putin accountable. “Why weren’t the president or vice president briefed?” she tweeted.",20,,,,22

Asked if he believes there are lessons the Trump administration can learn on election meddling, Biden told host Margaret Brennan that the administration is “incapable” of evolving on the matter. “They like this,” the Democratic presidential candidate said during the interview. “Come on, let’s be fair here. They’ve known this for a long time, for three years.” “Every intelligence agency has told them [that the Russians] continue to be engaged in this activity,” he added. “There is not any question anymore. ... And what’s he doing? Zero. What is the Republican leadership in the United States Senate and Congress doing? Zero.” RUSSIAN ELECTION INTERFERENCE: @JoeBiden to @margbrennan: ""Look, this administration is incapable of learning elections. They like this. Come on. Let's be fair here. They've known this for a long time, for three years.""  The U.S. intelligence community’s top election security official reportedly told House lawmakers earlier this month that Russia wants Trump to win reelection in November. Separately, U.S. intelligence officials last month told Sen. Bernie Sanders’ (I-Vt.) presidential campaign that the Kremlin was apparently also seeking to help the Democratic candidate’s bid. Sanders denounced Russia’s interference and demanded Russian President Vladimir Putin “stay out of American elections.” Trump, in contrast, has attacked Democrats over reports that Russia is trying to help him win reelection, accusing those across the aisle of spreading “disinformation.” Russian agents, during the 2016 campaign, hacked into the Democratic National Committee’s server and orchestrated a massive disinformation campaign to help get Trump elected, according to U.S. intelligence agencies. Biden on Sunday said he’s been targeted by Russian bots on Facebook because the Kremlin doesn’t want him to be the Democratic nominee. Asked whether it was Facebook or U.S. intelligence officials who informed him of this, Biden said he was alerted by his staff. “I have not spoken to the intelligence community, but I think the intelligence community should inform the rest of us who are running what they told Senator Sanders,” he said. Trump is “angry” that intelligence officials informed Sanders and other members of Congress about some of Russia’s meddling efforts in the 2020 election cycle, Biden said, adding that the administration must do more to secure the integrity of our elections. “Why in God’s name haven’t we hardened the electoral process, provided ... hundreds of millions of dollars to states to be able to harden their voter rolls, make sure they can’t be attacked ... as a consequence of cyber attacks?” Biden continued. “Why haven’t we provided the capacity for them to be able to have the money to have paper ballots in addition to that?” “This is outrageous,” he said.

When asked by ABC News’ George Stephanopoulos whether he’s seen anything from the intelligence community that indicates Russia is working to bring about Trump’s re-election, national security adviser Robert O’Brien said no. “I haven’t seen any intelligence that Russia is doing anything to attempt to get President Trump re-elected,” O’Brien said, noting that, as a national security adviser, he gets “pretty good access” to information from the intelligence community. The full interview with O’Brien aired on ABC’s “This Week With George Stephanopoulos” on Sunday. A transcript was made public Saturday. ""I haven't seen any intelligence that Russia is doing anything to attempt to get President Trump reelected,"" Robert O'Brien tells @GStephanopoulos amid reports that intel officials told lawmakers Russia is meddling in 2020, with a preference for Trump.  O’Brien called the reports a “non-story,” despite Russia’s history of tampering with elections in Trump’s favor. The intelligence community concluded in 2017 that Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered cyberattacks on the Democratic National Committee with the ultimate aim of helping secure Trump’s victory in the 2016 presidential contest. The Associated Press, citing anonymous sources, received contradicting reports about whether there was intel on Russia pushing for Trump’s reelection. An intelligence official told the AP that intelligence officials did not tell House committee members that Russia was trying to aid Trump’s campaign. However, others familiar with that meeting said Russia was indeed trying to do just that. One source who was present at the meeting with the director of national intelligence’s team said that O’Brien’s claims about Russia and Trump’s re-election campaign “do not accurately reflect” what they themselves heard at that meeting, CNN chief White House correspondent Jim Acosta reported. Speaking to Stephanopoulos, O’Brien did agree with reports that Russia is trying to boost the campaign of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), a front-runner in the Democratic primary. Sanders has emphatically rejected Russia’s help. In his interview with ABC, O’Brien attempted to link Sanders’ honeymoon, which took place in 1988, to Russia’s meddling. “That’s no surprise. He honeymooned in Moscow,” he said. Critics noted that Trump himself has taken numerous trips to Moscow and had business dealings there, including the Miss Universe pageant in 2013 and the Trump Organization’s previous plans to build a tower there. Yes Sanders honeymooned in Moscow as opposed to Trump who held a beauty pageant in Moscow, took money from Moscow investors, hired aides linked to Moscow, heaped praise on Putin, and publicly asked Russia to get his opponent’s emails in the midst of the 2016 election campaign. The most ugly, xenophobic, and casually imperialist thing in here is the handwringing about how Sanders went to Nicaragua and the Soviet Union in the ‘80s. On top of Cold War and dirty wars, it’s this idea that these places are not worth going to at all This is actually terrifying. The New York Times reported earlier this week that intelligence officials briefed the House Intelligence Committee on Russia’s attempts to interfere in the 2020 race in order to get Trump reelected. O’Brien said he had heard of the reports on the House committee being briefed. He admitted he wasn’t there, but claimed that he heard from those briefing the lawmakers that the reports were “not what they intended the story to be.” When asked if he has a responsibility as the national security adviser to find out whether reports that Russia wants Trump to win reelection are valid, O’Brien danced around the question. “I don’t know ― these are leaks,” O’Brien said. “I’m telling you I haven’t seen the intel and I haven’t seen the analysis.” Stephanopoulos interrupted, “Have you asked for it?” “Look, I want to get whatever analysis they’ve got and I want to make sure that the analysis is solid,” O’Brien said. “I mean, you know, from what I’ve heard ― again, this is only what I’m seeing in the press ― it doesn’t make any sense.” Robert O’Brien repeatedly says he has “not seen” U.S. intel reports that Russia is meddling in 2020 to help Trump.@GStephanopoulos: “Don’t you have a responsibility as national security adviser to find out?” O’Brien: ""... I haven’t seen the intel.""  O’Brien also denied reports that Trump scolded outgoing acting director of national intelligence Joseph Maguire after he learned that House lawmakers were briefed on Russia’s alleged attempts to meddle in the 2020 election in Trump’s favor. Trump announced this week that Maguire was leaving his post, and named Richard Grenell, an ally of the president, as his replacement. Marc Short, chief of staff to Vice President Mike Pence, on Sunday echoed O’Brien’s denials about Maguire’s ouster as well as reports that Russia favors Trump. “I think that there’s not intelligence that said that the Russians are trying to help Donald Trump win election,” Short said during an appearance on “Fox News Sunday.” “It’s hard to see why they would be choosing Donald Trump over Bernie Sanders,” he added. Host Chris Wallace noted that Shelby Pierson, the U.S. intelligence community’s top election security official, briefed Congress earlier this month about Russia developing “a preference” for Trump. Short said he wouldn’t comment on the classified congressional meeting, but claimed the president did not receive such information during his own briefing on election security. U.S. intel says Russia is interfering in American elections to help boost President Trump and Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders. Marc Short weighs in on FOX News Sunday: “There is not intelligence that said that the Russians are trying to help Donald Trump win an election.”  On Friday, Sanders denounced Russia’s alleged interference in the election. “Unlike the current president, I stand firmly against their efforts, and any other foreign power that wants to interfere in our election,” Sanders said in a statement. “I don’t care, frankly, who Putin wants to be president,” he continued. “My message to Putin is clear: stay out of American elections, and as president I will make sure that you do. In 2016, Russia used internet propaganda to sow division in our country, and my understanding is that they are doing it again in 2020.”",20,,,,2

He also suggested that House Democrats should consider holding weekly hearings on the threat with Richard Grenell, the new acting director of the Department of National Intelligence. McFaul said it’s no surprise that Russia is again interfering this election season in a bid to sway the vote for Trump — as American intelligence discovered in the 2016 election. “It is an intelligence assessment that Putin seeks Donald Trump’s victory again,” McFaul told Nicolle Wallace on MSNBC’s “Deadline White House.” “To me, that’s no great insight ... [it’s] very clear.” But what needs to be disseminated is what “concrete” steps that Russia, under President Vladimir Putin, may be taking to help make that happen, he added. “Let’s just start declassifying this stuff” before the November election “so the American people know what’s going on. That’s what the Obama administration was criticized for not doing in 2016.” McFaul also warned of the extreme danger of the “politicization of intelligence.” If all intelligence is “filtered through partisan politics, that means that the president is not getting an accurate picture of the threats out there, whether it’s pandemics, or nuclear weapons or terrorist attacks,” he added. Do not politicize intelligence ! #FactsMatter. Joseph Maguire was ousted this week as DNI acting director because Trump was reportedly furious that one of Maguire’s deputies briefed the House Intelligence Committee last week that Russia was again meddling in the presidential campaign in Trump’s favor. At a Las Vegas campaign rally Friday, Trump blasted the latest Russian revelation as Democratic “disinformation” — even though it’s based on information discovered by his own intelligence community. ProPublica reported Friday that Maguire’s replacement, Grenell, a fierce Trump loyalist, worked in 2016 as a consultant for a Moldovan politician later accused of corruption by the U.S. Grenell also failed to notify the U.S. that he was working on behalf of a foreign politician, in apparent violation of the law, according to the online investigative publication.

2019-12-09,HuffPost,https://www.huffpost.com/entry/russia-banned-from-olympic-games-over-doping-scandal_n_5dee24f6e4b07f6835b5da35,Russia Banned From Olympic Games Over Doping Scandal,"MOSCOW, Dec 9 (Reuters) — Russia was banned from the Olympics and world championships in a range of sports for four years on Monday after the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) ruled to punish it for manipulating laboratory data, a WADA spokesman said. WADA’s executive committee took the decision after it concluded that Moscow had tampered with laboratory data by planting fake evidence and deleting files linked to positive doping tests that could have helped identify drug cheats. The WADA committee’s decision to punish Russia with a ban was unanimous, the spokesman said. Russia, which has tried to showcase itself as a global sports power, has been embroiled in doping scandals since a 2015 report commissioned by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) found evidence of mass doping in Russian athletics. Its doping woes have grown since, with many of its athletes sidelined from the past two Olympics and the country stripped of its flag altogether at last year’s Pyeongchang Winter Games as punishment for state-sponsored doping cover-ups at the 2014 Sochi Games. Monday’s sanctions had been recommended by WADA’s compliance review committee in response to the doctored laboratory data provided by Moscow earlier this year. One of the conditions for the reinstatement of Russian anti-doping agency RUSADA, which was suspended in 2015 in the wake of the athletics doping scandal but reinstated last year, had been that Moscow provide an authentic copy of the laboratory data. The sanctions effectively strip the agency of its accreditation. Sports Minister Pavel Kolobkov last month attributed the discrepancies in the laboratory data to technical issues. The punishment, however, leaves the door open for clean Russian athletes to compete at major international sporting events without their flag or anthem for four years, as was the case during the 2018 Pyeongchang Olympics. Some Russian officials, meanwhile, have branded the call for sanctions unfair and likened it to broader Western attempts to hold back the country. If RUSADA appeals the sanctions endorsed by WADA’s executive committee, the case will be referred to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS), WADA has said.
