The anonymous British street artist said Friday that he is behind a mural of a gymnast doing a handstand that was painted on a bombed-out building in liberated Borodyanka, near capital city Kyiv. Banksy confirmed the piece was his via Instagram. A post shared by Banksy (@banksy) Other pieces that have also been pictured in the vicinity have been attributed to the artist, but he has yet to take credit for them. A representative for Banksy, whose artworks can sell for millions of dollars, did not immediately respond to HuffPost’s request for comment. The Ukraine Territorial Defense Forces shared photos of two of the unclaimed artworks on Twitter. One shows a judo match in which a young boy topples someone with a striking resemblance to Russian President Vladimir Putin, who ordered an invasion of Ukraine earlier this year. The other depicts children using a metal tank trap as a seesaw. They are “beautiful pieces of art on the wall of a destroyed building and concrete blocks,” the defense forces wrote. Yesterday morning residents of Borodyanka town in Kyiv region, which was de-occupied in April, found these beautiful pieces of art on the wall of a destroyed building and concrete blocks.Some even think Banksy secretly visited the town.  Another piece believed to be by Banksy shows a gymnast with a neck brace waving a ribbon, reportedly in Irpin. Russian forces captured Borodyanka after launching their invasion in February, but the town was freed in April. This week, Russians also retreated from the southern city of Kherson, a major regional capital.",17,,,,14

It “looks as though the Ukrainians have just won an extraordinary victory, where the one regional capital that Russia had seized in this war is now back under a Ukrainian flag,” Sullivan told reporters on Air Force One as President Joe Biden headed to a summit in Cambodia. Sullivan dismissed calls for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to be open to peace talks with the Kremlin. He said that Ukraine is “the party of peace” in the conflict, while Russia is “the party of war.” Russia could end the war by simply withdrawing from Ukraine, he noted. But if Kyiv’s forces stop fighting, “it would be the end of Ukraine,” warned Sullivan. Kherson has been occupied by Russia since the first weeks of the war. But in recent months, fortunes turned sharply against the Kremlin’s forces as Ukrainian troops with advanced weaponry from the U.S. and other NATO nations began to overtake territory in the northeast and south.

Kherson, the only provincial capital to be captured since Russia’s invasion began in February, was not the only area freed this week. The town of Snihurivka, in the neighboring Mykolaiv region, was liberated Thursday, CNN reported. Residents told the outlet that a police station there was used as a “base of torture.” A 15-year-old girl said she was kidnapped in the final days of the occupation and feared she would be raped, before eventually going free Thursday.

Hugo Bachega was reporting from central Kyiv on the escalating conflict after a bridge connecting the annexed area of Crimea to Russia was blown up on Saturday. The Kremlin has blamed the attack on Ukraine. “So the fear is that this could trigger a very strong Russian response. We saw yesterday that a residential area of the city of Zaporizhzhia, a major city in the south of the country, very close to the front lines was hit,” Bachega said, before he was distracted by the sound of an airborne missile. He ducked out of view of the camera as an explosion was heard. The BBC threw it back to the studio, where the anchor said Bachega had taken cover “for obvious reasons.” Within the hour, Bachega delivered another report, noting that the airstrike had hit close to his hotel in the city center. “We understand that several explosions have happened here in the capital, and we had an update from the emergency services saying that several people have been killed and wounded,” he reported. He later posted on Instagram that he was safe, but was having a “busy and depressing day” reporting from a parking lot, ostensibly underground to shelter from airstrikes.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy applied on Friday for the country to get fast-tracked NATO membership in response to Russia annexing four regions in violation of international law. Ukraine and the West have denounced as a sham Russian President Vladimir Putin’s referendums to annex the regions ― his latest move in the months-long war. A country needs approval from all 30 members to join NATO, and Ukraine has received mixed responses in the past from the alliance due to its geographic proximity to Russia. Being at war complicates the country’s request to join the military alliance. The nine NATO countries that voiced support for Ukraine’s membership are the Czech Republic, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, North Macedonia, Montenegro, Poland, Romania and Slovakia. All of the countries are in Central and Eastern Europe, and could face Russian aggression next if it isn’t stopped in Ukraine. Together with the Presidents of 🇱🇻🇪🇪🇵🇱🇸🇰🇷🇴🇨🇿🇲🇪🇲🇰, we:- Support Ukraine's sovereignty& territorial integrity- Support 🇺🇦 in its defense against Russia's invasion- Firmly stand behind 🇺🇦 future #NATO membership- Call for accountability of war criminals.  “We reiterate our support for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine. We do not recognize and will never recognize Russian attempts to annex any Ukrainian territory,” the statement said. “We firmly stand behind the 2008 Bucharest NATO Summit decision concerning Ukraine’s future membership.” At the 2008 summit, NATO members welcomed Ukraine and Georgia’s desires to join the alliance, but declined to provide a clear timeline for the countries’ path to membership. The letter on Sunday also did not provide such a timeline, though Zelenskyy thanked the countries for publicly supporting Ukraine becoming a member. Finland and Sweden officially applied to join NATO on a fast-track in May out of security concerns following Russia’s invasion. Most member countries have already ratified their applications, and the two nations are on track to join the alliance. White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan said Friday that the U.S. has long supported an open-door policy for NATO, but that the application process for Ukraine “should be taken up at a different time.” “Right now, our view is that the best way for us to support Ukraine is through practical, on-the-ground support in Ukraine,” Sullivan said. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg gave a similar response on Sunday, telling Chuck Todd on NBC’s “Meet the Press” that Ukraine has the right to choose what kind of security arrangements it wants to be part of, but that “any decision on membership has to be taken by consensus.” After the annexation, the U.S. sanctioned over 1,000 people and firms connected to Russia’s invasion, including its Central Bank governor and families of National Security Council members. Sullivan said that sanctions have been a “critical element” to the White House’s strategy against Putin’s regime because of the “economic pressure that we are placing on Russia, and the denial of their ability to gather what they need to be able to regenerate their war machine.”",29,,,,28

The Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine — convened in March and staffed by international legal experts — reported the disturbing findings Friday in Geneva, describing a long list of appalling abuses and atrocities by Russian forces. “Based on the evidence gathered by the commission, it has concluded that war crimes have been committed in Ukraine,” Erik Mose, a Norwegian judge and chairman of the three-member commission, said in a statement to the U.N. Human Rights Council. ""War crimes have been committed in Ukraine.""-- Independent International Commission of Inquiry tells @un_hrc. Among the most disturbing crimes the commission has documented involve cases in which children were “raped, tortured and unlawfully confined,” according to the findings. The age of “victims of sexual and gendered-based violence ranged from 4 to 82 years,” Mose said in a statement. In some cases ”relatives were forced to witness the crimes,” Mose noted in his statement. Children were also killed and wounded in “indiscriminate attacks” on civilians by Russian forces using explosive weapons, the investigation found. Commission members “were struck by a large number of executions and other violations by Russian forces, and the Commission received consistent accounts of torture and ill-treatment,” Mose noted in his statement. The commission is continuing to investigate executions in 16 towns and settlements, and has “credible allegations regarding many more cases of executions, which we are documenting further,” Mose added. Many of the examined bodies showed evidence of “prior detention of the victims, as well as visible signs of executions ... such as hands tied behind backs, gunshot wounds to the head, and slit throats,” the commission found. The findings have been consistent with reports of war crimes from other international human rights groups, Western governments and Ukrainian authorities. The U.N. Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine earlier this year documented illegal killings — including summary executions of civilians — in more than 30 settlements in the Kyiv, Chernihiv, Kharkiv and Sumy regions by Russian armed forces while they controlled these areas in late February and March. The Independent International Commission headed by Mose also investigated atrocities in the same areas. Investigators visited 27 towns and settlements and interviewed more than 150 victims and witnesses, according to the report. They also inspected “sites of destruction, graves, places of detention and torture,” as well as remnants of weapons, said Mose.",13,,,,5

Alexander Drueke and Andy Tai Huynh were released alongside eight other prisoners of war, including citizens from the U.K., Morocco, Sweden and Croatia. Drueke, a former Army staff sergeant who served in Iraq, and Huynh, a former Marine, were captured near the Ukrainian border city of Kharkiv in June. The pair had traveled from Alabama to fight against invading Russian forces. The Saudi Foreign Ministry said that the prisoner swap was brokered by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. The country added that it’s also working to repatriate all the POWs. It’s unclear who was released to Russia as part of the deal. Dianna Shaw, Drueke’s aunt, told The Washington Post on Wednesday that his mother had spoken to him for about 10 minutes after his release. “He sounded clearheaded, with clear speech,” Shaw told the paper. “He sounded like himself.” The prisoner exchange came at a pivotal moment in the Kremlin’s invasion. Russian President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday said he would call up about 300,000 reserve troops to bolster his country’s ongoing attack. The effort comes amid staggering losses for the Russians as its seven-month assault drags on. British Prime Minister Liz Truss thanked Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelenskyy and the Saudis for releasing the U.K. prisoners, saying the exchange had ended “months of uncertainty and suffering for them and their families.” “Hugely welcome news that five British nationals held by Russian-backed proxies in eastern Ukraine are being safely returned,” she tweeted. “Russia must end the ruthless exploitation of prisoners of war and civilian detainees for political ends.” Hugely welcome news that five British nationals held by Russian-backed proxies in eastern Ukraine are being safely returned, ending months of uncertainty and suffering for them and their families.",13,,,,25

Russian space agency Roscosmos announced his death on Monday without disclosing the cause or location. “His research helped prove that the human body is ready for flights not only to near-Earth orbit, but also to deep space,” Roscosmos wrote in a Telegram post. “We express our deepest condolences to the relatives and friends of Valery Vladimirovich.” He was born Valery Ivanovich Korshunov on April 27, 1942, but changed his name after being adopted in 1957, according to the New Mexico Museum of Space History. Polyakov began as a physician and joined the Institute of Biomedical Problems in Moscow in 1971, according to CNN. After undergoing spaceflight training to demonstrate he could administer assistance to fellow astronauts in orbit and passing his exams in 1972, Polyakov became one of the first doctor-cosmonaut trainees in history. He earned his Candidate of Medical Sciences degree in 1976. Polyakov’s first lengthy space mission in 1988 lasted eight months, and he became deputy director of the institute he once joined as a young man upon returning back to Earth. It was his second and final mission, however, that made history. Now a specialist in the nascent field of space medicine, Polyakov volunteered to prove human beings could withstand microgravity and reach Mars, according to Wired. His flight to dock with Russia’s Mir space station launched on Jan. 8, 1994 — and Polyakov didn’t return until March 22, 1995. Polyakov orbited Earth 7,075 times and traveled around 187 million miles during those 14 months — during which millions of people back on Earth had marveled at the launch of the Netscape Navigator internet browser, the opening of the English Channel Tunnel and O.J. Simpson’s high-speed police chase. According to “The Story of Manned Space Stations” by Philip Baker, American astronaut Norman Thagard said Polyakov returned to Earth “big and strong” and looked “like he could wrestle a bear.” Polyakov exercised during his mission and refused assistance upon landing, opting to walk on his own. “When his capsule landed in Kazakhstan he walked from it to a nearby chair, a tremendous achievement,” wrote Baker. “He also stole a cigarette from a friend nearby, but could hardly be blamed for that. He sipped a small brandy and inwardly celebrated his mission.” While NASA astronauts Scott Kelly and Mark Vande Hei respectively spent 340 and 355 consecutive days in space and Peggy Whitson spent 665 cumulative days in space, the consecutive 437-day stay accomplished by Valery Polyakov remains unprecedented. “His record still stands today,” wrote Baker, “and it is unlikely to be broken until man ventures to Mars.”",3,,,,8

Inmates are being offered cash payments and having their sentences commuted to persuade them to sign up for the war in Ukraine. The news comes after Ukraine re-took large parts of previously occupied land in the north and east of the country in what many see as a potential turning point in the war. According to the latest MoD intelligence update, Kremlin-linked private military company the Wagner Group is carrying out the prison recruitment drive. They said the scheme was first launched in July, but has now been “reinvigorated” as Moscow continues to suffer major losses in the war. Latest Defence Intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine - 16 September 2022 Find out more about the UK government's response: #StandWithUkraine 🇺🇦  The MoD said: “Prisoners have been offered commutation of their sentences as well as cash incentives. “This has been reinvigorated, with recently posted video highly likely showing Wagner owner Yevgeny Prigozhin making a recruitment pitch to prisoners. In the video, Prigozhin emphasises that he is only seeking ‘fighters for assault units.’” In a further sign of Russia’s need to get more troops to the frontline, the MoD said Moscow’s military academies “are shortening training courses and bringing cadets graduation dates forwards.” “This is almost certainly so cadets can be deployed to support the Ukraine operation,” they said. “The impact of Russia’s manpower challenge has become increasingly severe. “The acceleration of officer cadets’ training, and Wagner’s demand for assault troops suggests that two of the most critical shortages within the military manning crisis are probably combat infantry and junior commanders.”",14,,,,16

My Country Sees The Truth.,"If it looks like a duck, swims like a duck, quacks like a duck, then there is a very high probability that Russian propaganda will argue this creature is a tiger. In the world Russians live in today, a tiger may well have wings, a beak, and flippers ― if the Kremlin so desires. But in this reality, even darker things are possible. In Russia, nearly a quarter of the population do not have sewage facilities, but missiles are seen as a priority. In Russia, its leaders can weaponize almost one-quarter of the world’s natural gas reserves, but almost one-third of households cannot heat their homes. In Russia, they love “greatness.” But this most nebulous of concepts is never measured by economic development, well-being or quality of life. The Russians measure it by fear. Terror is a part of life in Russia. Paranoia is drummed into its citizens. This has tragic consequences for the outside world. Because Russians fear themselves and what they have become, they seek comfort from harassing others with their “power.” In their view, the more people in the world that suffer at the hands of the Russian government, the mightier their state becomes. In Russia, a death cult reigns supreme. In a country that claims to be a pillar of Christianity, children are taught from a young age that they may very well have to die to promote the glory of the state. Earlier this month, Vladimir Solovyov, a Kremlin propagandist, was filmed telling schoolchildren that “A Russian person is always ready to die. We never know when the Motherland will say: ‘You must!’” Years ago, the pop artist Sting famously sang, “I hope the Russians love their children, too.” I recalled that song in March when I heard a recording of a Russian serviceman as he called his wife from a newly captured town in the Kyiv region. He boasted how he had robbed a Ukrainian family’s home to provide supplies for his own. Thousands of such cases have been documented. Many Russian soldiers come from the poorest regions. Looting in Ukraine has become an easy way to improve the living standards of their loved ones. A mother giving up on her son after he was captured in Ukraine is also a manifestation of love in the warped reality of Russia. When a Ukrainian journalist called her to say her child was in captivity and sitting beside him, the mother replied that she didn’t have a son before hanging up. In the United States, you may be shocked to hear of such callousness. But we can understand this woman. Since Soviet times, Russian prisoners of war have been considered traitors and their relatives often suffer repression. In the basket case that is Russia today, encouraging your husband to maraud through the Kherson region and rape Ukrainian women is probably nothing more than a manifestation of love. In Russia, truth is almost always more terrible than fiction. Of course, other soldiers do not seek permission. The Russian military has used sexual violence as a tool of terror. We have collected thousands of documented cases involving women, men and children. Last week, following six weeks of negotiations, Russia returned the body of Paul Urey, a British aid worker, to Ukraine. He had been captured in April while evacuating civilians from the combat zone in the Zaporizhzhya region. In July, the Russians reported that Urey had died “due to illness and stress.” On Sept. 7, we saw what kind of “illness” he had suffered and what kind of “stress” he had experienced, as his body was returned with “signs of possible unspeakable torture.” Hostage-taking are everyday occurrences for the Russian armed forces. The Security Service of Ukraine has thousands of such records. From the Mykolaiv region, from Kherson, from Chernihiv ― from everywhere Russian soldiers put on their boots. But can we, in all honesty, call them soldiers? Have these servicemen not simply been dehumanized? Perverted by a toxic culture and brainwashed by a sinister propaganda machine, Russia has created a terrifying bloodlust within its armed forces and wider population. This is the reality of a state whose citizens are no longer able to tell the difference between good and evil, or simply right and wrong. A state where the car industry is now reliant not on market demand, but the bodies of the dead. In Ukraine, we were astonished to see online videos showing relatives of those Russians “killed in action” joyfully exchanging their compensation for Ladas. Is this joy sincere? It is hard to tell. After all, the only empire that Russia has ever successfully built is an empire of lies. Here, they call fascists those whom they want to conquer and destroy. Here, the war is called a special operation. Here, the invaders are named liberators. Being a mercenary is prohibited by law, but mercenaries are legally hired all the same. Looting is seen as an achievement. Rapists, torturers and butchers are considered heroes. Russia does not fight terrorists: It pays them for their service. It raises its children to become terrorists. It incites its citizens to terrorism. Regardless of where they are involved ― in the official armed forces, in the unofficial ranks of Wagner, in the FSB, the GRU, Gazprom, or Rosatom ― they all perform the same function. Their overarching objective is to sow terror and hatred, murder and threaten, coerce and blackmail. They are told all this is for the glory of the Russian Land, Terra Russia. So, isn’t it time to finally call it by its real name?",13,,,,9

Footage showed Seagal repeating Russian propaganda talking points at the Russian-occupied site. The Kremlin has alleged Ukraine destroyed the prison with HIMARS rockets provided by the United States. Ukraine has said Russian shelling destroyed the site and called the attack a war crime. “This is where HIMARS hit, 50 people were killed, another 70 were injured,” Seagal said. “It definitely looks like a rocket. If you look at the burning and other details, of course, it’s not a bomb. Not to mention the fact that Russia really has a lot of artifacts from HIMARS.” Military experts said there’s no evidence supporting the claim that U.S. rockets caused the destruction, according to The Washington Post. Seagal also called the dead Olenivka prisoners “Nazis” and alleged Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy himself destroyed the facility to kill one of the inmates, according to New York Post.

More than a million Ukrainians forcibly relocated to Russia since the war in Ukraine started, including more than 180,000 children. An 11-year-old Ukrainian boy, raped as his mother was tied to a chair and forced to watch. The mounting allegations against Russia over its invasion of Ukraine have been described as war crimes or even crimes against humanity. But human rights groups and others are debating if they amount to genocide, at least as defined in international law. Declaring Ukrainians to be the victims of a genocide may not have huge practical implications, but the historic weight of the word, with its overtones of the Holocaust, the killing fields of Cambodia and the breakup of Yugoslavia, may matter more. War crimes and crimes against humanity are deplored, but genocide by its nature implies the need for more forceful, immediate action. And though President Joe Biden has said he thinks it’s genocide, that concern over the obligations the label would impose may be why there’s wariness on Capitol Hill to follow suit. Rep Steny Hoyer (Md.), the second-ranking Democrat in the House and a former chair of the human rights-focused U.S. Helsinki Commission, said he was not sure if the word “genocide” was applicable because he thought of it in terms of ethnic groups. “The way I think about genocide is Hitler getting rid of the Jews or, frankly, to some degree, what we did with Indians or what Christians did to the Muslims because they were Muslims in the Crusades,” he said. Though that perception is widely shared, it’s actually not the definition under international law. “People confuse genocide with mass murder and mass atrocities,” said Azeem Ibrahim, director of special initiatives for the New Lines Institute for Strategy and Policy in Washington, pointing to the definition in a 1948 international treaty. “The number of people being killed is not relevant to what the Genocide Convention actually says. What is relevant is the intent of the parties to eliminate a group in whole or in part using all the various means at their disposal,” he said. If that intent exists, genocide can include: The accusations against Russia certainly check off many of those boxes. Aside from the above incidents cited in a report by New Lines and the Raoul Wallenberg Centre for Human Rights, Russia has been accused of indiscriminately bombing civilian targets, including apartment buildings and malls; blocking the transport of and stealing Ukrainian grain exports; and bombing health care facilities, including a maternity hospital in Mariupol. In April, Dmitry Peskov, a spokesperson for Russian President Vladimir Putin, denied Russian troops had committed atrocities. Russia has also claimed that conditions in the eastern part of Ukraine it had seized were akin to genocide for Russian-speaking people before it invaded. Still, the report by New Lines and the Wallenberg Centre said Russia was guilty of “incitement to commit genocide” and a “pattern of atrocities” from which an intent to destroy the Ukrainian people could be inferred. Human Rights Watch, a New York-based group, said it is observing and documenting what’s happening in Ukraine. Rachel Denber, the group’s deputy director for Europe and Central Asia, said it was documenting “grave breaches” of international law and “heinous acts of murder, torture, inhuman conditions of detention.” “I think it’s really important to focus on the evidence that we are documenting and what it is that our findings are so far because they’re really quite serious. The crime of genocide has a very specific threshold for intent, and while evidence of intent may become apparent, for now the most effective thing we can do is to continue to do our documentation of the conduct of the Russian forces,” she said. But even some old foreign policy hands on Capitol Hill are reluctant to go as far as the human rights community may be headed. “I don’t put this in the same category as the Holocaust,” said Rep. Brad Sherman (D-Calif.), a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee since 1997. “I guess if you looked at the whole of Ukraine together, you could add up a lot of atrocities that might add up to [genocide].” Sherman, who supports aiding Ukraine, said the cost of justice has to be weighed against the costs to the U.S., the costs to the Ukrainians fighting and the risk of a nuclear war. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), a staunch Ukraine supporter, also demurred when asked if he thought Russia had crossed the line. “I’m in favor of helping Ukraine and giving them what they need to beat the Russians,” he said. “If you could walk the streets of Irpin and Hostomel, like I did, and listen to the stories that those people told about what the Russian soldiers did — this is a genocide. The world needs to recognize it as such.” The State Department, which has recognized three instances of genocide since 2021 — the treatment of Muslim Uyghurs in China, the Rohingya in Burma and the Armenians in Turkey in 1915 — also has yet to follow Biden’s lead to add Ukraine to that list. “We are aware of the New Lines Institute report. We are deeply concerned by the report’s findings and by what we are seeing, particularly with respect to the apparent gratuitousness of violence by members of Russia’s forces,” a State Department spokesperson told HuffPost. “That is why we are working with allies and partners to gather, review and preserve evidence of atrocities and make it available to the appropriate bodies to hold those responsible to account.” In the Senate, though, two members of the Foreign Relations Committee have no doubts. “There is no question that what Russia is doing in Ukraine is a genocide,” Sen. Jim Risch (Idaho), the top Republican on the panel, told HuffPost. “If you could walk the streets of Irpin and Hostomel, like I did, and listen to the stories that those people told about what the Russian soldiers did ― this is a genocide. The world needs to recognize it as such,” he said. “I think they’ve passed the international definition of genocide,” said Sen. Ben Cardin (D-Md.). “I thought they passed that a while ago. Transporting people, in some cases unaccompanied children, into Russia with clear intentions of removing them from their culture, that’s genocide.” Under the Genocide Convention, countries are required to take measures to prevent and punish genocide. The U.S., which has signed on to the treaty, has provided assistance to Ukraine to investigate and document “war crimes and other atrocities” in addition to imposing punishing economic sanctions and providing weapons and training to Ukraine. “The ‘prevent’ comes first. The entire purpose of the convention, its primary purpose, is to prevent genocide from happening.” Risch said the United States is already doing a lot, but not enough. “I personally would do more,” he said, declining to elaborate. Risch said he thinks the wariness to call what is happening genocide may stem from unfamiliarity with the definition. “The Holocaust is the Holocaust. This, like many genocides, has its own marks and should be judged in that regard,” he said. Ibrahim, from New Lines, said the focus should not be on whether the definition has been met because the mere risk of genocide, which has been documented in their report, was enough to trigger the genocide treaty’s obligations. The question, he said, was whether the 150-plus countries that signed the Genocide Convention would live up to their obligations. “This is important because what’s happened too often in our lifetimes is whether something is a genocide or not becomes an academic exercise after the fact,” he said. “The ‘prevent’ comes first. The entire purpose of the convention, its primary purpose, is to prevent genocide from happening.”",13,,,,3

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Russia attacked the mall on Monday while over 1,000 people were inside. The attack killed at least 18 people, while 36 remain missing, according to Human Rights Watch. Russia’s defense ministry denied the attack was meant to target civilians, according to Reuters. “In Kremenchuk, Russian forces struck a weapons depot storing arms received from the United States and Europe with high-precision air-based weapons,” the ministry said in a daily statement Tuesday on the state of the war. The Russians also disputed Zelenskyy’s statement that the mall was crowded. “The detonation of stored ammunition for Western weapons caused a fire in a non-functioning shopping centre located next to the depot,” the statement continues. CCTV footage, cited by The Guardian, showed there were two missiles fired in the area within minutes of each other. The first hit the shopping mall, while the second struck a nearby factory, the one Russia claims was used to store weapons. Human Rights Watch said it conducted two in-site investigations at the factory in question and did not uncover any evidence to support Russia’s claims that the facility was used to store military equipment provided by the West. “It’s a place for making road equipment, machines for road construction,” Svitlana Rybalko, from the regional State Emergency Service, told the BBC. “There’s also a greenhouse nearby where workers grow cucumbers.” The BBC reported that the factory is about 300 meters away from the shopping center, separated by a wall and rail tracks. This shows that Russia’s claims that “secondary explosions” are responsible for a fire inside the mall are “unlikely,” the BBC wrote. Witnesses have also cast doubt on Russia’s allegation that the mall was not in operation. The BBC labeled the claim as “false” after talking to several staff and shoppers, including a woman living in a village nearby who regularly visits the area for shopping and said the mall has been “constantly open.” The woman showed the BBC video shot inside the mall two days before the attack, with shoppers walking around and stores open for business. Human Rights Watch said it spoke to 15 people, including local officials and some of those injured in the attack, who confirmed the center was open to the public. Dmitry Polyanskiy, Russia’s deputy ambassador to the United Nations, on Monday presented another allegation ― which contradicts the defense ministry’s statement on Tuesday ― claiming the attack was staged. “Looks like we are dealing with a new #Bucha-style #Ukrainian provocation,” Polyanskiy tweeted. Russia previously claimed that photos and videos of atrocities committed by its soldiers in Bucha, Ukraine, were fake. Looks like we are dealing with a new #Bucha-style #Ukrainian provocation. One should wait for what our Ministry of Defence will say, but there are too many striking discrepancies already. Exactly what Kiev regime needs to keep focus of attention on #Ukraine before #NATOSummit In another Twitter message, reported by the BBC, Polyanskiy said his tweet did not contradict Russia’s Ministry of Defense. Polanskiy added reports of the attack “will be used by Ukraine to attract as much attention as possible through promoting [a] false version of what happened.” Reports of the incident have garnered the attention of world leaders. French President Emmanuel Macron on Tuesday called the attack “a new war crime.” “Russia cannot and should not win,” Macron said at the end of the G-7 summit in Germany, according to The Associated Press. Zelenskyy also addressed the U.N. Security Council on Tuesday saying Russia is a “terrorist state,” committing “daily terrorist acts.” “We need to act urgently to do everything to make Russia stop the killing spree,” Zelenskyy said.",17,,,,25

What Does That Mean For Ukraine War?,"The Kremlin has fired several senior officials managing its invasion of Ukraine, yet another sign that the Russian war effort is significantly faltering. In its latest Twitter update, the British Ministry of Defence (MoD) claimed that Moscow’s centralized command is only going to come under more pressure as it tries to re-establish control behind the scenes. The MoD explained that Russia “has fired senior commanders who are considered to have performed poorly during the opening stages of its invasion of Ukraine.” Lieutenant General Serhiy Kisel, who commanded the elite 1st Guards Tank Army, has been suspended after he was unable to capture Ukraine’s second-largest city Kharkiv. Ukrainian resistance “appear to have won the battle of Kharkiv” according to the U.S. think tank Institute for the Study of War, after Russian units were unable to hold their lines around the city. Russia has been bombarding the city since the war began three months ago, but the troops were not able to even encircle Kharkiv and were subsequently expelled. The commander behind Russia’s Black Sea Fleet, Vice Admiral Igor Osipov, is also likely to have been suspended after the cruiser Moskva sank in April. It was Russia’s flagship Black Sea missile cruiser which was struck down by two Ukrainian missiles, a huge symbolic and military blow to the Kremlin at a time when it was already losing morale. The U.K. officials also think that Russian chief of the General Staff Valeriy Gerasimov is still in post, “but it is unclear whether he retains the confidence of President Putin.” Without a clear command system, the Russian forces – already said to be disorganized and lacking supplies – are unlikely to secure any victories in Ukraine any time soon. As the MoD summarized: “A culture of cover-ups and scape-goating is probably prevalent within the Russian military and security system. “Many officials involved in the invasion of Ukraine will likely be increasingly distracted by efforts to avoid personal culpability for Russia’s operational set-backs. “This will likely place further strain on Russia’s centralized model of command and control, as officers increasingly seek to defer key decisions to their superiors. “It will be difficult for Russia to regain the initiative under these conditions.” Latest Defence Intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine - 19 May 2022 Find out more about the UK government's response: #StandWithUkraine 🇺🇦  There seems to be a major problem with top military officials within the Russian forces right now. Ukraine’s ministry of defense claimed earlier this month that U.S. intelligence has helped it to find and kill 12 Russian generals since the war began. Neither Russia nor the U.S. have confirmed this number, although the U.S. National Security Council later claimed that it was providing “battlefield intelligence” to Ukraine, and did not have intent “to kill Russian generals.” While the details of this claim remain unclear, this is just one of many signs that central control is falling apart in Russia. President Vladimir Putin is also said to have taken over the day-to-day management of the war, despite such tasks typically falling to more junior commanders. “We think Putin and Gerasimov are involved in tactical decision-making at a level we would normally expect to be taken by a colonel or a brigadier,” a Western military source said, according to the Guardian. Yohann Michel, defence and military research analyst at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, told the i newspaper: “If you’re trying to be both general and captain, you are usually doing neither and you are creating uncertainty at every level of the chain of command.” He added: “The Russian armed forces don’t need to have this level of micro-management from the top who have problems of their own.” Russia’s war effort is going so badly even a retired colonel broke rank on state TV and admitted: “Sometimes information is being spread about some sort of psychological breakdown in Ukraine’s Armed Forces, suggesting some sort of a breakthrough is imminent. “None of this has a basis in reality.”",14,,,,16

Why Is It Considering Membership?,"Sweden is still weighing up the prospect of NATO membership while its neighbor Finland has already announced it is firmly in favour of joining in the face of Russia’s invasion of neighboring Ukraine and its ongoing military aggression. Joining the U.S.-led military alliance would mark a radical break in the policy of both northeast European countries, underlining once again how Vladimir Putin’s aggression has reshaped the post-Cold War order. On Wednesday, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson toured both countries and formalized bilateral security agreements during a whirlwind 24 hours. Johnson said his government would give the countries “whatever is requested” as part of the new pact. Here are some of the issues that have led to the Nordic rethink about entering the 30-nation alliance. The military alliance goes by the acronym of NATO. The North Atlantic Treaty Organisation was formed in 1949 to prevent a resurgence of nationalism and militarism in Europe after two world wars, and to deter the Soviet Union’s expansion. Its membership has swelled to 30 member nations, and over the 1990s and 2000s its enlargement stretched further east to include the former Soviet republics of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. They agree to mutual defense — military action — in response to an enemy attack. The principle goes: “An attack against one ally is considered as an attack against all allies.” This is Article 5 of the NATO constitution. Ukraine is not a member of NATO, which is the main reason why the Western support for Volodymyr Zelenskyy has fallen short of putting their troops on the ground. Ukraine’s admission to NATO has been a stated goal going back to its constitution in 2002, but Ukraine’s president has accepted his country can’t join at present. NATO’s enlargement has been Putin’s biggest publicly stated grievance with the West during the build-up up to war, claiming the eastward expansion and potentially sweeping up the largest other former Soviet republic breaks promises. Adding Sweden and Finland is likely to trigger Putin’s ire too. Moscow has warned it could deploy nuclear weapons and hypersonic missiles in Russia’s Baltic exclave of Kaliningrad — sandwiched between Poland and Lithuania — if they do. NATO has been adamant it will not accept limits on the nations that it admits and has always maintained an “open door policy.” Russia’s invasion of Ukraine pushed Finland and Sweden to the verge of applying for NATO membership, a move that would end staunch military neutrality for the two European nations. Finland, which shares a 1,300-km (810-mile) border with Russia, announced on Thursday that they’re in favor of applying for NATO membership. In a joint statement, the country’s President Sauli Niinisto and Prime Minister Sanna Marin pointed out that “NATO membership would strengthen Finland’s security.” They added that they would apply “without delay” in the next few days, although a few steps remain before the country can become an official part of the alliance. Neighboring Sweden is expected to announce its decision in the coming days. Any applications will usher in a tense wait during the months it takes to be ratified by all NATO members, though the alliance and the White House have said they were confident any security concerns could be addressed in the interim. Both countries have been nonaligned militarily since World War II, but have been edging toward their current position in response to an increasingly belligerent Russia. Finland and Sweden switched from formal neutrality to military nonalignment in 1995 when they joined the European Union, and both have drawn closer to NATO in recent years, exchanging intelligence and participating in alliance exercises. Finland gained independence from Russia in 1917 and fought two wars against it during World War II, where it lost some territory to Moscow. Finland signed an Agreement of Friendship, Cooperation, and Mutual Assistance with Russia in 1948, cementing a degree of economic and political dependency and isolating it militarily from western Europe. The strict policy of neutrality is referred to as “Finlandization.” The end of the Cold War, bringing a break-up of the Soviet Union, allowed Finland to step out of Russia’s shadow as the threat from Moscow diminished. It has relied on its own military deterrence and friendly relations with Moscow to keep the peace. But with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, perceptions of relations with Russia as “friendly” have been undermined. BREAKING: UK Prime Minister @BorisJohnson says Russia's invasion of Ukraine marks the ""end of the post Cold War"" period. It has ""sadly opened a new chapter"". Opinion polls show support for membership in Finland is high, with people mindful of the long land border it shares with Russia. Support in parliament for an application is also broad. Sweden has not fought a war for 200 years and post-war foreign policy has focused on supporting democracy internationally, multilateral dialogue and nuclear disarmament. It ran down its military after the Cold War, cutting defense spending of up to 4% of its GDP to about 1% during the 1990s and early 2000s. Despite Putin’s offensive, many on the left in Sweden remain suspicious of the U.S. security agenda and NATO, which ultimately relies on the deterrence provided by America’s nuclear arsenal. Polls show a substantial majority of Swedes back joining NATO, with support running just above 60% in the latest poll, and there is a majority in parliament in support of an application. Finland has a NATO “option,” a kind of a plan of action that mandates applying if the security situation deteriorates, while Sweden’s parliament will present a new security policy review on Friday, though the latter is not expected to contain an explicit recommendation concerning NATO. Sweden’s ruling Social Democrats have called a parliamentary debate over NATO for Monday. Should the party as expected back joining, the government could call a vote about sending through an application, but it is not formally required to.",29,,,,28

In his latest address, Zelenskyy said the first 10 soldiers have “received the status of suspects” for engaging in what a growing number of leaders are calling war crimes in the Kyiv suburb. The soldiers are from the 64th Motorized Rifle Brigade of the Russian Ground Forces, according to the president. “Their surnames are known. It is established what they did. We know all the details about them and their actions,” Zelenskyy said. “And we will find everyone – just as we will find all the other Russian thugs who killed and tortured Ukrainians, who tormented our people, who destroyed houses and civilian infrastructure in Ukraine. “None of these bastards will avoid responsibility,” he continued. “However, some of them may not survive until trial and fair punishment. But for one reason only – this Russian brigade was relocated to the Kharkiv region. There, they will get retribution from our military.” Zelensky on Biden’s request for $33 billion for Ukraine: “This is a very important step by the United States. And I am grateful to the American people and personally to President Biden for it. I hope that the Congress will quickly support this request for help to our state.”  Russian forces withdrew from Bucha after at least a month of occupation, leaving behind massive bloodshed. Civilians’ bodies were left on the streets, some charred and some bound by hands and legs. Many of the victims were shot execution-style, particularly men. Pets were also killed and left on the street. Ukraine experienced similar horrors in other towns, like Mariupol, Kharkiv, Chernihiv and Irpin. But the documentation of the terror and death in Bucha shocked the world into coming to terms with the level of violence Russia has perpetrated against civilians. Key players in the United Nations Security Council came together on Wednesday to encourage investigations into the atrocities. The informal meeting included the International Criminal Court’s chief prosecutor, the chair of the United Nations Human Rights Council’s Commission of Inquiry, Ukraine’s top prosecutor, and human rights lawyer Amal Clooney. Ukrainian Prosecutor-General Iryna Venediktova has opened over 8,000 investigations into alleged violations of the laws and customs of war, saying “Russia’s actions amount to crimes against humanity and war crimes” and that the pattern “resembles the crime of genocide.” France’s deputy U.N. ambassador and a co-sponsor of the meeting, Nathalie Broadhurst, said the images of the atrocities in Bucha and other places in Ukraine after Russian forces withdrew “are unbearable” and may amount to war crimes. The U.S. has already concluded that Russia committed war crimes in Ukraine. Russia has denied responsibility for any atrocities, repeatedly claiming that its soldiers are simply rooting out neo-Nazis in the smaller country. “The investigation into the crimes committed by the Russian military against our people is underway,” Zelenskyy said. “Ukraine’s position is absolutely clear – every Russian criminal must be and will be brought to justice. Whoever they are and wherever they hide, we will find them all and make them bear responsibility.”",13,,,,5
2022-04-21,HuffPost,https://www.huffpost.com/entry/russia-rape-weapon-of-war-ukraine_n_62617db5e4b0e900dcd34011,Russia Is Using Rape As A Weapon Of War Against Ukraine,"Warning: This article describes graphic sexual violence. Since the war in Ukraine began, reports of sexual violence perpetrated by Russian fighters slowly trickled out of occupied areas. Then, as Russian forces retreated from these regions at the beginning of the month, likely to refocus ground offensive elsewhere, official reports of sexual assault and rape have flooded in. The widespread accounts paint a horrifying picture of how Russian fighters are weaponizing sexual violence and adding to the terror of wartime. The testimonies coming from Ukrainians include gang rapes, assaults taking place at gunpoint, rapes committed in front of victims’ children, as well as torture and mutilation. There have been several reports of Ukrainian women who were raped and then murdered by Russian forces. One Ukrainian woman described on camera how multiple Russian fighters raped her after they rolled into her village with tanks. Another reported that two Russian soldiers murdered her husband on their front lawn and then repeatedly raped her in her basement with her 4-year-old son sobbing in a room down the hall. A group of 15 Ukrainian soldiers, all women, had their heads shaved and were forced to undress and squat for hours while in Russian detention. A dead Ukrainian woman was found in a cellar, shot in the head and naked except for a fur coat, with a used condom and condom wrappers around her. In one of the most abhorrent testimonies, 25 girls and women, ranging from 14 to 24 years old, were locked in a basement and gang-raped repeatedly in Bucha, a city near the capital of Kyiv. Nine of the victims are now pregnant. “Russian soldiers told them they would rape them to the point where they wouldn’t want sexual contact with any man, to prevent them from having Ukrainian children,” said Ukraine’s ombudsman for human rights Lyudmyla Denisova. World leaders have condemned Russia and its president, Vladimir Putin, for the atrocities in Ukraine. President Joe Biden recently called Putin a war criminal, describing the actions of the Russian military as “major war crimes.” U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said earlier this month that the horrors in Bucha were “not the random act of a rogue unit” but a “deliberate campaign to kill, to torture, to rape, to commit atrocities.” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy pleaded for the world to act in a powerful speech to the United Nations Security Council earlier this month. “Women were raped and killed in front of their children. Their tongues were pulled out only because the aggressor did not hear what they wanted to hear from them,” he said after visiting Bucha, which has seen some of the most horrific violence. “Where is the security that the Security Council needs to guarantee? It’s not there. Where is the peace?” Rape has been used as a weapon of war for thousands of years, but it’s not found in every conflict, according to Dara Kay Cohen, a professor of public policy at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard and author of “Rape During Civil War.” For the past decade, Cohen’s work has focused on international relations, civil war and the dynamics of gender and violence in conflicts. The Russia-Ukraine war, however, seems to be ripe for the abuse of sexual violence, Cohen told HuffPost. Ukrainian men ages 18 to 60 were not allowed to leave the country because they will likely be drafted to fight, so the majority of people fleeing the country are women with children and unaccompanied minors. On the other side, about a quarter of the Russian military is made up of conscripts and there have been many reports that a large number of Russian soldiers don’t believe in the cause they’re fighting for. All of this could lead to a perfect storm of sexual violence in conflict. HuffPost spoke with Cohen about how sexual violence is weaponized in conflicts and why armed groups sometimes commit these types of crimes — and what this means in the context of the Russia-Ukraine war. (This interview was edited for brevity and clarity.) How is sexual violence weaponized in conflict zones? There are a huge number of ways that rape is used in wartime. Feminist scholars have argued for a long time about the ways that rape can be used as a form of torture, as a form of humiliation, as a signal that the men of one group can humiliate the men of an enemy group with the message that they can’t protect their women from this terrible violence. It’s been used as a tool of genocide, it’s been used in the context of ethnic wars and non-ethnic wars. But one important point is that rape in wartime is not ubiquitous — it does not happen in every conflict. Even within the context of the same conflict, some armed groups commit sexual violence and other groups do not. One of the keys to understanding why rape happens in wartime is really focusing [on the armed groups themselves] rather than on the region of the world, the country, the level of democracy, etc. All those things might be contributing factors, but what I’ve argued in my research is that the most important part is understanding the armed group that’s committing the sexual violence. What are some indicators that lead you to believe one armed group will commit a higher level of sexual violence than another? One red flag is to look at recent history with these very same military forces. We know … that Russian forces and Russian-backed groups in recent years have committed sexual violence in places like Chechnya, Crimea and in eastern Ukraine. There is a history, a recent history, of this type of violence committed with these same groups. Another red flag is about the composition of the armed groups themselves, the fact that there is conscription. Scholars of civilian victimization and wartime atrocities have found that armed groups that have committed substantial resources to political education use restraint when interacting with civilian populations. Put simply, fighters who know what they’re fighting for or fighters who believe in the cause tend to not abuse civilians to the same extent. We know in Ukraine right now, some Russian fighters have no idea what they’re fighting for and may not believe in the cause very strongly. One of the areas of concern for me and some of my colleagues has been because of what we know about the composition of the Russian forces. Not only are there conscripts, but there also are reports of forced recruitment — literal kidnapping. In other contexts, we have observed those conditions to cause an uptick in sexual violence. Armed groups that recruit their fighters through force are more likely to commit sexual violence. There are also foreign fighters joining the fight in the Ukrainian conflict. That’s another correlate with increased atrocities including increased reports of sexual violence. When there are foreign fighters introduced into someone else’s war, we might expect that these groups suffer from low cohesion. And sexual violence is one consequence of that. “Fighters who believe in the cause tend to not abuse civilians to the same extent. We know in Ukraine right now, some Russian fighters have no idea what they’re fighting for and may not believe in the cause very strongly.” So sexual violence can be a sort of bonding mechanism for fighters in an armed group with low cohesion? That’s correct. There’s a pretty large uptick in reports of multiple perpetrator rape or gang rape, specifically, in the context of wartime. Gang rape is a relatively rare form of sexual violence in peacetime, even in places where rape is quite common. Something like 70% to 80% of reported rape in conflict zones can be gang rape. One of the key factors I found in my research is looking at the function of gang rape, the purpose of gang rape from the perspective of the perpetrating group. I found that gang rape helps armed groups that suffer from low cohesion to essentially overcome that problem. It’s a way of signaling virility and masculinity, which can create social bonds between members of armed groups — particularly members of armed groups that have been forcibly recruited. That sounds relevant to our conversation about the war in Ukraine since about a quarter of the Russian army is made up of conscripts and there have been reports of foreign fighters joining the fight on both sides. There’s a couple of important factors to keep in mind. One is that the people who commit multiple perpetrator rape are, I guess for lack of a better word, more normal or less pathological than people who tend to commit rapes on their own. Many of the contexts I have studied, such as civil wars, these are just ordinary people. These are not criminals. These are not people with a thirst for violence in any way. They’re farmers, they’re students, they’re regular people that have been scooped up by armed groups and beaten and forced to join. It is those same ordinary people who go on to commit these acts of mass rape. There’s a set of studies authored by [Joseph] Vandello on this concept called “precarious manhood.” Vandello and his colleagues argued that if masculinity is threatened, then one way of recovering from the blow of that threat is to perform a physical act, often a violent physical act. In my book, I argue that the act of being forcibly recruited is a major blow to one’s masculinity and one way of recovering that is to perform the ultimate act of physical, hyper-masculine violence: an act of sexualized violence. There have been reports of Russian soldiers using sexual violence as a tool of genocide in Ukraine. Can you talk to me about that? There is evidence that sexual violence has occurred during genocide, although it doesn’t occur during all genocides. We have some examples where sexual contact with the enemy other during a genocide is completely prohibited. It’s not that sexual violence did not occur during the Holocaust, but there were not reports of mass rape or anything close to the levels we knew to happen in other genocides like Rwanda or Bosnia. In the case of the Holocaust, there was a pollution taboo between Jews and Nazis. And, actually, that pollution taboo may have protected folks from being sexually violated. One working hypothesis one of my colleagues [Yale professor] Elisabeth Wood proposed is that rape is actually more likely to occur during a genocide when there was a great deal of intermarriage before the genocide: when there’s close cultural ties between the groups, which seems to be the case in Ukraine and Russia. In the context of genocide, scholars often study what was said to victims and survivors to try to understand the motivations for rape. One of the most concerning reports I believe came out of Bucha where a group of women were [reportedly] held in a basement and raped repeatedly. There were 25 women and girls, and now nine are pregnant. Reports have suggested that the perpetrators told those women things like, “You’ll be raped until no Ukrainian man will want you” or “You’ll be raped so much that we’ll erase the next generation.” That was the implicit — if not explicit — message. Those are all very concerning signs of the genocidal use of sexual violence during conflict. When we discuss rape in wartime, often we only discuss women as victims. Are the majority of victims of sexual violence in conflict zones women? Are there victims of other genders in these situations? That’s a really important question. We know from reports that the majority of victims of sexual violence across conflict contexts are women and girls, but that does not mean that men and boys aren’t also victims of sexual violence. For a long time, scholars approached research on sexual violence assuming that perpetrators are men and victims are women. So, if you wanted to study the question of sexual violence and conflict, you needed to go talk to women. Period. Over time, as we have learned more about how diverse the pools of perpetrators and the pools of victims and survivors are, we’ve gotten much better at asking questions. On a global scale, there are surprisingly large numbers of men and boys who are victimized by sexual violence in contexts of conflict. Really folks of all genders, although there’s diminishingly small evidence because we have a very incomplete evidence base when it comes to LGBTQ+ folks as victims of sexual violence. In some contexts, sexual violence is even more highly stigmatized for men and boys, particularly if the perpetrators are also men. In some contexts, homosexuality is illegal or punishable by death. So, the ability to come forward and report those crimes is really restricted. It’s also the case that in some contexts, rape might be culturally defined as an act of violence that can only happen to women, so even if a man experiences rape it’s not defined as an act of rape. What do we know about what happens to victims in the aftermath of conflict? We know that surviving sexual violence in a conflict is traumatizing. It can have devastating consequences on survivors’ psychological health, on their relationships with their family members, on their relationships with their communities. It can be a terrible and terrifying form of violence to survive. We also know that often it’s not the only thing that a survivor has experienced in conflict. There is a danger in ... assuming it’s the worst thing ... that can happen to a woman in wartime, because that ends up reifying these very patriarchal ideas about women’s sexual purity. It might be the worst thing on the individual level, but we shouldn’t always assume it’s the worst thing. There’s a real concern about creating a hierarchy of harms, as it’s called, and treating sexual violence like it is the ultimate harm that one can suffer. Although women are disproportionately represented among victims of sexual violence, it’s not the case that all women experience sexual violence during conflict, even during mass rape wars. It’s still a relatively rare form of violence compared to forced displacement and other forms of violence that are likely to be much more widespread during conflict. Need help?

The Kremlin has moved the majority of its forces to the east of the country, the Donbas region, but the Ukrainian resistance has been courageously fighting back, as the ministry of defense reported in its Tuesday evening update. The MoD tweeted: “Russia’s ability to progress continues to be impacted by the environmental, logistical and technical challenges that has beset them so far, combined with the resilience of the highly motivated Ukrainian armed forces.” The MoD has previously flagged the declining morale within the Russian ranks, too, stemming from the lack of supplies and personnel. A senior national security official told Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s cabinet on Tuesday that some Russian units were refusing to fight in the war. However, the inability to secure quick victories in Ukraine is likely to make the attacks more aggressive, according to the MoD. The officials tweeted Tuesday: “Russia’s inability to stamp out resistance in Mariupol and their indiscriminate attacks, which have harmed the resident civilian populace are indicative of their continued failure to achieve their aims as quickly as they would like.” For instance, Mariupol, the port town in southeast Ukraine, has been under siege for more than 50 days. But, this could soon change — a marine commander from the region called for help from the international community on Wednesday morning, warning that “the enemy is outnumbering us 10 to one...we have just days or hours left.” Latest Defence Intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine - 19 April 2022 Find out more about the UK government's response: #StandWithUkraine 🇺🇦  Even so, the MoD flags the “resilience of the highly-motivated Ukrainian armed forces” as one of the driving reasons why Russian forces have so far failed in their offensive. The war also seems to have strengthened the west — exactly the opposite of what Putin set out to do. Interim U.S. Ambassador to the U.K., Philip T. Reeker, told Sky News: “Vladimir Putin thought he would find a divided west, a divided alliance, that he would be able to drive wedges. He was sorely mistaken.” He said the NATO alliance is actually stronger than ever now. According to Bloomberg, “More and more top insiders have come to believe that Putin’s commitment to continue the invasion will doom Russia to years of isolation and heightened tension.” The Kremlin insiders, who spoke on condition of anonymity, allegedly fear this will compromise the country’s security, economy and global influence, as the world has reacted in horror at Russia’s alleged attacks on civilians. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has repeatedly warned that this war will scar Russia for years to come, writing on Telegram in his nightly update that the “vileness” of the invasion “will mark the Russian state as a source of absolute evil for generations.” Russian soldiers liberated thousands of Ukrainian homes from:🚽 combat toilets📺 armored TV-sets💻 fighting laptops🎧 tactical earphones👕👟👙 clothes💄 makeup...and thousands of other dangerous NATO items...Let their deeds be forever remembered 🥀🥀  However, Bloomberg adds in its summary: “Many powerful players are too fearful of the widening crackdown on dissent to voice their concerns in public.” Instead, it believes: “Putin is determined to push on with the fight, even if the Kremlin has had to reduce its ambitions from a quick, sweeping takeover of much of the country to a gruelling battle for the Donbas region in the east.”",14,,,,16

With a “significant part of the entire Russian army” now deployed in the region, according to Zelenskyy, here’s what you need to know about what could be a turning point in the conflict. On February 24, Russia invaded neighboring Ukraine. Tanks and soldiers streamed across the border, in scenes more reminiscent of World War II than the remote cyber warfare that modern conflict was supposed to be dominated by. Russia’s invasion has damaged or destroyed up to 30% of Ukraine’s infrastructure at a cost of $100 billion, Ukrainian officials have said, as the United Nations revealed the civilian death toll has now surpassed 2,000. About 4 million Ukrainians have fled the country. But Russia’s swift march to victory did not materialize. Driven back by Ukrainian resistance in the north, Moscow has refocused its ground offensive in the two eastern provinces known as the Donbas, while launching long-distance strikes at other targets including the capital, Kyiv. The Donbas is Ukraine’s mostly Russian-speaking industrial heartland in the east, where Moscow-backed separatists have been fighting Ukrainian forces for the past eight years and have declared two independent republics that have been recognised by Russia. In recent weeks, the Kremlin declared the capture of the Donbas its main goal of the war after its attempt to storm Kyiv failed. After withdrawing from the capital, it began regrouping and reinforcing its ground troops in the east for what could be a climactic battle. On Monday, Ukraine military generals said Russian forces were increasing assaults in the Luhansk and Donetsk regions — both of which are part of the Donbas — as well as in the area of Zaporizhzhia. They also said Russia was sending reinforcements to the Crimean peninsula — seized from Ukraine in 2014 — and to the Rostov-on-Don area, which borders Ukraine. Zelenskyy’s chief of staff Andriy Yermak called it “the second phase of the war” and assured Ukrainians that their forces could hold off the offensive. “Believe in our army, it is very strong,” he said. The Associated Press reported a senior U.S. defense official saying there are now 76 Russian combat units in eastern and southern Ukraine, up from 65 last week. That could translate to around 50,000 to 60,000 troops. ⚡️Foreign minister: Battle of Donbas will be similar to World War II.“This will not be a local operation based on what we see from Russia’s preparations,” Dmytro Kuleba said, adding that he expects large-scale operations involving thousands of tanks, armored vehicles, aircraft. Russia’s stuttering campaign means control of eastern Ukraine has taken added significance, and may prompt the fiercest fighting yet. Russia needs some kind of “win”— recognizing Russia’s claims in the Donbas and Crimea has also been the central plank of Vladamir Putin’s demands at failed peace talks — and following the sinking of its Black Sea lead ship, Putin will not be contemplating further embarrassment. The new offensive in the east came as a Russian missile attack killed seven people in Lviv, the first civilian victims in the western city about 40 miles from Poland. It was one of a multitude of other targets across Ukraine in what appeared to be an intensified bid to grind down the country’s defenses. Lviv has seen only sporadic attacks during almost two months of war and has become a haven for civilians fleeing the fighting elsewhere. Now President Zelensky, in a new public address, says Russia has begun the battle for the Donbas and concentrated a large part of its army there for an all-out offensive in eastern Ukraine.  In other developments, Ukrainian troops remained holed up at a mammoth steel mill in Mariupol, the last known pocket of resistance in the devastated southern port city. The capture of Mariupol, where Ukraine estimates 21,000 people have been killed, is seen as key, and not just because it would deprive Ukraine of a vital port and complete a land bridge between Russia and the Crimean peninsula. General Richard Dannatt, a former head of the British Army, told Sky News that Russia is waging a “softening-up” campaign ahead of the Donbas offensive. The U.S. defense official said that if Russian forces succeed in taking full control of Mariupol, that could free up nearly a dozen combat units for use elsewhere in the Donbas. Given the changing dynamics of the war, Ukraine is calling for an increasing supply of Western weapons. Last week, U.S. President Joe Biden announced an additional $800 million in military assistance to Ukraine, expanding the aid to include heavy artillery ahead of the wider Russian assault expected in eastern Ukraine. The U.S. military expects to start training Ukrainians on using howitzer artillery in coming days, with the training taking place outside Ukraine.

The city of Mariupol has gained international attention in part due to the vast documentation of its nonstop destruction at the hands of the Russian military. The shell of a city appeared on the brink of falling to the Russians on Sunday after Ukrainian defenders did not submit to Moscow’s midday deadline for their surrender, but Shmyhal maintained that the city still belongs to Ukraine. “No, [the] city still has not fallen. There is still our military forces, our soldiers, so they will fight to the end. As for now, they still are in Mariupol,” he told George Stephanopoulos on ABC’s “This Week.” “But there is [a] huge humanitarian catastrophe because there is more than 100 civilians which are suffering for more than 40 days of this humanitarian crisis … in this besieged city,” he continued. “And they have no water, no food, no heat, no electricity. And we ask all of our partners to support and help to stop this humanitarian catastrophe in Mariupol.” Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal tells @GStephanopoulos that the city of Mariupol has not yet fallen to Russian forces because Ukrainian soldiers “will fight till the end.” “But there is a huge humanitarian catastrophe.”  Mariupol has been under relentless attack by Russian forces that pounded most of the buildings and, according to Ukraine, killed at least 21,000 people. Russian military fired a lethal airstrike at a maternity hospital in the first couple of weeks of the invasion, and about 300 Ukrainians were reported killed in a theater where civilians, including children, were taking shelter. The city was home to about 450,000 before Russia invaded. An estimated 100,000 now remain, according to The Associated Press. The Russian military claims that about 2,500 Ukrainian fighters are holding out at a steel plant in the last pocket of resistance in Mariupol. That claim could not be independently verified. This is “what the Russian Federation did, deliberately did. And deliberately continues to destroy cities. Russia is deliberately trying to destroy everyone who is there in Mariupol,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Saturday in a virtual address, adding that the situation in the port city remains as “severe as possible” and that the devastation is “just inhuman.” Capturing Mariupol would be Russian President Vladimir Putin’s biggest victory in Ukraine after two months of costly fighting, major military deaths and forced withdrawal from some cities, as well as a worsening economy in Russia from increasing Western sanctions. The nuclear superpower also recently faced the humiliating loss of the flagship of its Black Sea Fleet to what Ukraine claimed was a missile attack. Russia’s potential seizure of Mariupol would allow Putin to secure a land corridor to the Crimean Peninsula — which it annexed from Ukraine in 2014 — and deprive the smaller country of a major port. The seizure would also allow more Russian troops to be available for the offensive on the east. Shmyhal said Sunday that Ukraine will try to stop the war “in any way,” including diplomatically when possible. But if Russians refuse to negotiate in good faith, “we will fight to the end, absolutely.” “We will not surrender. We won’t leave our country, our families, our land,” he continued. “So we will fight absolutely to the end, to win in this war.”",17,,,,15

They just killed people, not soldiers. People. They just shot people in the streets,” he told CNN’s Jake Tapper of the numerous atrocities seen throughout the country since the start of Russia’s invasion, while highlighting the slaughter of people in Bucha, a suburb of Kyiv, in particular. “These were not soldiers; they were civilians. They bound their hands; they forced children to watch as they raped their mothers; then they threw them in a well or in mass graves. Children, adults, the elderly. And we have substantial evidence that points to this being a genocide, audio and video where they talk about just how much they hate us,” he said in an interview that aired in full Sunday. Ukrainian President Volodymyr @ZelenskyyUa tells CNN's @jaketapper that his country has ""substantial evidence"" that Russia is committing genocide. #CNNSOTU  Video and satellite images taken in Bucha in recent weeks show bodies lining the streets while Russia’s military was in control of the region, rebutting Russia’s claim that the bodies had been placed there after its military left. Some of the bodies were seen with their hands bound behind their backs and gunshot wounds to the head. Zelenskyy, a father of two, expressed particular heartbreak over a recent video circulating that shows a mother finding her child’s body down a well in the village of Buzova near Kyiv. He called the video “the most horrifying thing I have seen in my life.” “I can’t watch it as a father, only because all you want after this is revenge and to kill. I have to watch it as the president of a state where a lot of people have died and lost their loved ones,” he said. “And there are millions of people who want to live. All of us want to fight. But we all have to do our best for this war not to be endless. The longer it is, the more we would lose.” He further shared his belief that the violence could escalate beyond Ukraine’s borders, stressing that Russia could use chemical or nuclear weapons and the rest of the world should “be ready.” “For them, life of the people is nothing,” he said. President Joe Biden on Tuesday also said he believes the killings in Ukraine are genocide but that he will “let the lawyers decide, internationally, whether or not it qualifies.” French President Emmanuel Macron, who has engaged in diplomatic discussions with Russian President Vladimir Putin since the start of the war, has meanwhile stopped short of using such a label, saying an “escalation of words” won’t bring peace. Zelenskyy said he has addressed Macron directly about that opinion and has invited the French leader, as well as Biden, to visit Ukraine to see the death and destruction firsthand. “He’ll come and see, and I am sure he will understand,” Zelenskyy said of Macron. Genocide is a crime recognized under international law as an act that intends “to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group,” according to the Genocide Convention, which was ratified by the U.S. in 1988. The U.S. has recognized genocide only eight times since the Holocaust, with the government most recently in March accusing Myanmar of committing genocide against its minority Rohingya population. That recognition came nearly five years after the peak of the violence and follows similar recognitions by other countries, including Canada, France and Turkey.",13,,,,0

He pointed to the horrifying tragedy to again plead for the international community to give Ukraine “all necessary heavy weapons” and planes “immediately” to defend itself against the brutal invading forces. “I want to be heard right now: There has not been a single day since the blockade of Mariupol that we have not sought a solution — military or diplomatic, anything to save people. But finding this solution is extremely difficult. So far, there is no 100% valid option,” Zelenskyy said. Russia’s defense ministry claimed on Saturday that beyond a small Ukrainian group of fighters still left, Russian forces had “completely cleared” Mariupol.

Finnish Prime Minister Sanna Marin said Wednesday that her country would decide whether to join the seven-decade-old military alliance within “weeks.” Her party has already begun weighing the pros and cons of applying. Marin was joined at a news conference by her Swedish counterpart, Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson. Both Nordic leaders said Russia’s Ukraine invasion had changed how they think about their national security. “The European security architecture has changed fundamentally after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine,” Marin said. “There is a before and after 24th of February,” Andersson added, referencing the first day of the invasion. “The security landscape has completely changed.” A larger NATO is exactly what Russian President Vladimir Putin did not want, and the Kremlin has warned both nations against joining the alliance.

Biden later doubled down on his comments in remarks to reporters, saying lawyers would decide whether Russia’s actions meet the international definition of genocide, “but it sure seems that way to me.” “Yes, I called it genocide — it’s become clearer and clearer that Putin is just trying to wipe out the idea of even being a Ukrainian,” he added. Previously, the president had condemned the Kremlin’s attacks on Ukraine by saying Putin was a “war criminal” and should face a trial for war crimes. The United Nations defines genocide as killing or causing serious harm to a group — national, ethnic, racial or religious — with the intent to destroy the group in whole or in part. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who had previously described Russia’s actions as genocide, responded to Biden’s remarks on Twitter: “Calling things by their names is essential to stand up to evil.” He added that Ukrainians “urgently need more heavy weapons to prevent further Russian atrocities.” Since Russia began its attack on Ukraine in late February, the U.N. has tracked nearly 2,000 deaths and over 2,500 injuries, noting the actual numbers are likely “considerably higher,” with reports of mass deaths in some areas, including Mariupol, still to be confirmed. Mariupol’s mayor said this week that over 10,000 civilians in his city have died in Russian attacks. Over 4 million Ukrainians have fled their country due to the violence. Earlier this week, Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) said Russia’s brutal attack “clearly is genocide.”",13,,,,29

Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) said Sunday that Russia’s brutal attacks on Ukraine constitute genocide, a term the White House has so far avoided using when talking about the war. Cheney appeared on CNN’s “State of the Union,” where she spoke with host Jake Tapper about the mass killing of Ukrainian civilians since Russia invaded the neighboring country. “I think this clearly is genocide. I think that you asked exactly the right questions,” she told Tapper. “I think that Europe needs to understand and grapple with the fact that you’ve got a genocidal campaign ― the first kind of horrific genocidal campaign that we have seen certainly in recent decades.” ""I think this is clearly a genocide.""CNN's @jaketapper asks Rep. Liz Cheney (R-WY) about a missile strike on a Ukrainian train station that left dozens dead and how she thinks European allies should respond. #CNNSOTU @CNNSotu  Article II of the United Nations Genocide Convention defines genocide as “any of the following acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group” ― followed by a list of actions such as “killing members of the group,” “imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group,” “forcibly transferring children of the group to another group,” and deliberately inflicting “conditions of life” meant to bring about the group’s physical destruction. The U.N. treaty has been criticized since its 1948 adoption, both by those who feel its definition of genocide is too narrow and others who believe the term can be applied to too many situations. As defined by the treaty, the most recent act of genocide took place in 1994 in Rwanda. The International Criminal Court, however, issued an arrest warrant for Sudan’s president in 2010 on genocide charges; the U.S. in 2016 accused the Islamic State of genocide in Iraq and Syria; Gambia submitted a case to the International Court of Justice in 2017 accusing of Myanmar of genocide against Rohingyas; and several nations formally accused China last year of genocide against the Uyghurs in Xinjiang. Ukrainian officials, including President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, have described Russia’s attacks on civilians as a genocide ― raising comparisons to the horrors of the Holodomor, where millions of Ukrainians died of a famine engineered by the Soviet government in 1932. The International Criminal Court’s prosecutor is currently conducting an investigation on the atrocities stemming from the Russian invasion. Though White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan was comfortable saying Russia’s actions constitute war crimes, he hesitated on Sunday to describe the attacks as genocide. “Look, in my opinion, the label is less important than the fact that these acts are cruel and criminal and wrong and evil and need to be responded to decisively. And that is what we are doing,” Sullivan told Tapper. “And we’re doing that not just by supporting international investigations and gathering evidence to hold the perpetrators all the way to the highest levels accountable. We’re doing it by providing sophisticated weapons to the Ukrainians that are making a major difference on the battlefield.” Congress voted on Thursday to suspend normal trade relations with Russia and to ban oil imports, while the European Union approved an embargo on coal imports. The U.N. General Assembly voted to suspend Russia from its Human Rights Council. Sullivan pointed out that banning oil imports is harder for European countries that are much more reliant on Russian energy. The U.S. is “surging exports of U.S. liquefied natural gas to Europe” so other countries can wean off Russian oil and gas. Cheney said Sunday that European nations need to pull the plug on Russian imports if they truly support Ukraine in the war. “Europeans need to understand that they’re funding that genocidal campaign,” she told Tapper. “I understand the economic consequences to countries in Western Europe, if they were to impose the kind of oil and gas embargo that the U.S. has imposed against Russian oil and gas, but they need to do it. And we need to do everything we can to increase our own domestic production, to help make sure that we can supply them with as much as possible.” “But they need to understand that every single time, every single day that they are continuing to import Russian oil and gas,” she went on, “they’re funding Putin’s genocide in Ukraine.”",13,,,,21

Stoltenberg, in an interview published Saturday in The Telegraph, said military commanders for NATO’s 30 member countries are preparing a “reset” of the alliance that must include an increase in national defense spending in order to ward off future threats. Some members still do not meet the alliance’s guideline on defense spending. Members are instructed to allocate at least 2% of their gross domestic product to defense. “We have to ensure that we continue to be able, in a more dangerous world, to protect and defend all NATO allies,” Stoltenberg said. The secretary-general described NATO’s previous presence along the border ― prior to the start of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February ― as a mere “tripwire” that was more symbolic of the alliance’s unity than anything. It was not designed to repel an invasion. “Regardless of when, how, the war in Ukraine ends, the war has already had long-term consequences for our security,” he said. “NATO needs to adapt to that new reality. And that’s exactly what we are doing.” Stoltenberg said NATO will adopt a new Strategic Concept document in June at the 2022 Madrid Summit. This formal strategy document will not only outline NATO’s defense efforts against Russia, but for the first time is expected to mention China as a growing threat. “I expect China to be an important part.

Civilians in towns and villages from Kherson in the south to Izyum in the east are grappling with crackdowns and, evidence suggests, horrifying war crimes perpetrated by Russian soldiers. Ukrainians living in Russian-controlled areas are also doing something else: resisting. Ukraine’s military is leading the country’s effort to vanquish Russian President Vladimir Putin’s forces, which invaded in late February. The U.S. and allies from Europe to the Pacific are funneling arms and sophisticated equipment to these troops. But Ukrainian civilians are stepping up, too. With little support and training, ordinary people in war-torn, occupied areas are undermining Russia, supporting their country’s counter-offensives, and fueling unity among Ukrainians and international concern for their nation. “There’s no way to over-exaggerate the extreme bravery that these ordinary citizens are demonstrating,” said Olga Onuch, an associate professor at the University of Manchester. The civilian resistance to Russia is using time-honored tactics, like daily demonstrations, and foiling occupiers’ plans to consolidate their rule by refusing to cooperate. The resistance is also developing covert, informal efforts to ease humanitarian suffering and hurt Russia’s military capabilities by gathering intelligence and training citizens in small-scale guerilla tactics. The choices of everyday people can have huge implications for a campaign like the Russian mission, which depends on controlling strategic population centers and challenging a national identity, military experts say. Russia wants the world to believe Ukrainians want its incursion; their resistance proves otherwise. Some of the most important flashpoints in the conflict in the weeks ahead are connected to occupied towns. Moscow is now focusing on eastern Ukraine, according to national security analysts and Russian leaders. Russia’s forces seek to hold Izyum, a city they captured on Friday that was once home to 40,000 people, and to conquer the nearby city of Slovyansk. If the Ukrainians can thwart that plan, they might quash Russia’s hope of cutting off Ukrainian troops in the country’s eastern regions from reinforcements and supplies. And in the south, Ukrainians are defying Russia in towns like Melitopol, Enerhodar and Kherson — areas that are integral to Russia’s attempt to limit Ukraine’s access to its coasts, seize the Ukrainian ports of Mykolaiv and Odesa and establish a land corridor between Russian territory and Crimea, the Ukrainian peninsula that Russia took over in 2014. “While Ukraine’s armed forces are proving themselves capable, no resistance can succeed without an effective auxiliary [of citizens in occupied areas] and underground. The civil element will be essential in the current conflict,” Walter Haynes, a U.S. Army major, recently wrote in an essay for the blog War on the Rocks. In March, Kherson became the first large Ukrainian city to fall to Russia. Its residents immediately began protesting against their new rulers, with hundreds gathering in large groups to chant and wave Ukrainian flags. A week later, even bigger crowds demonstrated in occupied Melitopol after Russian soldiers detained the city’s mayor. ""They’re distinctly peaceful — by using the [Ukrainian] national symbols, people are trying to intervene in Putin’s narrative that they would like to be part of Russia or that they don’t have their own state,” said Olga Boichak, a lecturer in digital cultures at the University of Sydney. “Russian media is portraying Ukraine as a failed state, a non-entity. What people are doing is directly contradicting that and showing it is not true.” Onuch said mass protests are common in Ukrainian history and that citizens know to gather in large main squares near government buildings. Their rallies usually include a diverse sample of the local population: “We can look at the images … it’s not all young people, it’s not all men,” she said. Two female journalists in Kherson are documenting developments in the city in weekly dispatches for The Guardian (which is protecting their identities), and other locals are raising the alarm about growing problems like shortages of medical supplies. Through nonviolent methods, Ukrainians hope to prove that Russian control over captured territory is not sustainable. Some who speak Russian are trying to build a rapport with Russian soldiers to humanize Ukrainians, said Marta Kepe, a senior defense analyst at the RAND Corporation. Melitopol’s mayor, Ivan Federov, challenged the troops who detained him, saying Moscow misled them by claiming that Ukraine hosted Nazis and disrespected World War II veterans. Other Ukrainians are deploying their language skills to demoralize the Russians, telling them they will die in a foreign country or suggesting that food they find in abandoned homes has been poisoned. Consistent, public resistance in cities like Kherson makes it hard for Putin to stage dubious local elections and claim popular support for Russian meddling in Ukraine, as he has elsewhere in the country, Kepe noted. “Russia wants the world to believe Ukrainians want its incursion; their resistance proves otherwise.” Meanwhile, Russian officials are doing little to build trust or sympathy among Ukrainian civilians. In Kherson, Russians are detaining people in a secret prison and have set up roadblocks that make it impossible for civilians to even visit their loved ones’ graves, according to Elena Kostyuchenko, a respected Russian journalist who traveled to the town for the independent news outlet Novaya Gazeta. She observed Ukrainians refusing Russian aid and spoke with a local reporter who was kidnapped, beaten and interrogated about who was organizing the pro-Ukraine rallies — treatment that a contact of a local correspondent for The Guardian also experienced. (Russian authorities have since forced Novaya Gazeta to remove Kostyuchenko’s article.) Because Russia’s troops mismanaged their supply lines and became desperate for provisions, “looting became endemic” as they advanced through Ukraine, “increasing soldier-civilian contact in all kinds of disastrous ways,” Jason Lyall, a Dartmouth University professor, wrote on Twitter. “Savagery is a function of how the army was recruited, equipped, and deployed.” On April 3, Human Rights Watch released evidence that Russian forces in occupied Ukrainian areas had committed war crimes, including repeated rape, summary executions and theft. Residents of a recently occupied village in northern Ukraine also told The Washington Post a Russian commander subjected them to beatings and mock executions, attacking them in retaliation for Russian battlefield losses and massacring their livestock. Moscow seems set on “trying to achieve compliance through intimidation,” Kepe said. But Russia’s repression is backfiring, sparking more Ukrainian outrage, Kepe and other analysts believe. The nature of the resistance makes it hard for the occupying troops to wipe it out. When the Russians have targeted infrastructure like TV and radio stations in the occupied regions, Ukrainians have turned to shortwave radio, Kepe said. Much of the organizing relies on internet communications like the Telegram platform, which Russia has not been able to cut off. Volunteers quietly work to help fellow Ukrainians access electricity and inform each other of where supplies can be found. The movement is “virtually leaderless,” Boichak said, so if Russian troops try to suppress protests by targeting a few prominent individuals, others are likely to immediately replace them. Russia’s military is willing to escalate, as soldiers showed in Kherson when they used grenades and gunfire to displace rallies. Still, Ukrainians participating in the resistance take brutality as a given, Onuch said: “No one is under any illusion that this is safe.” In resisting Russia day to day, Ukrainians in occupied territories are preparing for a bigger future clash: the battle to liberate their homes. “They are starving, with no electricity, no utilities … and they are waiting for the Ukrainian armed forces. They would like to be released,” Mariia Ionova, a member of Ukraine’s Parliament, told HuffPost. Civilians have shaped the fighting in Ukraine since it began, slowing the Russian advance by tearing down or altering road signs and blocking military convoys with sandbags, crates and even their own bodies. Living under Russian occupation, regular citizens can aid Ukrainian counter-offensives by keeping communities in contact with the Kyiv government, sharing information about Russian logistics and ground conditions, and developing their own fighting and medical capabilities, according to the U.S. Army’s Haynes. (He published his essay on Ukrainian civil resistance in a personal capacity.) Civilians can also help Ukraine recapture cities by discouraging collaboration between locals and the occupying troops, Haynes continued. Scott Boston, a senior defense analyst at the RAND Corporation, told HuffPost that Russian intelligence initially failed to identify sympathetic Ukrainians in captured areas. As Ukrainians have publicized civil resistance and military victories, public collaboration with Russia is now even less likely, Boston said. When battles over occupied areas occur, civilians can use secure communications to keep fellow noncombatants safe, he added. And they can use advice from fellow civilians and Ukrainian authorities to wear down Russian troops, Boichak of the University of Sydney said: creating homemade Molotov cocktails, disarming military vehicles or using whatever they have at their disposal — the way one Ukrainian woman destroyed a Russian drone with a jar of pickled tomatoes. Boichak noted the morale-boosting impact of Ukraine’s military sharing stories of villagers gathering with shovels to dig trenches. “A lot of it is like that: this understanding that everyone is in it … not everyone needs to be at the battlefront,” she said. Ukrainians have a recent model for developing a resistance that foils Russia’s aims. In Mariupol, the port city that Putin is now pummeling, Russian-backed militias previously attempted a takeover in the spring of 2014. Activists began organizing small pro-Ukraine rallies and used social media to dispel Russian propaganda, post updates about city life and rally like-minded citizens, most of whom spoke Russian but were convinced of the importance of Ukrainian independence. “That [support] was driven by a sense of Ukrainian national identity as a civic category, not in an ethnonationalist sense” Boichak said. A month into the occupation, thousands of steelworkers joined police patrols to prevent pro-Russian fighters from establishing an alternative government. And not long afterward, Ukrainian forces reclaimed the city. Today, regaining occupied territory is a top priority for Ukraine, parliamentarian Ivanna Klympush-Tsintsadze told HuffPost. Anastasia Radina, a fellow lawmaker, said the best way to help people demonstrating against Russia was for Kyiv to deploy advanced equipment like aircraft from other governments. As the war’s trajectory shifts, civilians are making clear that the conflict is about more than military plans — and that they are more than victims. “The tragedy of this whole thing is that the Russians miscalculate Ukrainians, the West miscalculates Ukrainians and Ukrainians are using the only tool at their disposal, which is going out on the street and showing that they are wholeheartedly against this occupation,” said Onuch, of Manchester University. “Ordinary people that do extraordinary things always take our breath away.”",14,,,,20

In a Twitter post shared Thursday morning, the ministry of defense explained how the Russians have shifted their lines of attack. It wrote: “Progressing offensive operations in eastern Ukraine is the main focus of Russian military forces. “Russian artillery and air strikes continue along the Donbas line of control.” The Donbas region is in eastern Ukraine, and encapsulates Donetsk and Luhansk — areas partially occupied by pro-Russian rebels since the annexation of Crimea back in 2014. This renewed focus on the east comes after troops withdrew from the Kyiv region — leading to the discovery of the Bucha massacre. The U.K. officials also pointed out that Russian forces are trying to impact Ukrainian supplies. “Russian strikes against infrastructure targets within the Ukrainian interior are likely intended to degrade the ability of the Ukrainian military to resupply and increase pressure on the Ukrainian government.” However, the intelligence suggests that actually it is the Russians who are facing supply shortages – along with a lack of morale among its dwindling workforce. The ministry of defense tweeted: “Despite refocusing forces and logistics capabilities to support operations in the Donbas, Russian forces are likely to continue facing morale issues and shortages of supplies and personnel.” Latest Defence Intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine - 7 April 2022 Find out more about the UK government's response: #StandWithUkraine 🇺🇦  Russian losses are certainly high. At the end of last month, NATO estimated that up to 40,000 soldiers had been killed, wounded, captured or missing in action. This number is expected to have increased in April as Ukrainians managed to push the Russians out of various cities, including Kyiv and Kharkiv. Pentagon Press Secretary John Kirby went even further than the ministry of defense, and expressed his belief that the Ukrainian troops can win the war this week. He told reporters on Wednesday: “Mr Putin has achieved exactly zero of his objectives inside Ukraine. “He didn’t take Kyiv. He didn’t topple the government. He didn’t remove Ukraine as a nation state. “And, he’s really only taken control of a small number of population centers and even those weren’t the ones he was really going after.” He pointed out even Mariupol has not been taken – “the proof is literally in the outcomes you are seeing every day.” Mr Putin has achieved exactly zero of his objectives inside Ukraine. He didn’t take Kyiv. He didn’t topple the government. He didn’t remove Ukraine as a nation state.  Yet, a previous update from the Ministry of Defense, posted on Wednesday, explained that Ukrainians are still suffering, significantly, despite their various successes. For instance, Mariupol, the coastal city in the east of Ukraine, is now under siege as the Russians attempt to cut off their links to the outside world. “The humanitarian situation in the city [of Mariupol] is worsening,” officials explained. “Most of the 160,000 remaining residents have no light, communication, medicine, heat or water. “Russian forces have prevented humanitarian access, likely to pressure defenders to surrender.”",14,,,,22

The reports are consistent with claims by the Mariupol City Council that Russians have kidnapped 20,000 Mariupol residents, according to an English translation of a March 29 post on the council’s Telegram channel. Russian soldiers have transported Ukrainians, including patients and staff from at least two Mariupol maternity hospitals, through Russian-controlled parts of eastern Ukraine, NPR reported. The woman told The Guardian she was among a group of roughly 200 to 300 people who were taken to Novoazovsk, Ukraine, via bus. That’s when they recognized they had arrived at a “filtration camp,” a series of military tents run by the Russian military where those arriving faced interrogation and confiscation of personal items before they were eventually moved to Russia. The woman said she had her photo and fingerprints taken, and was questioned about potential ties to the Ukrainian military and her opinion on the war before being sent to the Russian town of Rostov. Others have reported they had to hand in their phones and passwords, which officers then used to access their phone contacts and register them into a database, according to The Washington Post. The woman left the group after telling the soldiers she had family in the area and has since made her way to the E.U. “Such reports are lies,” said Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov. Unlawful deportations constitute war crimes, according to the United Nations. President Joe Biden said Putin is a “war criminal” and should face trial, pledging additional sanctions following atrocities documented in Bucha. Moscow said in March it rescued 420,000 people “from dangerous regions of Ukraine, the Donetsk and Luhansk People’s Republics” and evacuated them to Russia. U.S. intelligence warned before the invasion that Russia may resort to its past practices of unlawful detentions. “These acts, which in past Russian operations have included targeted killings, kidnappings/forced disappearances, unjust detentions, and the use of torture, would likely target those who oppose Russian actions,” Bathsheba Crocker, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, wrote in a letter to the U.N. The term “filtration camps” originated in the Soviet Union at the end of World War II. Soviet citizens that had been living outside the country who then sought to return — even those forcibly taken to Germany as war criminals — were deemed “suspect.” They had to be screened in camps and holding stations before they were readmitted into the Soviet Union or deported, according to U.K. history professor Nick Baron. In February 2000, Human Rights Watch issued a report detailing excessive violence and rape committed by Russian forces inside a filtration camp in Chechnya, following a 1999 offensive against Chechen rebels during Putin’s first month in power. The aggression offset an earlier Russian setback that forced Russia to remove its forces from the region and sign a treaty that gave Chechnya, a majority Muslim republic, large autonomy in 1996, according to NPR. Russia emerged triumphant this time, with Putin celebrating his victory in March 2000. The ongoing Ukraine war has worried those who have followed Chechnya. “There are some pretty disturbing parallels,” Thomas de Waal, a journalist who covered the area in the 1990s, told NPR. “The use of heavy artillery, the indiscriminate attacking of an urban center. They bring back some pretty terrible memories for those of us who covered the Chechnya war of the 1990s.” The southern port city of Mariupol, where those taken to filtration camps originated, has borne the brunt of Russian cruelty and faces continued bombardments.

Ukrainian authorities and journalists have seen evidence of widespread civilian casualties in Bucha, a suburban area northwest of Kyiv. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken described the casualties as evidence of “a deliberate campaign to kill, to torture, to rape” ― not “the random act of a rogue unit.” President Joe Biden on Monday called for Russian President Vladimir Putin to be held accountable for the violence, which he described as a war crime. Russia has repeatedly asserted that the violence was committed after its forces left the region. Blinken, however, said Tuesday that reports of atrocities committed by the Russians are “more than credible.” “I’m addressing you on behalf of the memory of the deceased,” Zelenskyy told the U.N. council. “They died suffering.” He alleged that Russian troops searched for and killed “anyone who served our country,” including entire families, executing many people in the street. Other people were thrown in wells, Zelenskyy claimed, and some had their limbs or tongues removed. Photographs showed that some of the dead had their hands tied behind their backs. The world has yet to see the full extent of the brutality, Zelenskyy added. The Russians’ behavior is “no different than ISIS,” Zelenskyy said. “And here it is done by a member of the United Nations Security Council.” The Ukrainian leader condemned the group, whose permanent members include the Russian Federation, for not doing more to end the conflict. He proposed three options: Remove Russia from the security council, reform the council, or dissolve it completely. Citing what he called Ukraine’s “moral right” to propose reforms, Zelenskyy argued that Russia’s veto power makes the council worthless in fulfilling its main purpose of peacekeeping. There is currently no process for removing a member of the security council. “Accountability must be inevitable,” Zelenskyy said. The Ukrainian delegation sent a video to be played following the president’s remarks, but technical issues prevented it from being shown immediately afterward. U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield subsequently announced that the U.S. would seek to suspend Russia from the United Nations Human Rights Council, noting that Russia has used false allegations of human rights abuses on the part of Ukraine to justify its invasion.",13,,,,29

See what bastards you’ve raised,” Zelenskyy posted on his Telegram channel. “Murderers, looters, butchers.” Some of the graphic scenes the president was referring to are shown below. Such photos and videos have been coming out of cities like Bucha and the Kyiv suburbs of Irpin and Hostomel, which Zelenskyy adviser Oleksiy Arestovych said looked like a “scene from a horror movie.” Ukrainian troops have discovered brutalized bodies and widespread destruction in the area outside the capital. Authorities said they are documenting evidence as Ukraine’s military reclaims territory and Russian soldiers withdraw to focus on targeting fuel and ammunition supplies in southern and eastern Ukraine. Graphic photos from Bucha showed bodies in the streets, some that Associated Press journalists in the area noted had their hands tied behind their backs and had been killed at what appeared to be close range. Other bodies were found wrapped in plastic, bound with tape and tossed in a ditch. Arestovych said some civilians were shot in the head, and some bodies showed signs of torture, rape and burning. Zelenskyy on Sunday also slammed NATO for not inviting Ukraine to accession talks in 2008. During the alliance’s summit that year in Bucharest, Romania, members invited Albania and Croatia to accession talks with NATO. “The many years of hard work within the Membership Action Plan have paid off,” the NATO secretary-general said at the summit. “Due to your hard work, Allies can be confident that your admission to the Alliance will strengthen NATO.” The alliance was also tasked with deciding whether to provide Georgia and Ukraine with MAP status. Neither nation received such status, and they were left with an open-ended promise of eventual, potential membership. “Bucharest, NATO Summit Declaration. April 3, 14 years ago. There was a chance to prevent, so that Russia did not come,” Zelenskyy wrote in the same Telegram post on Sunday. “Bucha, Kyiv region. Now. Russia has come.” U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken was asked on Sunday about the prospect of guaranteeing security to Ukraine should the country commit to neutrality as part of a negotiation with Russia to end the war. “All of this is up to the Ukrainians, which is to say that, if they negotiate something that meets their needs, that preserves their sovereignty, their independence, we will back it,” Blinken told CNN’s “State of the Union.” “And we’re not going to be less Ukrainian than Ukrainians. We’re not going to be more Ukrainian than Ukrainians. So, first and foremost, it’s up to them, to their elected representatives, to President Zelenskyy. “When it comes to the future, we and allies and partners are going to want to make sure that we do everything we can to ensure that this can’t happen again and that Ukraine has the means to defend itself, to deter the Russian aggression,” he continued. “So, we will look at anything that we can do to back up that kind of outcome.”",29,,,,9

Although the devastating attacks on Ukraine continue, there is a general consensus that the war has not exactly gone according to the Russian president’s plan and troops have moved back from the capital of Kyiv. Here’s what officials from the U.K. and the U.S. have said about Russia’s efforts: U.K. Defense Secretary Ben Wallace ripped into Putin over his military failures in Ukraine on Thursday, and declared that the Russian president is now caught “in a cage he built himself.” Wallace told Sky News: “President Putin is not the force he used to be. “He is now a man in a cage he built himself. His army is exhausted, he has suffered significant losses. “The reputation of this great army of Russia has been trashed. “He has not only got to live with the consequences of what he is doing to Ukraine, but he has also got to live with consequences of what he has done to his own army. “We have seen it before. It always get worse. It goes for more civilian attacks, more civilian areas.” Russia has repeatedly denied that it is attacking civilian areas as part of its “special military operation” in Ukraine, despite evidence that bomb shelters and maternity hospitals have been targeted. 'President Putin must recognise that his three or four-day plan is now in day 36"".Defence Secretary Ben Wallace says Russia's invasion of Ukraine is ""definitely not going to plan"". Sky 501, Virgin 602, Freeview 233 and YouTube  Admiral Sir Tony Radakin, the U.K.’s chief of defense staff, expressed a similar point of view when he said Russia’s attempts to seize the whole of Ukraine have “fallen apart.” Speaking at an Institute for Government event on Thursday, he said that Putin was a “weaker and more diminished figure” than he was prior to the invasion — while “NATO is stronger and more united today than at any time I can remember.” He also alleged that Putin had been “misled” about how effective his forces were amid reports that Russia is withdrawing from Ukraine. Some Kremlin aides are allegedly too afraid to tell the president how the invasion is actually going, although Moscow has denied this charge. Radakin also said that the Kremlin appeared to be moving the emphasis onto the east and south of Ukraine, but predicted: “Ukraine armed forces will attack those Russian forces as they retreat.” He also said: “In many ways, Putin has already lost. Far from being the far-sighted manipulator of events that he would have us believe, Putin has damaged himself through a series of catastrophic misjudgements. “Like all authoritarians, he allowed himself to be misled as to his own strength, including the effectiveness of the Russian armed forces.” Sir Jeremy Fleming, head of GCHQ intelligence agency, shared a similar warning Wednesday. He said: “Even though we believe Putin’s advisers are afraid to tell him the truth, what’s going on and the extent of these misjudgements must be crystal clear to the regime.” On Thursday night, the ministry of defense tweeted that Russia is now redeploying elements of its military forces from Georgia. It claimed: “It is highly unlikely that Russia planned to generate reinforcements in this manner and it is indicative of the unexpected losses it has sustained during the invasion.” Latest Defence Intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine - 31 March 2022 Find out more about the UK government's response: #StandWithUkraine 🇺🇦  The Kyiv Independent shared the Ukraine’s Armed Forces estimates when it comes to what Russia has lost since the war began on February 24. Approximately, 17,700 troops have been lost, along with 1,220 vehicles, and 1,751 armoured personnel carriers. The newspaper’s defense reporter Illia Ponomarenko also tweeted: “Russians basically came to Kyiv with an unbelievably stupid and unrealistic plan, killed a lot of people, ruined a lot of homes, and sustained heavy casualties.

In the U.S., the White House claimed there has been “incontrovertible evidence” that the war on Ukraine has “been a strategic disaster for Russia” on Thursday. U.S. President Joe Biden’s communications director Kate Bedingfield told the press that Russia was trying to “redefine the initial aims of their invasion” as a result. She continued: “We have information that Putin felt misled by the Russian military, which has resulted in persistent tension between Putin and his military leadership.” She also pointed out that it is becoming clearer Putin’s war will leave Russia “isolated on the world stage.”",14,,,,11

That evening, Natalya — the pseudonym she used in the interview published Monday — said her husband went out to check their front yard after hearing noise. A few moments later she said she heard a gunshot. “I cried out, where is my husband, then I looked outside and I saw him on the ground by the gate,” she told The Times of London. “This younger guy pulled gun to my head and said: ‘I shot your husband because he’s a Nazi.’” Then, she said, the two soldiers proceeded to repeatedly rape her, while her son was weeping in a nearby room. Natalya said she recognized one of the two men on social media. This case will be the subject of an investigation — the first official look into sexual violence allegations against Russian forces, according to The Times of London — which was previewed by Ukraine’s prosecutor general Iryna Venediktova on Facebook last week. Moscow is contesting the allegations in Venediktova’s post. “It is a lie,” Dmitry Peskov, the Kremlin’s press secretary, told reporters last week, according to an Interfax news agency report cited by The New York Times. Natalya and her son Oleksii — also a pseudonym — eventually made it to Ternopil, near Lviv in western Ukraine, where her husband’s sister was staying. She said her husband’s sister encouraged her to break her silence over the violence she endured. “I could have been silent but when we got to the police my husband’s sister made me speak up and there was no going back,” she said. “I understand that many people who have been hurt would stay silent because they are afraid. Lots of people don’t believe terrible things like this happen.” A United Nations resolution brought forward by then-U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice in 2008 and adopted that year declared that rape and other forms of sexual violence can be considered war crimes. Maria Mezentseva, a member of Ukraine’s parliament, told Sky News on Sunday that her country will be seeking expertise from the U.K. to support survivors. “There are many more victims rather than just this one case which has been made public by the prosecutor general,” she said. “And of course, we are expecting many more of them, which will be public once victims will be ready to talk about them.” What's happening to women in Ukraine is ""quite a scary scene"", says @mezentseva_dep as she recalls an incident where a woman was ""raped several times in front of her underage child"" after her husband was shot.#Ridge: 501, Virgin 602, Freeview 233  Dmytro Kuleba, Ukraine’s minister of foreign affairs, accused Russian soldiers of rape at an event in Chatham House in London earlier this month, according to Reuters. “When bombs fall on your cities, when soldiers rape women in the occupied cities — and we have numerous cases of, unfortunately, when Russian soldiers rape women in Ukrainian cities — it’s difficult, of course, to speak about the efficiency of international law,” Kuleba said. A report titled “2020 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices: Ukraine” published by the U.S. State Department noted several instances of abuse against both men and women linked to the conflict in Donbas in eastern Ukraine, which started in 2014. The report notes most of those instances took place when people were in detention, and none had been documented since 2017. “Beatings and electric shock in the genital area, rape, threats of rape, forced nudity, and threats of rape against family members were used as a method of torture and mistreatment to punish, humiliate, or extract confessions,” the report states.

He overestimated the abilities of his military to secure a rapid victory,” Fleming said in a Thursday speech in Australia. “Short of weapons and morale,” the Russians downed their own aircraft by mistake, he added. Fleming also confirmed that Moscow has deployed mercenaries and foreign fighters as part of its operation. The GCHQ (Government Communications Headquarters) is a top partner for U.S. intelligence, and Fleming’s statement is his first public comment on the Ukraine war since the invasion began on Feb. 24. “Even though we believe Putin’s advisers are afraid to tell him the truth, what’s going on and the extent of these misjudgements must be crystal clear to the regime,” Fleming continued. Russia’s military has lost seven generals and at least 7,000 soldiers as Ukrainian forces have resisted the easy Russian victory that analysts say Putin expected. Russian forces are enduring many more casualties in their ongoing bid to capture the strategic port city of Mariupol, according to a March 30 assessment of the war from the Institute for the Study of War think tank in Washington. “Russia is withdrawing some elements of its forces around [the Ukrainain capital of] Kyiv... for likely redeployment,” analysts Mason Clark, George Barros and Kateryna Stepanenko wrote. “But Russian forces will likely continue to hold their forwardmost positions and shell Ukrainian forces and residential areas.” Russia has repeatedly struck civilian targets, such as hospitals and shelters, in recent weeks, and Western officials worry that it will become more aggressive in doing so ― including by using banned chemical weapons and claiming the Ukrainians have done so. Fleming referred to that risk in his address: “On this and many other subjects, deeply secret intelligence is being released to make sure the truth is heard. At this pace and scale, this is unprecedented.” Negotiations between Russian and Ukrainian officials to secure a cease-fire have yet to bear fruit.",14,,,,1

Sources told The Wall Street Journal that members of the group developed red eyes, constant and painful tearing, and peeling skin on their faces and hands soon after their March 3 meeting. The report was corroborated by the investigative journalism website Bellingcat, which added that the symptoms subsided over the next week and their lives are not in danger. Chemical weapons experts told Bellingcat that, based on the likely toxin and dosage used, the act was intended to intimidate the victims instead of cause permanent harm. A source with direct knowledge of the matter told The Guardian that Abramovich lost his sight “for several hours” and required treatment in Turkey. A source with direct knowledge has just confirmed to me the WSJ/Bellingcat reports that Abramovich suffered symptoms of poisoning. ""Roman lost his sight for several hours"" and was treated in Turkey, the source said. Abramovich’s camp told the Journal it’s unclear who may have targeted the group.

Ukrainian negotiators were unwilling to confirm the incident.

Breedlove, speaking to CNN, explained how Russian President Vladimir Putin’s troops had “been unable to meet Ukrainian forces on these big force-on-force battles” with Ukrainians fighting a “wonderful, skirmishing rear-attack, ambush kind of fight that frustrates the military advance of Russia.” Putin’s frustration at his military failing to accomplish its goals was making him “more and more dangerous every day,” said Breedlove, as Moscow appeared to turn its focus away from seizing the capital Kyiv. “And when they can’t fight Ukrainian troops, they are going to fight and kill Ukrainian civilians as you have seen,” he continued, having earlier described indiscriminate attacks by Russia on people sheltering inside a theater in Mariupol and multiple humanitarian aid stations as war crimes. “The risk is going up every day because of the frustration of Putin and his army,” he added.

Photos and video posted on social media show the vessel, called the Orsk, burning in the port which was seized by Russian troops shortly after the start of Russia’s invasion last month. As the ship burns, at least two other ships are seen leaving the port with what appeared to be smaller fires burning on them. “The destroyed ship in Berdyansk could carry up to 20 tanks, 45 armored personnel carriers and 400 paratroopers,” the Ukrainian deputy defense minister, Hanna Malyar, said in a statement on Thursday, according to The New York Times. “This is a huge target that was hit by our military.” Ukrainian officials said two additional ships were damaged by Ukrainian forces and a 3,000-ton fuel tank was also destroyed, igniting a fire that spread to nearby ammunition supplies, according to The Associated Press. Berdyansk, which overlooks the Sea of Azov, is roughly 45 miles west of Ukraine’s main southeast port city of Mariupol.

Gen. James Marks put the blame for Russia’s faltering invasion of Ukraine firmly on Russian President Vladimir Putin and his excessive pride. Marks, now a military analyst for CNN, said Wednesday that Putin likely thought the invasion would be a 48-hour “cakewalk” with cities across Ukraine falling quickly to his troops. The war is now in its fourth week, with the United Nations estimating that some 7,000 to 15,000 Russian troops have been killed. “I mean, that’s hubris,” Marks told anchor Pamela Brown. “That’s a misunderstanding, a strategic miscalculation that’s incredibly huge. And Putin is in the intel business and he totally blew it. I mean, that’s phenomenal.” Russian forces were ill-prepared for the assault on their neighboring country as a direct result of Putin’s arrogance, Marks continued. “They thought they would … get into Kyiv and they’d immediately be welcomed and they’d have an opportunity to be replenished in (a) short amount of time. That has been totally exposed,” he explained. An “incredible lack of leadership” meant supplies couldn’t get to the front lines and Russian soldiers didn’t know what to do or why they were doing it, he said. “I mean, it’s a total collapse of the Russian military,” Marks added.

The indictments have been under seal since mid-2021 but were made public to bolster growing concerns that Russia may unleash cyberattacks against the U.S., Europe and other nations that have opposed its ongoing invasion of Ukraine. In one indictment from August 2021, Justice Department officials said three hackers from Russia’s federal security service (FSB), the Kremlin’s spy agency, worked to target and compromise the energy sector so it could “disrupt and damage such computer systems at a future time of its choosing.” The hacking took place between 2012 and 2017, and targeted “thousands of computers, at hundreds of companies and organizations, in approximately 135 countries,” officials alleged. A second indictment from June 2021 homed in on an employee of Russia’s ministry of defense and his co-conspirators, alleging Evgeny Viktorovich Gladkikh hacked a multinational energy company in 2017. Officials said the hackers installed malware that interfered with a refinery’s safety systems. Gladkikh spent six months in 2018 researching how he could deploy a similar effort at U.S. refineries. Today, @TheJusticeDept unsealed charges against four Russian government actors for their roles in separate malicious #cyber campaigns targeting the U.S. energy sector. “Russian state-sponsored hackers pose a serious and persistent threat to critical infrastructure both in the United States and around the world,” Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco said in a statement. “Although the criminal charges unsealed today reflect past activity, they make crystal clear the urgent ongoing need for American businesses to harden their defenses and remain vigilant.” The four Russians are not in U.S. custody, but a Justice Department official told The Guardian that the “benefit of revealing the results of the investigation now outweighs the likelihood of arrests in the future.” Russia does not extradite defendants to the United States, so the citizens will likely not be brought to trial. President Joe Biden has warned about the growing potential for Russian cyberattacks in recent days, saying he believed Russian President Vladimir Putin could soon turn to such tactics. “The more Putin’s back is against the wall, the greater the severity of the tactics he may employ … one of the tools he’s most likely to use, in my view, in our view, is cyberattacks,” Biden told reporters on Monday. “The magnitude of Russia’s cyber capacity is fairly consequential, and it’s coming.”",3,,,,10

Blinken highlighted a Russian attack on a maternity hospital in Mariupol and a United Nations estimate that the war has killed at least 2,500 Ukrainian civilians so far, and likely many more. “The U.S. will continue to track reports of war crimes and will share information we gather with allies, partners and international institutions and organizations,” the secretary added. “We are committed to pursuing accountability using every tool available, including criminal prosecution.” Earlier this month, the International Criminal Court launched an investigation into the Russian offensive after an uncommonly large number of countries referred the issue to the court’s chief prosecutor. Prosecutions could take place in U.S. courts if they have any jurisdiction over alleged war criminals or in third countries where such targets could be vulnerable, according to Beth Van Schaack, the Biden administration’s ambassador at large for global criminal justice. Van Schaak participated in a State Department press briefing after Blinken issued his statement. She noted that international law doctrine allows for high-ranking officials to be held responsible for the actions of their subordinates — raising the prospect of possible future cases against Russian President Vladimir Putin. Van Schaack declined to specify American intelligence identifying evidence of war crimes or particular incidents the U.S. is probing, but she noted that proof could include materials like intercepted signals. “Keeping the world apprised of what’s happening on the ground in Ukraine is extremely important,” she said.

David Petraeus","The reported deaths of five Russian generals in Ukraine is a sign of significant trouble for the Kremlin’s invasion, retired U.S. Gen. David Petraeus told Jake Tapper on CNN Sunday. “This is very, very uncommon. This is in the first three weeks,” said Petraeus. “These are quite senior generals.” Petraeus said four of the deaths have been confirmed. “I think the fifth we’ll hear today,” he added. Petraeus attributed the deaths to a variety of factors, including Ukrainians jamming Russian communications, skilled snipers and a Russian military structure that keeps decisions in very few hands. “The bottom line is that their command and control has broken down. Their communications have been jammed by the Ukrainians,” Petraeus said. “Their secure coms didn’t work. They had to go to a single channel that’s jammable ― and that’s exactly what the Ukrainians have been doing to that.” Without communication options, the military column gets stopped. And when an impatient general heads to the front to find out what’s going on, he’s shot and killed. “The Ukrainians have very, very good snipers and they’ve just been picking them off left and right,” Petraeus added. Retired Lt. Gen. Ben Hodges, the former commander of the U.S. Army in Europe, also said the Russians were in trouble in Ukraine. “Russian generals are running out of time, ammunition and manpower,” Hodges wrote in an assessment last week for the Center for European Policy Analysis. “That’s not based on any inside intelligence — it’s clear from open source information and my own experience.” In the latest blow to Russian military leadership, officials confirmed Sunday that navy commander Andrei Paly was killed in fighting in the Ukrainian city of Mariupol, Agence France-Presse reported.

Russian commander Col. Gen. Sergei Beseda was in charge of the FSB’s Ukraine operation, according to the Journal, citing a U.S. official. The unidentified American official also told the newspaper that “bickering had broken out” between the FSB and the Russian Ministry of Defense, which were the key government agencies planning the invasion. Citing Russian news sources, The New York Times reported that a second FSB official was also under house arrest. Russia’s military operation has not gone nearly as well as planned.

That’s bad news for officials surrounding Putin, observers warn. “When it comes to this guy, it’s clear that the culture of ‘someone is at fault and is going to pay’ is clearly still operative,” former CIA and National Security Council official Jeffrey Edmonds told the Journal. But the finger-pointing and rising fear and discontent in the Kremlin could also be bad news for Putin. Russian history scholar Stephen Kotkin said in a recent New Yorker interview that Putin is only getting the information that “he wants to hear.

Russia “got nine of its captive soldiers, born in 2002-2003 — practically children — conscripts Russia’s Defense Ministry said weren’t there,” Zarivna said.

His identity was reportedly confirmed by an aide to the Ukrainian Interior Ministry. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said a U.S. citizen had been killed in Ukraine but did not provide a name or further details. “My brother Jimmy Hill was killed yesterday in Chernihiv, Ukraine,” Cheryl Hill Gordon wrote on Facebook on Thursday afternoon. “He was waiting in a bread line with several other people when they were gunned down by Russian military [snipers].

Katya Hill said he was a social worker and forensic psychologist and had worked on and off in Ukraine for about 20 years. He traveled to Chernihiv in December to seek treatment for his partner Irina, a Ukrainian citizen who has multiple sclerosis, his friend told an Idaho news station earlier this month. After Russia invaded Ukraine, Hill and his companions were trapped inside a hospital with limited food, water and electricity. In a series of updates on Facebook in his final days, Hill said his partner, whom he called Ira, was in intensive care.

The Russian word for “children” was painted on the pavement in huge white letters on two sides of the building, according to satellite imagery from Maxars. There was no immediate information on the number of injuries or deaths. The word 'children' was painted in large Russian script on the ground outside the Mariupol Drama Theatre, Maxar satellite images collected on March 14 showed. Ukraine accused Russia of bombing the theater on Wednesday. Russia denies the attack  Ukrainian Minister of Foreign Affairs Dmytro Kuleba said the Drama Theater had been destroyed, calling it a “horrendous war crime.” “Russians could not have not known this was a civilian shelter,” Kuleba said in a tweet. While critics of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s war in Ukraine have been calling him a “war criminal” for weeks, on Wednesday U.S. President Joe Biden joined them. Another horrendous war crime in Mariupol. Massive Russian attack on the Drama Theater where hundreds of innocent civilians were hiding. The building is now fully ruined. Russians could not have not known this was a civilian shelter. Save Mariupol! Stop Russian war criminals!  “He’s a war criminal,” Biden said plainly. Russian troops have been laying siege to Mariupol for about two weeks, encircling the city and largely preventing civilians from leaving. Electricity, food, water and medicine are all running out. It’s a medieval tactic that Putin has used before with devastating consequences in Aleppo, Syria, in 2016 and in Grozny, Chechnya, in 2000. The plight of Mariupol has been chronicled for the Western world by two Associated Press journalists, who believe they are the only international members of the press still in the city. People have been melting snow for drinking water, they report, and venturing out only for essentials before returning to wherever they are sheltering from the persistent shelling. The number of casualties is unknown because it is often too dangerous to venture out to find the wounded and the dead; the official number is around 2,400, according to The New York Times. Russia claims that its forces are not targeting or killing civilians, but Russian artillery has decimated apartment buildings and hospitals, and killed people along evacuation routes. Ukrainian officials say Russian troops took 500 people ― about 100 doctors and patients and 400 people who lived in houses nearby ― hostage at one hospital in Mariupol late Tuesday. The troops allegedly rounded up neighbors and drove them to the hospital, using gunfire to prevent anyone from trying to leave. In the northern Ukrainian city of Chernihiv, Russians “shot and killed 10 people standing in line for bread,” the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv said Wednesday. The International Criminal Court at The Hague announced earlier this month that it was investigating whether war crimes were being committed by the Russians. Part of the rationale Putin has used to justify his invasion was a purported “genocide” in the eastern part of Ukraine, but the United Nations’ International Court of Justice said Wednesday that its investigation had found no evidence of such a genocide. In a largely symbolic gesture, the ICJ ordered Russia to halt its assault.",17,,,,29

General: Russia May Face Trouble In Ukraine ‘Within The Next 10 Days’,"A former U.S. Army general predicted Monday that the Russian military could soon run out of the manpower and weaponry needed to continue its invasion of Ukraine. Retired Lt. Gen. Ben Hodges, the former commander of U.S. Army forces in Europe, said recent moves by Russia to extend its campaign to western Ukraine and reports that the country had asked China for military supplies may mean the Kremlin is running out of steam. “Russia’s decision to transition to a war of attrition, where they’re smashing cities, putting civilians on the road for fear of being murdered, they need three things to do this, and they don’t have those three things,” Hodges said on MSNBC’s “Meet the Press.” “They don’t have the time, they don’t have the manpower and I don’t think they have the ammunition.” WATCH: Russia needs three things for a war of attrition that they don't have: ""the time ... the manpower and ... the ammunition,"" says @general_ben. ""Within the next 10 days Russia is going to culminate, which means they will not be able to continue the attack any further.""  Hodges’ comments were buoyed by evidence that Russia was running low on weaponry as Ukraine continued to mount a fiercer-than-expected resistance, notably around the capital of Kyiv. He said that if the West continued to support Ukrainians, it could be less than two weeks before the Russian military reached what he referred to as its culmination point. “Assuming that we, the West, not only continue but accelerate the delivery of the capabilities the Ukrainians need, I think within the next 10 days that Russia is going to culminate, which means they will not be able to continue the attack any further,” Hodges said. “So, it’s kind of a race, actually, if we give the Ukrainians enough so they can outlast Russia.” Russian forces will culminate within the next ten days if we maintain pressure on them...they have manpower problems and ammo shortages. Accelerate/expand support to UKR to destroy Russian arty, rockets, and cruise missiles. Now is the time to keep our foot on the gas. Hodges added that there was a big caveat to his prediction, a nod to Putin’s unpredictability during the invasion. “I’ve been wrong a lot,” he said. “I don’t have a crystal ball here.”",14,,,,23

And he’s warning Russian President Vladimir Putin that the end could be swift ― for both his military and his more than two-decade rule. “The collapse of their position could be sudden and catastrophic, rather than happening slowly through a war of attrition,” Fukuyama wrote for the American Purpose website. “The army in the field will reach a point where it can neither be supplied nor withdrawn, and morale will vaporize.” Fukuyama, author of 1992′s “The End of History and the Last Man,” blamed incompetent planning by Moscow, which anticipated that its forces would be welcomed in Ukraine. “Russian soldiers were evidently carrying dress uniforms for their victory parade in Kyiv rather than extra ammo and rations,” wrote Fukuyama, who holds several positions at Stanford, including Olivier Nomellini Senior Fellow at the university’s Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies. Now, those soldiers are stuck outside of cities, facing both supply issues and constant attacks from Ukrainian forces. If they’re defeated, he predicted, that would also spell the end of Putin. “Putin will not survive the defeat of his army,” Fukuyama wrote. “He gets support because he is perceived to be a strongman; what does he have to offer once he demonstrates incompetence and is stripped of his coercive power?

Elected Melitopol Mayor Ivan Fedorov was seen on video Friday with a hood over his head, being led away from a government building by armed men. The Russian-backed Luhansk regional prosecutor claimed that Fedorov had committed terrorism offenses and was under investigation. Newly installed unelected mayor Galina Danilchenko said in her televised statement that her “main task is to take all necessary steps to get the city back to normal,” CNN reported. “I ask you to keep your wits about you and not to give in to these provocations,” she added. Danilchenko also ironically suggested organizing a “People’s Choice Committee” to “solve all the critical issues for ... the Melitopol region.” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Friday lashed the kidnapping of Melitopol’s legitimate mayor, comparing it to the actions of “ISIS terrorists.” He called it a “crime against democracy.” The mayor of #Melitopol Ivan Fedorov was kidnapped, said Anton GerashchenkoAccording to him, Fyodorov refused to cooperate with the Russian military occupying the city. He was detained at the city crisis center, where he was in charge of the city's life support.  Russia has “transitioned into a new stage of terror, in which they try to physically liquidate representatives of Ukraine’s lawful local authorities,” Zelenskyy said in a video address. He called it “simple terrorism.” Federov’s disappearance sparked a protest Saturday by some 2,000 city residents outside its city hall occupied by Russian forces, The Washington Post reported. “Bring back the mayor!

Audio of the incident quickly went viral and became a symbol of Ukrainian resistance against the Russians. Though the border guards were first thought to have been killed, they are now reported to have been captured and are alive. Ukrposhta, the country’s postal service, announced a new stamp commemorating the event on Saturday. The stamp, created by artist Boris Groh, shows a Ukrainian border guard on an island facing a warship in the distance. He holds a rifle in one hand. His other hand gives the warship a confident middle finger. “With this stamp, you can send letters and postcards even abroad,” Ukrposhta wrote in a Facebook update. “And most importantly, they will have a sewn-in message that you already know well: ‘Russian warship, go fuck yourself!’” Groh was among 20 artists whose stamp design made it to a final voting round.

Images circulated around the world show four people lying bloodied and motionless on the pavement in Irpin, Ukraine, after they were fired on by Russian troops. Three of them were Serhiy Perebyinis’ loved ones: his wife, Tatiana, his 18-year-old son, Mykyta, and 9-year-old daughter, Alisa. The fourth was Anatoly Berezhnyi, a 26-year-old church volunteer who was helping the family, according to the Times. “I recognized the luggage and that is how I knew,” Perebyinis told the newspaper. Times photographer Lynsey Addario captured a widely viewed image of the four civilians that appeared on the paper’s front page. Perebyinis, a computer programmer, was not with his family because he was caring for his mother in Donetsk in eastern Ukraine, he told The Washington Post. He said his two dogs had also died. “I lost everyone and lost the meaning of life,” he told the Post, calling what happened to his family a “war crime.” Tatiana Perebyinis was the chief accountant for a software company headquartered in London, SE Ranking. The company said Monday it was devastated to learn of her death. “There are no words to describe our grief or to mend our pain,” the company said, adding that it was crucial to them that the family did not become “statistics.” “Her family became the victim of the unprovoked fire on civilians, which under any law is a crime against humanity,” the statement read. On Sunday, as residents of Irpin were trying to flee the area, Russian forces fired mortar shells on the city, including a bridge being used by evacuees, killing at least eight people, including Perebyinis’ family. Video from the moment of the strike shows a Ukrainian soldier standing outside a building before a sudden blast. As the debris and dust clear, soldiers can be seen running to a number of bodies on the ground. Someone is heard screaming for a medic, and a dog can be heard barking and howling. Ukraine has accused Russia of indiscriminately shelling heavily populated areas and violating agreements on humanitarian corridors to evacuate civilians. On Wednesday, at least three people, including a child, were killed after a Russian airstrike on a hospital in the city of Mariupol, the city council said. At least 549 civilians have been reported killed in the Russian invasion, though the real figure is likely higher, according to the United Nations.

Pentagon spokesperson John Kirby told The New York Times this week that U.S. analysts don’t have any details about the number of Syrians Russia has recruited or whether they may already be in Ukraine. Britain’s Ministry of Defense said Sunday that Russian forces likely made “minimal ground advances” over the weekend and that it was highly unlikely the Kremlin had achieved its military objectives to date.

A sign reading “President Zelensky Way” was posted outside the Consulate of Russia on Sunday afternoon in honor of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who has been fighting to fend off the invading Russian army. “It was a symbolic gesture on our part,” Claude Taylor, photographer and chair of the progressive Mad Dog PAC, told HuffPost. Taylor said the PAC’s longtime billboard designer, who is going only by his first name, Sean, is currently in Dnipro, Ukraine, with his wife, a citizen of the country.

Zelenskyy said a large number of Russians are believed to have died in the conflict so far, but he alleged that no one is keeping track. Russian President Vladimir Putin amassed around 150,000 troops to support the conflict, according to the Pentagon. Most have been deployed. “No one is counting them. No one cares how many die in the shellings,” Zelenskyy said. “They knew in advance they were not going to show to their families, to their mothers, what happened to their children, that they died here,” he went on. “They came here to kill us, and we are defending our freedom and our homes, and that’s why they’re dying.

The Telegraph previously reported that mobile crematoriums were expected to be used on the battlefield, citing U.K. Defense Secretary Ben Wallace. Putin pledged Thursday to grant the families of fallen soldiers 5 million rubles ― around $50,000 ― in what The New York Times said was the first time Putin publicly acknowledged that Russians have died in the war. The Russian leader also sought to downplay widespread reports that the Ukrainians have put up a much stronger defense than he’d anticipated, claiming that the “special military operation in Ukraine” is “going strictly according to the schedule just as it has been planned.” The Russian Defense Ministry on Wednesday announced that nearly 500 of its soldiers have been killed and another 1,600 injured, although Western estimates are significantly higher. Ukraine says its fighters have killed more than 5,000 Russian troops. An American official told The New York Times the figure is more like 2,000. Russia reportedly took control of the Ukrainian port city Kherson this week ― the first major city to be taken over. But according to the Pentagon, and scattered reports, the Russian military is facing a serious morale problem made worse by food shortages.

Five people died in the bombing. “To the world: what is the point of saying «never again» for 80 years, if the world stays silent when a bomb drops on the same site of Babyn Yar? At least 5 killed. History repeating…” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy tweeted Tuesday. The attack comes after Russian President Vladimir Putin invoked World War II as a justification for invading Ukraine, saying he wanted to “denazify” the country. As The Washington Post noted, Putin’s comments were likely meant to help sell the invasion back home, where “rhetoric around fighting fascism resonates deeply” still. Other countries quickly called Putin out for his cynical twisting of history. To start, Zelenskyy himself is Jewish and had family members killed in the Holocaust. Putin’s target may not have been Babyn Yar, but rather the TV tower located close to the memorial. The New York Times reported that videos captured at least two other explosions in the area, in addition to the one that struck the tower itself. But the damaging of Babyn Yar further delegitimizes Putin’s purported motives. Babyn Yar is the site of one of the worst mass murders of Jews during the Holocaust. On Sept. 29-30, 1941, Nazi killing squads executed more than 33,000 people there. Nazis murdered an estimated 100,000 people at Babyn Yar during World War II. In response to the Babyn Yar attack Tuesday, the Auschwitz Memorial in Poland tweeted, “It’s hard to expect the Russian army to respect the dead if it is not capable of respecting human lives.” Last week, it also said in a statement that people in Ukraine were being killed “purely because of insane pseudo-imperial megalomania.” The U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum also tweeted its outrage about Babyn Yar on Tuesday. And previously, it called out Putin for exploiting the Holocaust to invade Ukraine. “In justifying this attack, Vladimir Putin has misrepresented and misappropriated Holocaust history by claiming falsely that democratic Ukraine needs to be ‘denazified,’” the museum said in a statement on Feb. 24. “Equally groundless and egregious are his claims that Ukrainian authorities are committing ‘genocide’ as a justification for the invasion of Ukraine.” The White House said Zelenskyy and President Joe Biden spoke Tuesday about continued U.S. support for Ukraine.

The missile strike took place Saturday morning as Russian forces continued their invasion of the country. Videos verified by The New York Times show the missile impact at several angles and the destruction left in its wake. Videos and photos verified by The New York Times showed a residential building struck by a missile in southwestern Kyiv, about 1.5 miles from Sikorsky Memorial Airport, on Saturday morning. Videos showed rescue and evacuation efforts underway.  The high-rise apartment building is near the city’s two passenger airports. Though no fatalities have been reported, a rescue worker said six civilians were injured in the attack, according to The Associated Press. One video published by The New York Times showed rescue workers carrying an injured woman. U.S. President Joe Biden has issued heavy sanctions against Russia and its leaders and oligarchs, including Russian President Vladimir Putin, in response to the invasion. Biden is now weighing whether to exclude Russia from SWIFT, a high-security network that connects thousands of financial institutions around the world, CNN reported Saturday. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has stood defiant against Putin’s invasion of his country, and turned down an American offer early Saturday to be evacuated from Kyiv. “The fight is here,” Zelenskyy said, according to the Ukrainian Embassy in the U.K. “I need ammunition, not a ride.”",17,,,,29

A group of Ukrainian border guards were stationed on Snake Island, in the Black Sea south of Odessa, when a Russian warship ordered them to surrender under threat of attack. Their response: ""Russian warship, go fuck yourself.""They held their ground. All 13 were killed.  Zelenskyy said in an address that the guards had attempted to protect the island, resisting demands from Russian forces to lay down their arms. Anton Gerashchenko, an adviser to the Ukrainian interior minister, posted audio to Facebook in which Russian forces can be heard telling the soldiers to surrender and “avoid bloodshed,” according to a translation by The Washington Post. The garrison refused, with one soldier saying, “Russian warship, go fuck yourself,” and were all killed in an artillery strike. Zelenskyy said the 13 soldiers would be honored posthumously with the Hero of Ukraine award. Russia treacherously attacked our state in the morning, as Nazi Germany did in #2WW years. As of today, our countries are on different sides of world history. 🇷🇺 has embarked on a path of evil, but 🇺🇦 is defending itself & won't give up its freedom no matter what Moscow thinks. Snake Island, also known as Zmiinyi Island, is about 30 miles off the coast of Ukraine and is less than 42 acres. The Post noted that the island marks the edge of Ukraine’s territorial waters and serves as a strategic post in the Black Sea. Zelenskyy said at least 137 people have been killed in Ukraine since the beginning of Russia’s invasion and hundreds had been wounded. That tally was expected to climb as Russian forces closed in on the capital, Kyiv, and Zelenskyy said in his address that “the fate of the country depends fully on our army, security forces, all of our defenders.”",17,,,,15

The president said the sanctions would hit two major Russian banks and make it harder for Moscow to raise money by selling its sovereign debt. Meanwhile, the U.S. will send U.S. soldiers from elsewhere in Europe to Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania — countries that were formerly part of the Soviet Union but have since become democracies and U.S. allies as part of the NATO military alliance. “We have no intention of fighting Russia,” Biden said. “We want to send an unmistakable message, though, that the United States and our allies will defend every inch of NATO territory.” The U.S. views Putin’s move to bolster Russian-backed breakaway regions in Ukraine as an invasion. Washington and its friends plan to soon unveil further steps to punish Russia and deter further escalation. “As Russia contemplates its next move, we have our next move prepared as well,” Biden said, adding that he believes Putin plans to escalate his incursion. “The United States will continue to provide defensive assistance to Ukraine.” Washington is also placing sanctions on influential Russians close to Putin and their family members, the president added. The group includes Russian spy chief Alexander Bortnikov, Putin aide Sergei Kiriyenko and three well-connected businessmen. Biden’s remarks came after Putin said the separatists should control a much larger portion of Ukraine than they already do, possibly signaling that Russian troops will fight the Western-backed Ukrainian army to capture new territory and set off a longer, bloodier conflict. Russia has also begun evacuating its diplomatic facilities in Ukraine. The U.S. is not obligated to defend Ukraine, but American officials and national security experts say a Russian-led upheaval of the status quo in Europe would endanger NATO states and would drive long-term instability. As Putin has amassed over 100,000 troops along Ukraine’s borders in recent months, NATO members have sent military support to Ukraine and reinforced their own forces in Russia’s neighborhood. Russia says NATO must withdraw from countries on its periphery — despite their independence — and promise to never accept Ukraine as a member. Earlier in the day, NATO member Germany said it would halt a pipeline project that would have let Russia earn millions of dollars by pumping gas across Europe. Berlin’s move vindicated the Biden administration’s strategy of warm, close cooperation with U.S. allies — undercutting Republicans’ claims that the president must intensely pressure European nations like Germany. German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said Tuesday that her country wants to remain united with its friends and show “a stop sign” to Russia. In a call with reporters on Tuesday afternoon, a senior Biden administration official called the pipeline, known as Nord Stream 2, “a cash cow” for Putin and said the pause represented “a major turning point in the world’s energy independence from Russia.” The U.S. will continue “to reduce Europe’s addiction to Russian gas,” the official added, and is ready to impose broader, more painful measures like targeting Sberbank, Russia’s largest financial bank, and cutting Moscow off from the SWIFT financial system. Western governments still hope that diplomacy can tamp down tensions on the continent, Biden said. The administration official noted that simply placing the maximum of sanctions on Russia is not America’s goal: “Sanctions are meant to deter and prevent. We want to prevent a large-scale of invasion of Ukraine,” the official said. And the president notably did not mention the possibility that he will hold a summit with Putin, though Secretary of State Antony Blinken did later cancel a planned meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. For now, “we still believe Russia is poised to go much further,” Biden said.",29,,,,29
2022-02-22,HuffPost,https://www.huffpost.com/entry/russia-invades-ukraine_n_61ef3ad2e4b07c5f39bb76a5,"White House Says Russia Is Invading Ukraine, Rapidly Escalating Border Crisis","Russian troops have begun invading neighboring Ukraine, a White House official said Tuesday, defying fierce diplomatic efforts by world leaders and President Joe Biden’s threats of severe economic retaliation. A White House national security adviser, Jonathan Finer, told CNN that “the beginning” of Russia’s “latest invasion” was underway and that Biden would be rolling out new sanctions against Russia “in a matter of hours.” ""An invasion is an invasion and that is what is under way,"" says WH Principal Deputy National Security Adviser Jon Finer as Putin orders troops into Eastern Ukraine.  Russian President Vladimir Putin said Monday that he sees parts of eastern Ukraine that are controlled by separatist militias as independent countries and wants to redraw European borders for the first time in decades ― a violation of international law. The Kremlin previously published decrees ordering Russia’s defense ministry to deploy what it called “peacekeeping” forces in Ukraine’s Donetsk and Luhansk regions, the two Russia-backed separatist territories. At the time, it wasn’t immediately clear whether or when Russian troops would enter Ukraine and choose to fight the Western-backed Ukrainian military. The invasion comes after an increasingly tense crisis between Russia and Ukraine, which has been trying to escape Russia’s grip by moving closer toward becoming a democracy and aligning itself with the West. Russia has been building up its military along its 1,200-mile border with Ukraine since 2014, but recently accelerated its moves to try and force the U.S. and its allies to promise to keep the smaller nation out of the NATO military alliance. Russia’s buildup of more than 150,000 troops along the Ukrainian border allows for the international superpower to launch a combined-arms assault from multiple directions if it chooses to do so. Putin’s support of the Donetsk- and Luhansk-based separatists ― which he first revealed to his French and German counterparts ― threw away a yearslong diplomatic effort by the two countries to end fighting between Ukraine and the Russian-backed separatists. The Biden administration and its allied countries have warned that a massive war could break out should Russia invade the Ukrainian regions, causing widespread instability and violence in Europe. The White House has repeatedly said that U.S. troops will not fight Russians on behalf of Ukraine, but has sent thousands of American soldiers to European ally countries that have their own safety concerns related to Russia’s actions. The U.S. has also sent Ukraine military aid, and has promised to impose severe sanctions on Russia in response to further action. In response to Putin’s announcement recognizing two eastern Ukrainian regions as independent countries, the White House said that Biden would issue an executive order banning new investment, trade and financing by Americans “to, from, or in the so-called DNR and LNR regions of Ukraine.” “This E.O. will also provide authority to impose sanctions on any person determined to operate in those areas of Ukraine,” White House press secretary Jen Psaki said on Monday. “To be clear: these measures are separate from and would be in addition to the swift and severe economic measures we have been preparing in coordination with Allies and partners should Russia further invade Ukraine.” Germany on Tuesday said it would pause a pipeline that would have dramatically increased its imports of Russian gas. The U.S. and the United Kingdom have also been arming Ukraine, as have the Baltic states. Biden, French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz had been working to negotiate with Putin to de-escalate the border crisis, suggesting they do not see Ukraine as a potential NATO member and offering to recognize Russia’s stature and interests. “We believe President Putin has made the decision, but until the tanks are actually rolling, and the planes are flying, we will use every opportunity and every minute we have to see if diplomacy can still dissuade President Putin from carrying this forward,” U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Sunday on CNN. Those efforts appear to have failed. In mid-February, Putin claimed that Russia had begun a partial pullback in its military presence near the Ukraine border. However, U.S. officials denied that claim and instead accused Russia of increasing the number of troops at the border by 7,000. Ahead of the invasion, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy asked to meet with Putin in hopes of reaching a “peaceful settlement.” To try to help prevent escalation into an attack on Ukraine, Biden held a virtual summit with Putin on Dec. 7. Then, from Jan. 10 to Jan. 12, three discussions took place: one between the U.S. and Russia, one between NATO countries and Russia, and one among members of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). None ended with a solution. On Jan. 21, Blinken tried to renew the efforts by meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov in Geneva, Switzerland. That meeting also resulted in an impasse. During talks, Russia gave a series of demands in order to agree to a more peaceful approach. Some of the demands are automatically off the table with U.S. and NATO allies, such as Moscow wanting guarantees NATO would not expand eastward, including to Ukraine, and a rolling back of military deployment to some former Soviet states. The demands are “a Russian attempt, not only to secure [Putin’s] interest in Ukraine, but essentially re-litigate the security architecture of Europe,” Michael Kofman, the Russia studies research director at analysis organization CNACNA, told Vox. NATO allies released a statement during the 2008 summit in Bucharest saying they look forward to eventually welcoming Ukraine and Georgia as members. This heightened concerns for Russia, which already opposed the alliance’s decision to admit 14 new members after the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union. While the alliance is currently divided on admitting Ukraine and Georgia, it still insists on keeping its door open to new members. Nations can join only if all existing members agree to allow them in. Because NATO is considered a defensive military alliance, Russia views Ukraine joining the alliance as a security issue, considering the vast border it shares with the country.",29,,,,2

Putin announced his position in a televised address in which he questioned whether Ukraine and other nations that emerged from the Soviet Union should be independent and accused Western governments of threatening Russia. He later ordered Russian troops to the Ukrainian regions. The Russian leader’s move dramatically escalates the security crisis in Eastern Europe, where he has posted 150,000 troops in recent weeks and the U.S. has warned that a devastating all-out war could break out. Putin first revealed his decision in a call to his French and German counterparts on Monday evening ― scuttling a yearslong diplomatic process by their two countries to end fighting between Ukraine and Russian-backed separatists. “We are not afraid of anyone,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy told the nation after Russia recognized the separatist regions’ independence. President Joe Biden has repeatedly said American troops will not fight Russians on behalf of Ukraine. But he has sent the Ukrainians military support and posted thousands of U.S. soldiers in European ally countries that worry Moscow will prompt regional chaos or threaten them. Biden met with his national security team, including the secretaries of state and defense, as Putin was speaking, according to a White House statement. The president also spoke with Zelenskyy. Officials in the U.S. and its allied countries say allowing Russia to force changes in other countries against their will risks instability and widespread violence. They have promised to slap aggressive sanctions on Putin for a further incursion into Ukraine. From Moscow’s point of view, the Ukrainian government in Kyiv has grown alarmingly close to the West since Ukrainian demonstrators toppled a Putin-linked ruler in 2014. In his speech, Putin claimed that Western officials now run the country and their Ukrainian partners are mismanaging post-Soviet institutions down to the postal service and trying to quash their people’s historic ties to Russia. Russia has sought to retain influence over neighboring countries like Ukraine and challenged their bids to explore other partnerships such as the NATO military alliance. As Putin has built up his deployment along Ukraine’s borders, he has urged Western leaders to promise to never let the country join NATO and issued other demands such as a NATO withdrawal from the Baltic countries of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia — democratic treaty allies of the U.S. Biden, French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz have tried to negotiate with their Russian counterpart by hinting that they do not see Ukraine as a candidate for NATO membership and offering to recognize Russia’s stature and interests. On Sunday, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said in an emailed statement that Biden was willing to hold a high-profile summit with Putin “if an invasion hasn’t happened.” “We are always ready for diplomacy,” Psaki said. “We are also ready to impose swift and severe consequences should Russia instead choose war. And currently, Russia appears to be continuing preparations for a full-scale assault on Ukraine very soon.” Josep Borrell, the foreign policy chief for the European Union, said Monday that Russia would face EU sanctions over recognizing the Ukrainian rebels’ claim to sovereignty. Analysts are now watching how far Russia will go to support the independence of the Ukrainian separatists: whether Putin tells Russian troops to fight the Western-backed Ukrainian military and whether the conflict expands beyond the borders of the breakaway Ukrainian regions, which are collectively known as the Donbas. “The best-case scenario ― from a human life standpoint ― is that it all ends at the current line of control: if Russian troops go in and Ukrainian troops fortify but don’t try to push the [line] forward,” Sam Greene, a professor at King’s College London, tweeted on Monday. Some of his colleagues foresee a more dreary result. To Michael Kofman of the CNA think tank, the size of the Russian deployment suggests Putin has greenlit an operation that extends beyond the Donbas “to impose regime change” in Ukraine. For the Biden administration and its partners, the coming days will involve complex diplomacy and likely pressure on Moscow ― though officials and experts have struggled to craft an effective strategy given Putin’s focus on the matter and frequently shifting narrative of the crisis. “It’s hard to listen to this speech and believe that any of the partial concessions that have been suggested - withdrawing the possibility of NATO membership from Ukraine in particular - would have made any difference,” national security commentator Cheryl Rofer tweeted amid the Russian leader’s remarks.",29,,,,2

In a statement, U.S. Space Command (which is different than Space Force) confirmed “a debris-generating event” occurred, but notably declined to mention the cause or Russia. Two U.S. officials told CNN that Russia carried out an antisatellite test over the weekend, and one suggested a link to the debris. That scenario is bolstered by a report from Seradata, a private space data and analysis company that tracked a suspected ground-launched antisatellite missile strike from Russia. The missile struck a defunct Soviet-era intelligence satellite that had been in orbit since 1982 and scattered at least 14 pieces of debris large enough to be tracked, according to Seradata. If confirmed, it would be Russia’s fourth such antisatellite test. The seven astronauts aboard the ISS had to repeatedly take safety measures Monday, sheltering in their docked capsules while the station passed the orbiting junk. “We are actively working to characterize the debris field and will continue to ensure all space-faring nations have the information necessary to maneuver satellites if impacted,” U.S. Space Command said. “We are also in the process of working with the interagency, including the State Department and NASA, concerning these reports and will provide an update in the near future.” Last week, the ISS had to alter its orbit after a chunk of an old Chinese satellite ― created by an antisatellite missile test by the Chinese in 2007 ― came close to the station. Even tiny bits of space debris can be disastrous for the space station. In June, a 5mm (0.20-inch) wide piece of junk traveling at 17,500 mph punched a hole through a thermal blanket wrapped around the station’s 60-foot robotic Canadarm2.",3,,,,8

There is concern within the U.S. intelligence community that the hackers who targeted Treasury and the Commerce Department’s National Telecommunications and Information Administration used a similar tool to break into other government agencies, according to four people briefed on the matter. The people did not say which other agencies. Three of the people familiar with the investigation said Russia is currently believed to be behind the attack. Two of the people said that the breaches are connected to a broad campaign that also involved the recently disclosed hack on FireEye, a major U.S. cybersecurity company with government and commercial contracts. “The United States government is aware of these reports and we are taking all necessary steps to identify and remedy any possible issues related to this situation,” said National Security Council spokesman John Ullyot. The hack is so serious it led to a National Security Council meeting at the White House on Saturday, said one of the people familiar with the matter. The Commerce Department confirmed there was a breach at one of its agencies in a statement. “We have asked the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency and the FBI to investigate, and we cannot comment further at this time.” The breach presents a major challenge to the incoming administration of President-elect Joe Biden as officials investigate what information was stolen and try to ascertain what it will be used for. It is not uncommon for large scale cyber investigations to take months or years to complete. “This is a much bigger story than one single agency,” said one of the people familiar with the matter. “This is a huge cyber espionage campaign targeting the U.S. government and its interests.” Hackers broke into the NTIA’s office software, Microsoft’s Office 365. Staff emails at the agency were monitored by the hackers for months, sources said. A Microsoft spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Neither did a spokesman for the Treasury Department. The hackers are “highly sophisticated” and have been able to trick the Microsoft platform’s authentication controls, according to a person familiar with the incident, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not allowed to speak to the press. “This is a nation state,” said a different person briefed on the matter. The full scope of the breach is unclear. The investigation is still its early stages and involves a range of federal agencies, including the FBI, according to three of the people familiar with the matter. A spokesperson for the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency said they have been “working closely with our agency partners regarding recently discovered activity on government networks. CISA is providing technical assistance to affected entities as they work to identify and mitigate any potential compromises.” The FBI and U.S. National Security Agency did not immediately respond to a request for comment. There is some indication that the email compromise at NTIA dates back to this summer, although it was only recently discovered, according to a senior U.S. official.

A European diplomat this week joined Amnesty International in condemning the work of the Working Group on Syria, Propaganda and Media (WGSPM), saying its members were either “unwittingly and naively acting as agents of propaganda for the Russians, or actively support[ing] Russian disinformation.” None of the academics – one of whom left his job last year after it emerged he was a supporter of 9/11 conspiracy theories – is an expert in the Middle East, Syria or chemical weapons, and the group has previously been accused of “whitewashing war crimes.” Yet speaking at the United Nations Security Council last week, a senior Russian official praised the “recognized experts and reputable scientists” of the WGSPM, citing their work as he claimed a chemical weapons attack in 2018 never happened. The same day, another Russian official tweeted a link to the group’s work that accuses the civilian search and rescue group the White Helmets of being “actively involved” in murdering civilians to frame the Syrian government. There is no reliable evidence to support the theory and an investigation by the globally recognized Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) concluded that a chemical attack did occur. It is indeed very likely the victims at Douma were murdered captives. As such a potential warcrime and one that is being covered up by @opcw management, western governments and most of the mainstream media. But the truth is coming out. Although not mandated to attribute blame, the report found chlorine gas was released from two canisters that had been dropped from the air. Syrian government and Russian forces are the only ones equipped with aircraft meaning opposition forces could not have carried out the attack. It fits a well-documented pattern of chemical weapons use by the Syrian government of Bashar al-Assad against civilian targets. A European diplomat told HuffPost UK: “There is wide and serious concern about the extent to which academics in the WGSPM appear to be pursuing issues which so closely overlay with Russian lies and propaganda, particularly on the use of chemical weapons in Syria. “Russia appears to be using these academics to amplify and bolster their own disinformation, particularly to undermine the OPCW and divert attention from their own activities. “It is unclear whether these academics are unwittingly and naively acting as agents of propaganda for the Russians – or they actively support Russian misinformation. “Either way, it is difficult to see how their involvement with WGSPM is compatible with having any official role in academia.” The WGSPM counts a number of academics among its members including professors Tim Hayward and Paul McKeigue of the University of Edinburgh, Professor David Miller of the University of Bristol and Dr Tara McCormack of the University of Leicester. It was established in 2017 by Piers Robinson, who used to teach at Sheffield University but left last year after HuffPost UK reported he was a supporter of 9/11 conspiracy theories. Robinson told HuffPost at the time that his “decision to leave [...] was based on a number of reasons relating to both professional goals and personal circumstances,” and that he was not “criticized or pressured to leave by the university because of my research or public statements.” Shadi Hamid, senior fellow and Middle East expert at the Brookings Institute thinktank, told HuffPost UK: “These academics don’t know enough about the Middle East to be able to sort through what is real and what is not real. “And because these people don’t know a lot about the Middle East, they are susceptible to these kinds of bonkers ideas.” It is also an established fact that a) the White Helmets are basically Al Q (they provide most of the reporting from Jihadi held areas and b) that hospitals are used as bases by these groups. The WGSPM has published a number of papers that all echo Russian disinformation lines and suggest western governments or those working for them are actually responsible for events such as the Skripal poisoning. Some 40 people were killed in a chemical weapons attack in the Syrian town of Douma in April 2018. Shortly afterwards, the WGSPM set about trying to prove it had been staged by the White Helmets as a means of justifying the U.S., UK and French missile strikes against the Assad government that had followed. Eliot Higgins of the investigative website Bellingcat told HuffPost UK: “It’s a theory without any evidence to support it. The ‘working group’ are just useful idiots. “This kind of denial of war crimes in Syria – it’s like saying vaccines cause autism, or that 9/11 was an inside job. “It’s insane and the fact their universities still employ them is embarrassing for their universities.” The WGSPM does not provide any video, picture or documentary evidence to support its theory. Instead, its central argument — which it describes as “[t]he clearest evidence that the White Helmets were actively involved in managinga massacre of civilians” — rests on a separate attack in 2017 which it argues Syrian jets could not have carried out because of its location. (The OPCW disagrees.) The Working Group, at something of a stretch, then concludes that “the only possible alternative” is for the White Helmets to have been actively involved in “managing a massacre.” The WGSPM’s claim that the OPCW report is wrong eschews experts and instead relies heavily on a number of dubious sources, many that the academics came across via Twitter, including: When asked by HuffPost UK about the sources the WGSPM has used in its research, Robinson stood by them all, adding: “We do not ‘rely on’ these sources: in each of the instances you list, we have examined the original material and drawn our own conclusions.” The group’s conspiracy theory was given an apparent boost last year by a leaked internal report penned by an OPCW worker that appeared to cast doubt on the widely held belief that a chemical weapons attack had indeed taken place. But a source close to the OPCW told HuffPost UK that the document given to the Working Group was based on incorrect assumptions and ignored crucial evidence on which the OPCW investigation’s final conclusions were based – just one of the reasons it was not reflected in the eventual public report. A further source cited by the academics was a series of leaked anonymous emails apparently written by a different OPCW staffer questioning the organization’s work. HuffPost UK, however, has learned that much of the OPCW’s investigation was conducted after the whistleblower, self-styled as “Alex,” left the organization. The OPCW has stood by its conclusion that a chemical attack using chlorine as a weapon did happen. Russia intervened in Syria in 2015 in support of President Bashar al-Assad’s violent crushing of a popular revolution. It has subsequently sought to discredit and veto OPCW investigations that have directly accused its ally of a number of chemical weapons attacks. The Kremlin’s version of what happened in Douma has changed numerous times, from “no attack happened at all” to “British spies did it” to “the White Helmets did it” and various theories in between. Kate Starbird, an expert in online disinformation networks at the University of Washington, told HuffPost UK: “It has all the elements of ‘throw as many different conspiracy theories at the wall until we find one that sticks.’ “It’s taken a few years for them to find one that sticks but the techniques are so similar to what we’ve seen in other events like the [downing of flight] MH17 and the Skripal poisoning.” Why do you refer to ""Assad's Chemical Attacks""? Can you not distinguish speculation from established fact? In November last year Russia’s own OPCW representative addressed The Hague and praised the “dozens of experts, recognised and respected people, with remarkable international reputations, led by Professor Robinson” as it made its case that the OPCW had been hijacked by western nations in order to frame the Syrian government. Russian state media channels have been working hard to promote the narrative, and RT – formerly Russia Today – provided Robinson and McCormack with a platform to air their views. ""You have a corruption of the independence of the OPCW""@PiersRobinson1, co-director of the Organisation for Propaganda Studies discusses war, propaganda and crushing dissent with @uniofleicester's @McCormack_Tara on @Renegade_Inc.MORE:  Caroline Orr, a behavioural scientist who specialises in disinformation networks on social media, told HuffPost UK the paper was “the latest in a long line of misleading and defamatory claims from the ‘working group.’” “It’s done for the purpose of creating confusion about what’s going on in Syria,” she said, “to make people doubt the facts and, ultimately, to bury evidence of some of the most heinous atrocities and war crimes in modern history. “If you look at the tactics they use, they’re straight out of a propaganda handbook.” Undeterred, Russia has stuck to the theory and last week reiterated the claim at the UN. If so, the question arises of who was involved in the staging? The White Helmets are an obvious candidate since they admit to have produced the film of the dead civilians and it is known that they were involved in arranging the bodies of the dead including children. Kristyan Benedict, Amnesty International UK’s Syria campaign manager, told HuffPost UK: “Discrediting the White Helmets is partly about discrediting war crimes evidence. “The White Helmets’ filming at attack sites has meant they’ve built up a significant body of evidence of potential war crimes by pro-Assad and Russian forces – something neither Damascus nor Moscow views kindly. “The millions of Syrians whose lives have been devastated by years of barrel bombing, chemical weapons attacks, imprisonment, torture and killing deserve genuine truth and justice, not this squalid propaganda.” “The millions of Syrians whose lives have been devastated by years of barrel bombing, chemical weapons attacks, imprisonment, torture and killing deserve genuine truth and justice, not this squalid propaganda.” Two days after Russia spoke at the UN, Robinson and Miller appeared at a briefing in parliament sponsored by Labour’s shadow peace and disarmament minister, Fabian Hamilton. Hamilton has insisted he was unaware of who would be speaking when his office agreed to book a room for an anti-war collective “to discuss the OPCW report.” Hamilton’s spokesperson added that the shadow minister “does not support [the speakers’] offensive and factually incorrect views”. His spokesperson told HuffPost UK: “Fabian fully supports the OPCW’s conclusions into the vile chemical attacks that took place in Douma in 2018. “Any suggestion that Fabian somehow supports the ridiculous conspiracy theories held by some of the attendees at this event are ludicrous.” Responding to questions from HuffPost UK, Robinson maintained that the OPCW report “can reasonably be described as fraudulent by the standards applied to scientific reporting.” He added: “As far as we know, no one is denying that the Douma incident and other alleged chemical attacks in Syria were war crimes. “We are investigating these crimes, and making some progress in identifying the perpetrators and those in the media who collude with them.” (Infographics supplied by Statista)",3,,,,26
2019-12-09,HuffPost,https://www.huffpost.com/entry/russia-banned-from-olympic-games-over-doping-scandal_n_5dee24f6e4b07f6835b5da35,Russia Banned From Olympic Games Over Doping Scandal,"MOSCOW, Dec 9 (Reuters) — Russia was banned from the Olympics and world championships in a range of sports for four years on Monday after the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) ruled to punish it for manipulating laboratory data, a WADA spokesman said. WADA’s executive committee took the decision after it concluded that Moscow had tampered with laboratory data by planting fake evidence and deleting files linked to positive doping tests that could have helped identify drug cheats. The WADA committee’s decision to punish Russia with a ban was unanimous, the spokesman said. Russia, which has tried to showcase itself as a global sports power, has been embroiled in doping scandals since a 2015 report commissioned by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) found evidence of mass doping in Russian athletics. Its doping woes have grown since, with many of its athletes sidelined from the past two Olympics and the country stripped of its flag altogether at last year’s Pyeongchang Winter Games as punishment for state-sponsored doping cover-ups at the 2014 Sochi Games. Monday’s sanctions had been recommended by WADA’s compliance review committee in response to the doctored laboratory data provided by Moscow earlier this year. One of the conditions for the reinstatement of Russian anti-doping agency RUSADA, which was suspended in 2015 in the wake of the athletics doping scandal but reinstated last year, had been that Moscow provide an authentic copy of the laboratory data. The sanctions effectively strip the agency of its accreditation. Sports Minister Pavel Kolobkov last month attributed the discrepancies in the laboratory data to technical issues. The punishment, however, leaves the door open for clean Russian athletes to compete at major international sporting events without their flag or anthem for four years, as was the case during the 2018 Pyeongchang Olympics. Some Russian officials, meanwhile, have branded the call for sanctions unfair and likened it to broader Western attempts to hold back the country. If RUSADA appeals the sanctions endorsed by WADA’s executive committee, the case will be referred to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS), WADA has said.
