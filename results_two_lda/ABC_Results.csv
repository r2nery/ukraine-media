2022-11-08,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/International/ukraine-asks-us-capabilities-fighting-iranian-drones/story?id=92826420,Ukraine asks US for new capabilities in fighting Iranian drones,"ABC News has obtained a letter sent by a top Ukrainian official to senior members of Congress, asking them to assist Ukraine's calls for additional air defense systems to counter the attack drones built and supplied by Iran to bolster Russia's war effort. Russia has launched waves of deadly attacks in recent weeks, using Iranian-made drones that explode on impact to strike power plants, killing civilians and causing rolling blackouts, plunging millions of Ukrainian homes into darkness. In the letter, the chairman of the Ukrainian parliament, Ruslan Stefanchuk, calls on the U.S. to provide Ukraine with highly mobile air defense systems known as C-RAMs, saying they would help protect ""important objects, especially crucial power plants."" C-RAMs have a built-in radar to track incoming threats and a giant rapid-fire gun to shoot them down, with NATO saying the ""most effective"" systems are able to fire 4,500 rounds per minute. A senior Ukrainian politician told ABC News that the Ukrainian government has also made an official request to the Biden administration for the C-RAMs systems. ABC contacted the Ukranian Ministry of Defense for comment. The Pentagon does not comment on specific Ukrainian requests for weaponry. However, Pentagon spokesperson Lt. Col. Garron Garn told ABC News this week that U.S. support ""focuses on equipment that is relevant for the current fight."" ""We are working around the clock to fulfill Ukraine's priority security assistance requests, delivering weapons from U.S. stocks when they are available,"" he added. As things stand, Ukrainian officials say they are using an array of methods to shoot down the drones. Ukrainian fighter jets are being used to track them and, in some instances, shoot them down, according to the Ukrainian politician who has been briefed on the matter. ""We are using all kinds of different stuff [to destroy the Iranian drones],"" the source told ABC News, adding that the Ukrainian military even sometimes resorts to shoulder-launched anti-tank weapons to counter the threat. The White House last month indicated that Russia is launching Iranian-supplied drones from Crimea, a peninsula to the south of mainland Ukraine that was illegally annexed by Russia in 2014. The White House National Security Council spokesperson, John Kirby, also said at the time that a ""relatively small number"" of Iranian personnel had been on the ground in Crimea to assist the Russians in how to operate the drones. The drones fly slowly, giving the Ukrainian military a matter of hours from the moment they are launched from Crimea, through to when they reach their targets, Ukrainian officials said. However, Ukrainian officials said the drones are able to change trajectory mid-flight, making it harder for the military to position assets that could shoot them down. In his letter, Stefanchuk also asks senior U.S. lawmakers to assist him in asking the Biden administration to provide longer-range missiles so that the Ukrainian military could destroy targets such as ""stocks of Iranian drones, deep behind the enemy lines on the occupied territory of Ukraine."" On Monday, Ukraine's defense minister announced that advanced air defense systems for countering Russian missiles and rockets, called NASAMS, had arrived in Ukraine. A senior U.S. official confirmed that two systems were delivered to Ukraine. The U.S. announced in August that it promised another six NASAMS launchers to Ukraine, but it could be some time until they arrive in the country. A Ukrainian government source said the Ukrainian government was talking to all of its partners, including the U.S., about creating a ""comprehensive and wide"" air defense system ""all across Ukraine."" ""We're not talking about a few systems near the front lines,"" the official added. ""If we have this [comprehensive air defense] system, this war can end sooner and that's in all of our interests."" Last month, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark Milley called the project a priority. At a NATO meeting, he stressed that air defense systems would have to be provided to Ukraine by a number of countries. ""The task is then to bring those together, get them deployed, get them [the Ukrainians] trained, because each of these systems is different,"" Milley said. Last weekend, after weeks of denials, Iran finally acknowledged that it has supplied Russia with drones. However, Iran's foreign minister claimed Tehran only sold a relatively small number of drones to Russia and did so before President Vladimir Putin's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February. He also claimed that Iran had no knowledge that the drones were being used to attack Ukraine. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy accused Iran of ""lying.""",49,,,,13
2022-11-05,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/US/explainer-law-enforcement-responding-election-threats-country/story?id=92686448,Explainer: How law enforcement is responding to election threats around the country,"Election security is on the minds of many Americans in the run-up to the 2022 midterm elections. The aftermath of the 2020 elections coupled with an increased threat of foreign interference through election tampering, fraud, and intimidation have forced the federal government to create an election security umbrella that never existed before. That umbrella is, in large measure, coordinated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) with support from the Department of Homeland Security's Critical Security and Infrastructure Agency as well as the National Security Agency (NSA) and U.S. military Cyber Command. For the FBI, the threats can be in person, in writing, via phone, or made online. They can include: - Voter suppression, where bad actors spread disinformation about voting using various methods such as social media platforms, texting, or peer-to-peer messaging applications on smartphones. They may provide misleading information about the time, manner, or place of voting. This can include inaccurate election dates or false claims about voting qualifications or methods, such as false information suggesting that one may vote by text, which is not allowed in any U.S. jurisdiction. - Threats against election workers, which includes any threat to an election worker or volunteer that causes fear, danger or intimidation. - Voter fraud, by giving false information when registering to vote (such as false citizenship claims), by voting when ineligible to vote, and by voting more than once or using someone else's name to vote. - Election fraud, which includes changing a ballot tally or engaging in other corrupt behavior as an elections official; providing a voter with money or something of value in exchange for voting for a specific candidate or party in a federal election; threatening a voter with physical or financial harm if they don't vote or don't vote a certain way; and trying to prevent qualified voters from voting by lying about the time, date, or place of an election, i.e., voter suppression. - Campaign fraud, which includes excessive campaign contributions above the legal limit, conduit contributions or straw donor schemes, contributions from prohibited sources, cording between Super PACs and independent expenditure organizations and a candidate's campaign, and using campaign funds for personal or unauthorized use. The threats can emanate from domestic and foreign sources, including state and non-state actors and radical U.S.-based groups. In every case, these attempts are meant to sway voters and the election process in one direction or another. In August of 2020, then-Counterintelligence and Security Center Director William Evanina warned that China, Russia and Iran were attempting to sway American voters and influence the election. The same holds true today as these same state actors, once again, are trying to usurp the U.S. election process. To combat this, in addition to its broad partnerships, the FBI has created a robust and expansive election intelligence effort aimed at identifying and mitigating any threat to the election process. This includes the creation of the Foreign Influence Task Forces, which brought the FBI's national security and traditional criminal investigative expertise under one umbrella to prevent foreign influence in our elections. Additionally, as has been done in the past, on Election Day the FBI will spin up command posts across the nation that will monitor and respond to investigative tips as well as real time election issues. These command posts are staffed by investigators and analysts from the FBI and its partners, including local, state and federal law enforcement agencies, that coordinate and work together to thwart any evidence of election tampering, fraud or abuse. Since all alleged Election Day offenses get referred to the FBI for investigation and potential prosecution by the Department of Justice, the Justice Department will run a nationwide Election Day Program, where an assistant U.S. attorney is appointed by the United States attorney in that district as the election coordinator. All of this is in an effort to ensure that the election is safe and that any nefarious actors are identified and stopped, in order to protect the voting process. Donald J.

2022-11-02,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/divisiveness-grips-us-adversaries-exploit-dhs-secretary/story?id=92483297,'Divisiveness' that 'grips' US is something adversaries exploit: DHS secretary,"The divisiveness in the United States is something adversaries seek to take advantage of, especially during the midterm elections, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas told ABC News in an interview on Tuesday. ""The divisiveness that now grips this country is something that our adversaries, our adverse nation-states seek to exploit,"" Mayorkas told ABC News Chief Justice Correspondent Pierre Thomas. ""And they do that on online platforms."" The three main adversaries, he said, are Russia, China and Iran, which purposely attempt to sow discord ""in the American public."" The secretary was asked whether or not former President Donald Trump makes his job harder because people believe his falsehoods about the 2020 election. The secretary, while not directly addressing Trump by name, said the words of leaders ""matter"" and that the misinformation leaders perpetuate makes their job harder. He was also asked if DHS has a responsibility to neutralize claims of election fraud. ""It is the responsibility of government, not just the Department of Homeland Security, the responsibility of government. It is a responsibility of leaders. It is the responsibility of people in positions of trust to communicate accurate information to the American public and disabuse them of falsehoods,"" he said. Mayorkas, when asked, said he has not communicated with the former president about taking the temperature of the rhetoric down. Last week, the department warned in a bulletin obtained by ABC News that violent extremists could pose a ""heightened threat"" to the midterm elections, which are on Tuesday. ""The integrity of an individual's right to vote and to be able to vote with a complete feeling of safety and security is absolutely vital. That is the foundation of our democracy,"" Mayorkas said. ""Freedom of speech is a fundamental right in this country. That does not mean that one gets to scream fire in a movie theater or incite people to violent acts."" Mayorkas, who oversees the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), which is primarily in charge of securing the nation's cyber infrastructure during the midterms and beyond, said they are doing everything they can do to protect the vote, including by combatting misinformation, and that the election infrastructure is ""safe and secure."" ""I think what's important is that we will do everything that we can to protect the American public, to protect the integrity of the vote,"" he said, adding that there is no credible direct threat to the election. ""It is our responsibility as a country to make sure that the American public understands what is true and what is not, in the sense that we have to build digital literacy. We have to make sure that an individual who reads things online or otherwise learns to assess the credibility of the source and make decisions for themselves as to fact or fiction,"" he said. Mayorkas also said there are a ""number of forces that are fueling violent extremism, ideologies of hate, false narratives, anti-government sentiment, personal grievances."" The attack against House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's husband, Paul, is just one example of the moment the country is in, he said. On Friday, a suspect assaulted Paul Pelosi with a hammer after breaking into the couple's San Francisco home in what the district attorney called ""politically motivated violence."" The suspect is facing a slew of state and federal charges. Since Mayorkas took the job in 2021, he has been sounding the alarm on domestic violent extremism in the United States. On Tuesday, he called what happened on Jan. 6 a wake-up call, along with the assault at the Pelosi home. ""Let's think about that assault and the fact that there is not unanimity of condemnation and abhorrence in this country over that brutal act,"" the secretary said. ""It should be another wake-up call with respect to the moment that we're in.""",20,,,,1
2022-11-02,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/american-elections-resilient-vulnerable/story?id=89859386,Why American elections are resilient but still vulnerable,"This story is part of the ABC News series ""Democracy in Peril,"" which examines the inflection point the country faces after the Jan. 6 attacks and ahead of the 2022 election. America's elections system, though battle-tested and proven over decades, is facing a political environment in which public distrust has quickly eroded voters' confidence and threats to elections officials have raised new concerns. Voter confidence has wavered significantly following the 2020 election after former President Donald Trump denied Joe Biden's victory and promptly instructed his allies and supporters to demand the election results be overturned, leading to the violent events of Jan. 6. That, despite an election that experts called the most secure in the nation's history. Election skepticism stretches back years -- and, experts and polls say, is getting worse -- fueled in part by Trump's attacks on early and mail voting and before that, in 2016, doubt began to grow with reports of foreign interference. The reality, though, is that federal elections in America are hard to manipulate, nonpartisan experts told ABC News. Increased federal funding to support election staff and technological upgrades, expanded verified paper ballots and post-election audits, they say, along with electing public servants who fundamentally believe in the elections process, have produced federal elections that are mostly resilient. Experts from the Brennan Center, the States United Democracy Center and other groups who spoke with ABC News said elections succeed because of how diffuse they are -- any disruption would likely occur at the local level but not affect counting on a state or national scale. While fraud at any level is extremely rare, they say, there are more opportunities for interference at the local level because of thousands of different elections systems. These experts also said the election system's overall function and integrity falls squarely on the shoulders of one group -- elections officials -- from secretaries of state to election night volunteers -- who despite an unprecedented number of recent threats have mostly risen to the occasion to ensure accuracy and fairness throughout the process. Senior FBI officials told ABC News their election security task force has received more than 1,000 tips about threats to election workers since June 2021. Those threats were overwhelmingly through email, along with some others by phone and social media. Fifty-eight percent of the threats involved disputed election results, with roughly 11% of those more than 1,000 tips warranted further federal investigation. ""I'm not concerned about this upcoming election, because we have been relying on these public servants who really are willing to put partisanship aside, do the right thing to make sure our elections are reliable,"" said Gowri Ramachandran, senior counsel in the Brennan Center for Justice Elections & Government Program. ""But I would also say in the longer term, you know, we can't take those people for granted and we shouldn't take them for granted."" Elections in the United States, even on the national scale during presidential contests, are run largely at the county level. In some states, it's even more local, down to a municipality or township. Those on the front lines of elections are some of the biggest players: state and local governments, election officials, federal partners, and vendors. The top election official is usually the secretary of state, board, commission, elected or appointed individual, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Then, various levels of county officials, clerks or election boards who are tasked with designating polling locations and overseeing the volunteers who direct voters at the ballot box, run tabulation machines and observe lines, among other responsibilities, said Joanna Lydgate, the co-founder and CEO of the States United Democracy Center. ""The fact that election administration is so decentralized in the United States, it is an asset when it comes to election security, because it means that if there is some kind of disruption, often the impact of that is limited to just that local jurisdiction,"" Ramachandran said. ""It really severely limits the impact of any mistakes or interference that does happen."" But because American elections vary by jurisdiction, their safety and security also depend on the locality. Elections officials are typically trained through rigorous certification programs specifically tailored to their duties. In a state like Georgia, election superintendents provide training to all poll officers and poll workers regarding the use of voting equipment, voting procedures, all aspects of state and federal law applicable to conducting elections, and the poll officers' or poll workers' duties in connection to each election. Tina Taylor, who worked elections in Charleston County, South Carolina, in 2016 and 2020, said it was during her training that she really got a sense of how secure the voting process was in her county, given the number of different people and steps involved. ""How the voting machines are set up, there's no way that someone can cheat. I mean, we have so many checks and balances … you have to go through so much just to vote,"" she said. ""Everything is locked. Everything is calibrated, everything is numbered. Everything is initialed two to three times, witnessed by two or three people at the same time … I was just like, 'Well, I really don't know how someone could cheat.'"" Taylor's trust in the election process echoes what election security experts have long stated: disrupting federal elections in a significant way would be extremely difficult, if not nearly impossible. While mail ballots are more susceptible to fraud than in-person voting, it is still more likely for an American to be struck by lightning than to commit mail voting fraud, according to one Brennan Center report. ""Elections are run by states, but one thing that's consistent across the country is that state and local election officials have strict procedures in place to protect your ballot. These measures make sure that every vote is cast by a registered voter, and then counted and certified. Your vote is secure, no matter how you choose to cast your ballot -- whether you use a drop box, put your ballot in the mail, vote early, or vote in person on Election Day. We have a long history in this country of safe and secure elections. This year is no different,"" said Lydgate. Ahead of the 2022 midterms, dozens of state and local officials across the country told ABC News that preparations for the election are being hampered ongoing threats against election workers, but federal and state laws may provide protection. The nation's top intelligence and law enforcement agencies -- from the Department of Justice, Department of Homeland Security -- Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, U.S. Election Assistance Commission -- have confirmed the security of the 2020 election, saying there were no significant instances of voter fraud. The courts have also struck down cases alleging wide-scale voter fraud through legal challenges, Trump and his allies ""have failed to discount a significant number of votes, block the certification of results, or overturn the results of any race,"" according to a Brennan Center report. ""To date, [DOJ investigators] have not seen fraud on a scale that could have affected a different outcome in the election,"" said Trump Attorney General William Barr in December 2020. One of the primary resiliency measures employed in 2020, Ramachandran said, is that many election jurisdictions made significant progress on using voting systems that have verifiable paper records, allowing the ability to go back and count each ballot if necessary. Widespread mail-in voting added to that paper trail during the coronavirus pandemic, along with printouts of the voter's choices at in-person polling locations. ""The good news is that a lot of those are still in place, in terms of people's confidence in the upcoming midterms,"" said Ramachandran. There's also a promising trend of information sharing between The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (created in 2018) and state and local election officials, she said, with the federal government providing warnings and alerts to local officials, along with increased security at physical voting locations. Post-election tabulation audits, or checks on the equipment and procedures used to count votes during an election, are another foolproof way to ensure the safety of elections. This is already required in most states, including many battleground ones like Pennsylvania and Nevada -- states that have also been subject to intense voter fraud speculation from certain groups. Joanna Lydgate of the States United Democracy Center said that as she travels the county and talks with election officials, she's also encountered an ""incredible resilience and a commitment"" to the work, which is a promising trend ahead of the upcoming midterm elections. ""It's a very difficult environment right now in which to be doing these jobs. That said, I think that there is so much. There is so much resilience, and, you know, we saw in 2020 How good pro-democracy election officials from both sides of the aisle stood up and did their jobs under the most challenging circumstances,"" said Lydgate. ""You trust nurses and doctors with your health, you trust teachers, with your children's education, you trust a car mechanic with your vehicle. Election officials are professionals in the same way. They're trained to run our elections and we've trusted them to do that for decades."" Because elections are run at the local level, the process can also easily become subject to interference due to the vast number of opportunities for meddling among the thousands of different elections systems. Interference could occur through foreign adversaries, harassment and intimidation of election workers or even voter suppression measures, Ramachandran said, but because each election is conducted locally, those vulnerabilities would not affect voting on a nationwide or even statewide scale. ""Having so many different entities involved in elections … provides checks and balances, but it also provides more opportunities for interference,"" said Ramachandran. Taylor has been a poll worker at the same precinct in Charleston, South Carolina for six years. The 2016 cycle went off without a hitch, she said, with no recollection of fear and threats. During Election Day in 2020, she remembers a few Trump-aligned people who were not registered to vote at the location that showed up with aims to harass voters and poll workers. ""We had a couple of Trump supporters that came in. One in particular really took like, a couple of hours to get off the premises,"" Taylor said. ""She was trying to convince us that we were seeing things the wrong way … it was mostly mixed with QAnon and MAGA."" Taylor is not planning on returning as a poll worker at a time when South Carolina is seeing a mass exodus of election employees -- 22 South Carolina election directors across 19 counties who have left office since the 2020 general election. Two others have announced plans to leave at the end of the year, according to a new report by The State newspaper. And that's not unique to South Carolina. Another Brennan Center survey of nearly 600 local officials across the country found that one in five reported they were unlikely to continue serving through the 2024 presidential election. The problem is evident in places like rural Gillespie County, Texas, where all the elections officials abruptly left their posts just ahead of the midterm elections, or as large as in Georgia's largest county, Fulton County, detailed by former election worker Wandrea ArShaye ""Shaye"" Moss, who testified during a June 21 Jan. 6 committee hearing about her experience with harassment following false claims made by Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani. Senior FBI agents told ABC News that foreign governments, especially Russia, continue to try to take full advantage of lies and misinformation suggesting mistrust in election results. Russia -- now embedded in the U.S. social media ecosystem and elsewhere digitally -- is using technology to covertly push and amplify false narratives about the election, they said. While Russian counterintelligence operatives used to create false narrative content themselves -- they can now rely on lies about the election being told by Americans and U.S. organizations, the senior FBI officials told ABC News. The officials also said that China is beginning to use some Russian tactics aimed at undermining confidence in U.S. elections and in some cases is targeting state and local officials.

2022-10-31,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/ufo-report-week-incidents-unexplained/story?id=92303931,"Another UFO report expected this week, some incidents still unexplained","The enduring debate about whether UFOs are caused by extraterrestrial beings will once again be front and center this week as U.S. intelligence agencies will provide Congress with an updated report on UFO incidents over the past year. Meanwhile, it appears that other more recent incidents are being attributed to weather balloons, other airborne clutter, and foreign surveillance, according to a U.S. official. Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines has until Monday to provide Congress with its first annual unclassified update on Unexplained Aerial Phenomena, the new term for UFOs, that includes all new UAP incidents over the past year and any previously unreported incidents. The report was required by the 2022 Defense Bill that mandated that the DNI provide an annual declassified update and a classified annex by Oct. 31 of every year through 2026. The update follows the DNI's first-ever report released in June 2022 that listed 144 UAP incidents, only one of which could be explained. At a congressional hearing earlier this year Pentagon officials said that the number of UAP incidents under investigation had risen to more than 400. While it is unclear how many new reports will be included in the upcoming update, a U.S. official told ABC News that the most recent UAP incidents can be explained as a mix of weather balloons, airborne clutter, and foreign surveillance. But the official stressed that other incidents still cannot be explained. The official added that it cannot be determined who is behind the foreign surveillance but the most likely candidates would be China and Russia since they have the most interest in monitoring the U.S. military. ""There is no single explanation that addresses the majority of UAP reports,"" Sue Gough, a Defense Department spokesperson, said in a statement. ""We are collecting as much data as we can, following the data where it leads, and will share our findings whenever possible. We will not rush to conclusions in our analysis"" ""In many cases, observed phenomena are classified as 'unidentified' simply because sensors were not able to collect enough information to make a positive attribution,"" said Gough. ""We are working to mitigate these shortfalls for the future and to ensure we have sufficient data for our analysis."" Analysis of more recent UAP incidents is helped by the amount of information and data available as compared to older incidents. The U.S. official told ABC News that two of the three videos declassified by the Pentagon in 2020 and recorded from the sensors aboard fighter aircraft now have plausible explanations. In the ""Go Fast"" video Navy pilots are heard exclaiming how fast an object is moving above the water. According to the U.S. official, the leading assessment from experts is that what the pilots saw on their video screens was actually an optical illusion of an object that was not moving very fast at all. The illusion was created by the angle and height at which the object was viewed by the sensors as it moved above the water. The ""gimbal"" video taken in 2015 by a jet fighter crew that shows an object rotating in the clouds. The official says it's now believed that the object's strange movements and observed spinning was caused by the sensor aboard the plane that captured that image. There is no assessment for what is being seen in the third video commonly referred to as the ""Flir"" video that was taken in 2004. The general public's appetite for UFOs is sure to continue, and just last week NASA announced the 16 people who would serve on a new panel tasked with studying UAPs. Their report, based on unclassified information, is slated to be released in mid-2023. ..",20,,,,0
2022-10-24,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/International/top-ukrainian-general-discusses-war-russia-putins-nuclear/story?id=91989074,"Top Ukrainian general discusses war against Russia, Putin's nuclear threat: Exclusive","KHARKIV, Ukraine -- The commander of the Ukrainian Ground Forces warned that Russian President Vladimir Putin's threat to use nuclear weapons in Ukraine is real and that the West ""should be worried,"" but said his country is nonetheless winning the war. Gen. Col. Oleksander Syrskiy made the comments in an exclusive interview with ABC News' Chief Foreign Correspondent Ian Pannell in the eastern Ukrainian city of Kharkiv on Sunday. As the 57-year-old top commander of his country's land forces, Syrskiy has played a decisive role in turning the war in Ukraine's favor, first leading the successful defense of the capital, Kyiv, and then -- most recently -- masterminding the spectacular counteroffensive in the northeast that upended the monthslong conflict and threw Russian forces onto the defensive. The rare interview, airing Monday on ""Good Morning America,"" is one of the few times Syrskiy has spoken publicly at length and he described Ukraine's tactics, the importance of Western support, the threat of renewed attacks from Belarus and his determination that Ukraine will reclaim all of its territory, including the Moscow-annexed Crimean Peninsula. Ukraine's successes, however, have been shadowed by the recent threats from Putin that Russia might resort to nuclear weapons to reverse the course of his war in Ukraine. Syrskiy told ABC News that he takes the threats seriously. ""We are and should be worried,"" Syrskiy said. ""I do believe that such a threat really exists and we have to take it into account."" The urgency of those worries was underlined on Sunday when Russian Minister of Defense Sergey Shoigu made telephone calls to his counterparts in France, Turkey, the United Kingdom and the United States, alleging that Ukraine was preparing to use a ""dirty bomb"" on its own territory. Shoigu's claim sparked fears that Russia might be laying the groundwork to use a nuclear weapon and blame Ukraine for it. Following Shoigu’s call with U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III, White House National Security Council spokesperson Adrienne Watson dismissed the allegations as ""transparently false."" ""The world would see through any attempt to use this allegation as a pretext for escalation,"" Watson said. Russia's nuclear threats have grown louder as its position in Ukraine has become increasingly desperate, and Ukrainian troops now threaten to force the Russians to retreat from the key port city of Kherson -- yet another potential turning point in the war. Syrskiy is one of the minds behind the two crucial victories so far that have enabled Ukraine's stunning success in pushing back Russian forces. When Russian troops advanced on Kyiv in late February, shortly after launching the invasion of neighboring Ukraine, Syrskiy directed the defense that shattered Putin’s initial objectives. Then in September, Syrskiy led the counteroffensive in northeastern Ukraine that liberated thousands of miles of Russian-occupied territory -- a disaster for Moscow that forced Putin to order a military draft and, for the first time, raised the prospect that Russian forces might suffer a full defeat in Ukraine. ""Of course I think we are winning,"" Syrskiy told ABC News. ""Because, first and foremost, we are winning the psychological battle."" But the commander warned against complacency, noting the heavy sacrifices that success has required of Ukrainians. ""We have success on the battleground, but war is difficult,"" he added. ""There hasn't been any wars at that scale in Europe, or elsewhere in the world, since the Second World War. And we understand that this war is about survival of our people and our state, and this is why we have no other option but to win."" Syrskiy was given the Hero of Ukraine award in April for his efforts defending the capital city. But the victory in Kharkiv, his hometown, was especially personal. Cerebral and reflective, Syrskiy is also a military leader who prefers to see the frontlines himself, regularly visiting positions to personally meet some of the soldiers he is sending into battle. He told ABC News he feels that responsibility and has a ""spiritual connection"" with his troops. Although he was appointed to his current post in 2019, Syrskiy has helped lead Ukraine's defense against Russia since 2014, when Russian troops and separatist proxies seized parts of the disputed Donbas region, the predominately Russian-speaking industrial heartland of Ukraine's east. Syrskiy has a deep familiarity with the tactics of his enemy, having been trained in the same Soviet school of warfare. In the 1980s, he studied at the Moscow Higher Combined Arms Command School. Now, he's exploiting that knowledge on the battlefield. ""It's easier to understand your enemy's actions,"" he told ABC News. ""You can foresee what he might do in different situations."" But as a commander, like the rest of Ukraine's military leadership, Syrskiy has embraced a different mode of military thinking since even before 2014 -- adopting NATO doctrines that grant greater initiative to more junior officers on the ground and moving away from the top-down Soviet approach. ""Of course there was a change in mentality,"" he said. ""Understanding that victory is achieved not by increasing the number of troops, but by using them smartly."" Despite his familiarity with Russia, Syrskiy said he had not believed Moscow would go through with a full-scale invasion. Even as Russian forces massed near the border, he said he believed an attack would be limited to the east, though he still prepared for the worst. ""To be honest, I did not expect that scale and level of invasion from the enemy,"" he told ABC News. Now fighting in Donbas, Syrskiy said Ukraine's strategy was to avoid full-frontal clashes that favoured Russia's massed artillery and instead, steadily degrade Russia's firepower by hitting supply hubs while launching constant mobile attacks. The goal, he said, was to achieve objectives with minimal losses. ""We achieve this by reliably hitting the firepower of the enemy, their artillery, avoiding frontal assaults, emphasizing raids and manoeuvers, attacking from the flanks and from the back,"" he added. ""We create the conditions under which we can make the enemy nervous, start taking losses and abandon their positions."" The successful counteroffensive in the northeast led by Syrskiy has been hailed by military experts as a masterstroke that will go down in the history of warfare, alongside other victorious operations like the D-Day landings during World War II or the Battle of Saratoga in the American Revolutionary War. Ukraine's success relied on patience and misdirection, declaring a counteroffensive in its south over the summer which lured Russia into pulling some of its best troops from the northeastern frontline. Once Russia had thinned its defenses in the northeast, Ukraine struck, rapidly breaking through and causing Russia's lines to collapse. Initially, the northeastern counteroffensive had itself been planned as a feint to tie up Russian units, according to Syrskiy. But he said he realized while planning the operation that Russian forces there were weaker than expected, opening up an opportunity to deliver a blow that would have a much wider effect. ""When we were planning it, it became obvious to me that an advance in Kharkiv as an operation will benefit us most and will have the most negative impact on the enemy,"" Syrskiy told ABC News. ""I noticed it first in May during the first offensive operation around Kharkiv, when we managed to liberate 10 to 30 kilometers of areas surrounding the city,"" he added, before noting that it was only in the summer that the change in the balance in forces made the counteroffensive possible. A similar Ukrainian success now looks possible in Kherson. Russia has ordered all civilians to leave the southern city amid reports it has already pulled back some veteran troops. But there are also concerns Russia might blow up the nearby Kakhovka hydroelectric dam, which Ukrainian officials allege Russian troops have rigged with explosives, threatening to flood Kherson. Syrskiy declined to comment on the battle for Kherson, saying only that he believes ""in the success of our armed forces."" He said the threat Russia might also blow up the Kakhovka dam should also not be underestimated. There is also renewed concern around neighboring Belarus, from where Russia launched its failed assault on Kyiv and where it has recently again begun moving in more troops and equipment. Western and Ukrainian officials have said that, for now, the new build up in Belarus is small and more likely a feint aimed at drawing Ukrainian troops away from the south. But Syrksiy said he believes the Russian moves in Belarus do reflect preparations to try to move the fighting into new areas once again. ""Of course they are getting ready for escalation of the battle and switching the conflict to other combat zones,"" he told ABC News. ""They are getting ready for action aimed at weakening our groupings and, to my mind, the possible purpose of that would be to cut or degrade our lines of communication and supplies."" But he said by doing so, Russia again risks stretching itself too thin in the north. ""They risk stepping on the same rake twice and hitting themselves in the face,"" he added. Most experts believe Putin is preparing for a long war, hoping his military mobilization and the arrival of winter weather will allow Russia to stablize its frontlines and then outlast Western determination to support Ukraine. The possibility of Republicans taking control of the U.S. Congress in the midterm elections next month is also raising questions whether American aid will continue as strongly for Ukraine. Republicans are divided on the issue and some party leaders have suggested they might scale aid back. When asked if he was worried that U.S. support could dry up if Republicans win more seats in Congress, Syrskiy said he doesn't get involved in politics. ""I trust the government. I trust the people of the United States of America. I trust that our strategic partner will continue to help us overcome our enemy come what may,"" he said. Syrskiy said he was grateful to the American people for the aid, which he said played a key role in Ukraine's victories. Without U.S. weapons and ammunition, he said he couldn't even imagine how much harder the task would be. When asked whether he believes Putin would stop if Ukraine succeeded in liberating all its territory, Syrskiy said it doesn't matter and that the fastest way to end the war was for Ukraine to push Russia out as quickly as possible. ""We have no other option, we have to go forward, move straight to our state borders,"" he said, adding that victory would only be when Ukrainian flags were flying over all Ukraine's borders, ""including Ukrainian Crimea."" Syrskiy recalled seeing razed villages last week as he drove near the recently liberated city of Lyman in northeastern Ukraine's Donetsk Oblast. ""You can't look at these scenes without getting emotional,"" he told ABC News. ""You literally feel pain in my heart, in my soul, so certainly you want to deliver such a blow to the enemy that they can never get back to Ukraine.""",7,,,,11
2022-10-20,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/google-sees-chinese-iranian-hacking-election-cycle/story?id=91761304,"Google sees less Chinese and Iranian hacking this election cycle, they say","Just weeks away from the 2022 midterm elections, a senior Google official said Wednesday that the company hasn't seen the same style of hacking from groups backed by the governments of China and Iran as during the 2020 election. Speaking with reporters, Shane Huntley, the senior director Google's Threat Analysis Group, compared the current level of activity to past reports from the company that Chinese and Iranian actors targeted email accounts related to the campaigns for then-candidate Joe Biden and then-President Donald Trump in 2020. ""We haven't seen that this year,"" Huntley said. ""We're watching very closely.” ""It's so far relatively quiet on the hacking front,” he said. But, he added, outside groups remained focused on disinformation: ""There's a lot happening behind the scenes, but we haven't seen that sort of cyberattack nature that we've sort of have seen in previous years.” During the 2020 campaign, Google went public with what it said were documented attempts by Chinese and Iranian hackers to to compromise email accounts for Biden and Trump campaign staff. The efforts appeared to be unsuccessful -- but were a part of what federal government officials described then as ongoing attempts by foreign countries to interfere in domestic elections. (Both China and Iran have in the past denied accusations of cyberattacks on U.S. entities.) Of election security, Google's Huntley said Wednesday that major efforts were being made regarding that and disinformation. Google officials on Wednesday also offered a broader look at personal cyber security. Heather Adkins, Google's vice president of security engineering, told reporters that in the next five to 10 years, “We will see the death of the password.” She added that Google would continue to iterate on things like “security keys, passkeys that the authentication experience.” In May, Apple, Google and Microsoft announced a joint effort to expand support for passwordless sign-in across devices and platforms. “The reality is that everyone's gonna get hacked at some point,"" Adkins said. ""And the differentiator will become how quickly we recover from that. And you actually see that in Ukraine.” Noting the cyberattack on the American satellite company Viasat in the early days of Russia's attack on Ukraine, earlier this year, Adkins said the firm was “actually able to recover very quickly, quickly enough to put their feet back on the ground and then resist the invasion.” Huntley, the security official, said that Google has been able to to help Ukraine and Ukrainian government officials protect themselves amid the conflict, thus allowing the Eastern European nation to “take direct actions because we were actually able to help out.”",20,,,,4
2022-10-17,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/International/iranian-drones-russia-attack-ukraine/story?id=91620223,What to know about the Iranian drones Russia is using to attack Ukraine,"A wave of drones struck Kyiv and other Ukrainian cities on Monday morning, killing at least four and wounding several others, after one blew apart a residential building in the capital and other drones targeted thermal power stations across the country. The attacks appeared to be the largest drone assault unleashed by Russia on civilian targets since the start of the war. Russia launched 43 drones and Ukraine successfully shot down all but six, Ukraine’s Air Force said. The attack highlighted how Russia is increasingly turning to using attack drones built and supplied by Iran to bolster its failing war effort in Ukraine. Russia has ordered hundreds of military drones from Iran’s government, according to western and Ukrainian officials, as it seeks to fill gaps in its own drone arsenal and as it runs short of long-range missiles. Ukraine’s government said the drones used in the attacks were mostly Iran’s Shahed-136s, large so-called loitering munitions, which Russia is employing like slow, small cruise missiles. Iran’s government has denied it is supplying drones to Russia to use in Ukraine but their deployment has already been widely documented since September. Ukrainian troops regularly post images of their wreckage and the drones' distinctive wing shape makes them easily identifiable. The 11-foot-long, propeller-powered drones are relatively unsophisticated, according to defense analysts, but still pose a serious threat, particularly if Russia receives them in large numbers. The Shahed-136 relies on a small civilian motor and commercially available GPS systems, making it vulnerable to jamming and relatively easy to bring down, Samuel Bendett, an expert on Russian unmanned military systems at CNA, a Virginia-based security research group, told ABC News. Russian troops have taken to nicknaming the drones “mopeds"", he said. But while vastly slower than Russia’s advanced cruise missiles, they are still able to fly hundreds of miles, capable of reaching almost anywhere in Ukraine. Slow and low-flying, they can also be difficult for some air defenses to detect and intercept. Their 50 kilogram payload is also relatively limited, but as Monday’s attacks show, the missiles can still sometimes cause significant damage. The drones’ greatest advantage, experts said, is that they are cheap compared to conventional missiles. “The whole point of using these Shaheds is to send them in waves, to stress Ukrainian air defenses, to have them expend ammunition, to keep people on edge,” Bendett said. “It’s not about all of them making it through, it’s about just some of them making it through.” Russia appears to be using the Iranian drones to maintain a campaign of aerial terror aimed at sapping Ukrainians’ will to fight, some experts said. In particular, Russia is targeting Ukraine’s energy infrastructure, hoping to damage it as winter closes in. Monday’s attack again struck critical energy facilities, cutting hundreds of settlements off from the electricity grid, Ukraine’s prime minister said. The supply of Iranian drones is significant because Russia increasingly has insufficient missiles to keep up a daily campaign against civilian targets, according to Ukrainian and western officials. Most independent experts agree that Russia is unable to manufacture large enough numbers to replenish its stocks. But Iran’s drones may allow Russia to fill that gap, letting it continue its terror campaign and to degrade Ukrainian infrastructure. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy last week said Russia is seeking to acquire 2,400 drones from Iran. The Washington Post reported over the weekend that Iran has agreed to increase its supply of attack drones to Russia, citing officials. Iran’s weapons supplies to Moscow are also fueling tensions with Israel. Following The Washington Post report, Israel’s Diaspora Affairs Minister Nachman Shai publicly said it should start sending military aid to Ukraine. Israel has so far resisted calls from Ukraine to provide its vaunted ""Iron Dome"" anti-missile defense system and Israel’s government on Monday did not confirm it would send weapons. But Russia reacted furiously to the possibility, with former President Dmitry Medvedev on Monday warning that it would “destroy all interstate relations” between Russia and Israel. A senior adviser to Zelenskyy, Mykhailo Podolyak, blamed Iran for Monday’s attacks, writing on Twitter it was “responsible for the murders of Ukrainians.” Most experts said they did not believe the Iranian drones would be capable of fundamentally altering the military direction of the war, but that they could inflict daily death and destruction on civilians. Perhaps the biggest threat the drones pose currently is to Ukraine’s energy infrastructure. ""Even if it’s a 50 kilogram warhead flying in at a very high speed and it hits an electric power station, it can cause very significant damage. So I wouldn’t downplay that at all,"" said Bendett. But even such strikes seemed unlikely to break Ukrainian's determination to fight, he added. ""The cost could be substantial but it’s probably not going to change Ukrainian resolve,” Bendett said.",49,,,,13
2022-10-12,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/quickly-ukraine-advanced-air-defenses/story?id=91342252,How quickly will Ukraine get the advanced air defenses it needs?,"The United States and other countries are pledging to beef up Ukraine's air defenses following this week's deadly cruise missile strikes that struck Ukraine's major cities, but how quickly will they get there to counter Russia's missile threat? The larger, more advanced, systems Ukraine wants will likely take some time to arrive given the limited stockpiles in existing American and allied arsenals, as well as the length of time it takes to manufacture the sophisticated systems. The White House said President Joe Biden promised advanced air defense systems in a call with Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Monday and providing Ukraine with more modern systems as quickly as possible has moved to the forefront of previously scheduled NATO and Ukraine contact group meetings being held in Brussels this week. ""Systems will be provided as fast as we can physically get them there,"" Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin told reporters Tuesday following the meeting of the 50 countries providing Ukraine with weapons. ""We're going to do everything we can, as fast as we can, to help the Ukrainian forces get the capability they need to protect the Ukrainian people,"" he added. Ukrainian officials claim their existing air defense systems were able to bring down half of the more than 80 missiles that targeted Ukraine's cities on Monday but they want more advanced systems capable of targeting the low flying Russian cruise missiles used in this week's barrages. For the most part Ukraine's current air defense systems are composed of older Russian-made S-300 systems and thousands of portable shoulder-fired systems given to Ukraine by the United States and other countries that came from their existing military stockpiles. The portable systems have been effective against low-flying Russian military planes and helicopters, but Ukraine has repeatedly asked for larger air defense systems with more range and capable targeting ballistic or cruise missiles. The U.S. effort initially focused on replenishing Ukraine's S-300 missiles from the stocks of other countries that had the system, and then arranging for Slovakia to give Ukraine its own S-300 system. But with a finite number of S-300 resources available the U.S. and other countries shifted to providing western-made systems that could be easily resupplied to meet Ukraine's long term air defense needs. But those new systems will flow in slowly over the next year as they are manufactured. On Tuesday, Germany confirmed that it had shipped the first of four Iris T-SLM air defense systems to Ukraine that it had committed to provide back in June. In mid-July, Ukraine received at least one NASAM battery that it received directly from Norway. The NASAM or National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile System, is jointly produced by Norwegian company Kongsberg and American defense contractor Raytheon. With a range of 18 to 30 miles the missiles are capable of defending against planes, drones, helicopters, and cruise missiles. Next month, Ukraine will receive two of eight NASAM batteries that the U.S. has committed to providing Ukraine. But the additional six NASAM systems committed by the United States are being built from scratch and will likely not be available for at least a year. But the limiting factor will be the capacity of American and Western manufacturers to make air defense systems that will take time to make. Also speaking in Brussels, Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, indicated that the short-term effort would be on providing Ukraine with older systems that are more readily available. He noted that Ukraine has asked for the Hawk missile, an older medium range missile no longer in use by the U.S. military, and ""other systems out there throughout the world that are available."" ""A lot of the countries that were here today have a wide variety of systems,"" said Milley who said the challenge will be to link all of those systems into an integrated air defense system for Ukraine. Any further U.S. missile defense assistance will likely not include American-made Patriot surface-to-air missile systems that Ukraine has requested. There are only a limited number of Patriot missile batteries in the U.S. arsenal and there remain concerns about how Russia might react to their presence inside Ukraine.",49,,,,13
2022-10-12,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/International/deadly-russian-strikes-ukraine-sign-weakness-strength-analysts/story?id=91296759,"Deadly Russian strikes on Ukraine sign of weakness, not strength: Analysts","Russia’s missile strikes across Ukraine on Monday were a direct retaliation for the attack damaging the key bridge connecting Crimea with Russia, Russian President Vladimir Putin said this week. The bombardment was the largest against Ukrainian cities in months and focused heavily on civilian targets, killing at least 19 and injuring dozens more, Ukrainian officials said. It was also the first time the very center of Kyiv had been directly hit. But while the barrage was intended to terrorize, independent analysts said it underlined not Russia’s strength but growing weakness, illustrating its inability to shift the military situation in its favor. They called it a desperate attempt by Russian President Vladimir Putin to respond to critics at home but said the strikes would have no effect in reversing Russia's battlefield defeats. ""This is not, therefore, a new war-winning strategy but a ... tantrum,"" Lawrence Freedman, a professor of War Studies at Kings College London, wrote in a post his Substack blog of Monday’s strikes. The Crimean bridge that was partially collapsed by a blast over the weekend was a target with major symbolic and military significance for Russia. The bridge was an expensive physical symbol of Putin’s annexation of Crimea and a key supply line for Russian forces already under intense pressure in southern Ukraine. The attack on the bridge was a personal humiliation for Putin that underscored how badly the war is going for Russia. Russian nationalists were demanding a commensurate response, experts said. Russia's strikes on Monday were unable to hit anything comparable, instead resorting to bombing civilian targets without any military significance, including a university and a children’s playground in Kyiv, local officials said. ""The occupiers are not capable of opposing us on the battlefield already, that is why they resort to this terror,"" Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in a social media post on Monday. In the capital, for example, a Russian missile targeted a pedestrian bridge that crosses through a park and that’s only used for sightseeing. The missile missed the bridge, leaving it intact, but it did hit the surrounding park. It's unclear if that strike resulted in any injuries. Russia also targeted several power stations around the country that Ukrainian and Western officials have said are part of a strategy of destroying heating infrastructure as winter approaches. The strikes are designed to spread fear, but will have no impact on Ukraine’s ability to keep advancing in the northeast and south where Russia is on the defensive, several military analysts said. Russia is also running out of the long-range missiles it used in Monday’s strike, meaning it will be unable to maintain such intensity even short-term, analysts said. Pavel Luzhin, a military expert and political scientist, told the Russian independent news site The Insider that after Monday’s strikes, Russia already had insufficient advanced missiles to repeat such a large-scale attack. ""The 83 missiles that Russia used today, it had been hoarding for several months,” Luzhin, who writes for Riddle Russia, told The Insider. Russia produces no more than 200 advanced cruise missiles a year, he said, and upping production or buying them from other countries was impossible. Luzhin said Russia still had larger quantities of older, less advanced missiles and now Iranian drones, but these were not enough to have a significant military impact. ""Enough for terror, but not for anything more,"" he said. White House spokesman John Kirby said in an interview on ""Good Morning America"" on Tuesday that Russia’s bombing campaign across Ukraine didn’t appear to be enough to turn the military tide in Russia’s favor. ""It doesn't appear like they're going to do that,"" Kirby said. ""I mean, we don't know what the next steps here are for Mr. Putin. But you can see just from the--just from the reaction of the Ukrainian people over the course of the weekend, they're not backing down. They're not slowing down. They're gonna continue to conduct their counteroffensives. They are still active on the battlefield."" Greg Yudin, a professor of political philosophy at the Moscow School of Social and Economic Sciences, told ABC News the Russian hardliners were ""the target audience"" for Monday’s strikes. He said Putin was now fully aligned with the hardliners and that he would escalate further despite his military’s growing weakness. ""He doesn’t care about reality. He will push until the end. He will escalate further and further, hoping that perhaps the final escalation will make the opponent surrender,” Yudin said. He said, in Putin’s view, the real opponent he must force to surrender was the West. ""The hardliners have been demanding attacks on Ukrainian infrastructure for some time and they now have got what they wanted. But they will inevitably be disappointed with the results. The electricity will be turned back on, the rubble cleared, and Ukraine’s armies will continue to press forward,” Freedman wrote in a post on his Substack. Russia has been bombing Ukrainian infrastructure since the start of the war, hitting Ukrainian cities most days, but the number of its strikes has fallen dramatically since the summer, which is a sign it has to ration its limited missile stockpile, most military experts say. Short on missiles and pushed back from Ukrainian cities, Russia is often turning to anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles to strike ground targets in order to preserve its more valuable cruise missiles, experts said. Ukraine is also increasingly effective at shooting down Russian missiles. One of Britain’s top spy chiefs on Tuesday also said Russia was increasingly short on ammunition and supplies of all types. ""We know — and Russian commanders on the ground know — that their supplies and munitions are running out,"" Sir Jeremy Fleming, the head of Britain’s GCHQ intelligence will say in a speech he is expected to give Tuesday, the BBC and other media outlets reported. “Russia’s forces are exhausted. The use of prisoners to reinforce, and now the mobilization of tens of thousands of inexperienced conscripts, speaks of a desperate situation.” As Ukraine has routed Russian forces in parts of the country in recent weeks, hardline nationalists in Russia have been calling for Putin to adopt a total war approach that would destroy civilian infrastructure and flatten Ukrainian cities. On Monday some of those critics hailed the strikes. ""We must hope that this is not a one-time act of revenge but a new system of waging war,"" Alexander Kots, a prominent military reporter for the pro-Kremlin Komsomolskaya Pravda newspaper, wrote on the social media platform Telegram. ""Across the entire Ukrainian government. Until they lose the ability to function."" The Kremlin last week appointed a new overall commander for its Ukrainian operations, Gen. Sergey Surovikin, known for leading a brutal indiscriminate bombing campaign in Syria. Monday’s strikes may suggest the Kremlin may be shifting to a similar strategy of intensifying attacks on civilians in the hope of counterbalancing its military’s failures while also placating its most aggressive supporters, experts said. In a short speech on Monday, Putin said the strikes were in response to the Crimean bridge explosion and warned Ukraine more would come if it repeated similar attacks. “No one should have any doubts about that,” Putin said. But Ukrainian officials said the threats would not intimidate them, noting Russia has barraged the country since February and instead calling for western countries to provide more air defenses. Kyiv has pleaded for such defenses for months, and Zelenskyy did so again Tuesday at the G7 meeting. ""I thank you for all the help already provided. It is big, it is significant,"" Zelenskyy said Tuesday. ""But the Russian leader, who is now in the final stage of his reign, still has room for further escalation. This possibility of his is a threat to all of us."" Zelenskyy told the G7 that air defense systems are critical for peace to be achieved in his country. ""We have a formula for peace. And now, reacting to Russian terror, sham referenda and the attempt to annex our territory, we can apply the peace formula so that the terrorist state stands no chance,"" he said. ""The first point is defense support. Air shield for Ukraine. This is part of the security guarantees that are an element of our peace formula,"" Zelenskyy said Tuesday. ""When Ukraine receives a sufficient number of modern and effective air defense systems, the key element of Russian terror - missile strikes - will cease to work."" In a phone call on Monday with Zelenskyy, President Joe Biden pledged to continue support, including “advanced air defense systems.” The United States announced in July it would provide two NASAMS surface-to-air defense systems, although they have not yet arrived. Kirby wouldn't provide any more details on what more, in terms of air defense systems, the U.S. may provide Ukraine. ""Clearly, air defense is a need, and we're going to work with them on that going forward,” he told ""GMA"" on Tuesday, adding: “Clearly, after this weekend, air defense capabilities continue to be a significant need for Ukraine.""",49,,,,13
2022-10-11,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/International/ukrainian-officials-tech-companies-send-drones-front-line/story?id=91287422,"Ukrainian officials, tech companies to send more drones to the front line","LVIV, Ukraine -- Ukrainian and foreign tech companies are providing an array of tech and cyber support to Ukraine in its fight against Russia, Ukrainian officials and tech experts said, with some the country’s top commanders saying they plan to buy about 1,000 more drones. “Ukraine needs all the categories of drones: huge ones, small ones, kamikaze drones,” Ivan Tolchynskyi, CEO of Atlas Aerospace, a compact drone manufacturer, said at a conference in Lviv this month. The Ukrainian Ministry of Digital Transformation along with the General Staff said this month that they’d spend almost $500,000 to buy about 1,000 drones. Small drones have become popular in Ukraine “because every soldier probably wants to get their own drone on the battlefield,” Tolchynskyi added. His company has provided the Ukrainian army with about 150 drones and plans to increase the number of deliveries to “1000 by the end of this year.” Ukraine's cause is also boosted by non-combat drones and special equipment, such as the mine-detection technology and medical drones supplied to various NGOs by the Canadian company Draganfly. “We originally came to Ukraine with our medical response drone that carries about 30 pounds of temperature sensitive supplies - such as insulin or pharmaceuticals - for search and rescue battlefield missions,” Cameron Chell, president and CEO of Draganfly, said. While drones help defend Ukraine's skies and territory, the country also needs solid protection in cyberspace to repel attacks by Russian hackers. “On average, we register around 200 attacks every day. Sometimes it is 500 a day and sometimes it is 50, but it happens every day,” Oleksandr Bornyakov, Deputy Minister of Digital Transformation, said. “We may not see it, we may not know what is really going on behind the scenes,” Kim Zetter, a cybersecurity journalist, added. Yet according to NATO Cyber Defense Center Ambassador Kenneth Gears, “[W]e have probably seen what Russia has.” As troops in the battlefield don’t do anything without hacker support these days, Gears said, the “very poor results that we see on the battlefield from the Russian army are in part the result of failed cyber-attacks and cyber defenses of the Russian army.” But in Ukraine, the IT sector -- and cyber warfare -- seems to be thriving, industry officials said. “The IT industry is one of the most resilient industries in Ukraine right now, maybe the most resilient. We are able to perform very efficiently during these times,” Vitaly Sadler, CEO and co-founder of Intellias, an IT development company, said. Ukraine boasts an informal “IT army” -- a gathering of over 200,000 anonymous volunteers who are coordinating via the Telegram messaging app. This motley crew of 'hackers' performed online attacks on very sensitive Russian targets, targeting banks, civil aviation databases and even the Federal Security Service website. Ukraine may even conscript a few IT specialists fleeing Russia on the back of the partial military mobilization announced by Moscow on Sept. 21, said Oleksandr Bornyakov, the deputy minister of Digital Transformation, adding that the recruitment is likely going to be limited. “I don’t think Ukrainian society is ready to accept even 'good Russians.' We might consider this on a very personal basis after conducting complete research on each person,” Bornyakov said. Russian hackers are in a more vulnerable position once they leave Russia. “Right now, they are protected by the Russian government -- the NSA and the U.S. cyber command know many of them. And Russia is going to be focused primarily on its own defense,"" he said.",49,,,,5
2022-10-11,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/International/russia-desperate-position-uk-spy-chief/story?id=91323871,"Russia in 'desperate' position, UK spy chief says","LONDON -- Russia is in a “desperate” position in its war in Ukraine and is running out of weapons and allies, according to the U.K.’s Director of GCHQ Jeremy Fleming. “We believe that Russia is running short of munitions, it’s certainly running short of friends … Russia and Russia’s commanders are worried about the state of their military machine,” Fleming said in an interview with the BBC News on Tuesday morning. “The word I’ve used is ‘desperate.’ We can see that desperation at many levels inside Russian society and inside the Russian military machine,"" said Fleming, whose British Government Communications Headquarters has a mission similar to the U.S. National Security Agency. Fleming gave the interview ahead of a speech he was schedule to give to a London think tank Tuesday, in which he was expected to be highly critical of the Russian military’s performance in the nearly eight-month-long war. “Far from the inevitable Russian military victory that their propaganda machine spouted, it's clear that Ukraine’s courageous action on the battlefield and in cyberspace is turning the tide,” Fleming said in his prepared remarks, adding that, “The costs to Russia -- in people and equipment are staggering. We know -- and Russian commanders on the ground know -- that their supplies and munitions are running out.” Russian President Vladimir Putin has ordered a series of missile strikes across Ukraine in the last 48 hours in retaliation for an attack on the strategically important Kerch bridge into Crimea over the weekend, with Fleming arguing this will have depleted their dwindling arsenal. “Russia, as we’ve seen in the dreadful attacks yesterday, still has a very capable military machine. It can launch weapons, it has deep, deep stocks and expertise. And yet, it is very broadly stretched in Ukraine,” he told the BBC. He also took aim at Putin’s leadership: “With little effective internal challenge, his decision-making has proved flawed. It’s a high stakes strategy that is leading to strategic errors in judgement. Their gains are being reversed.” “And the Russian population has started to understand that too, “ he added. “They’re seeing just how badly Putin has misjudged the situation. They’re fleeing the draft, realizing they can no longer travel. They know their access to modern technologies and external influences will be drastically restricted. And they are feeling the extent of the dreadful human cost of his war of choice.”",7,,,,1
2022-10-10,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/International/inside-ukraines-counteroffensive-drone-warfare-small-group-hackers/story?id=91104098,Inside Ukraine's critical drone warfare campaign against Russia,"In a workshop in an undisclosed location in the southern Ukrainian city of Zaporizhzhia, a group of IT experts and engineers are assembling plastic components and soldering electrical wires. Bartek Kowalski from Poland, the only overseas member of an otherwise all-Ukrainian team, modestly joked that the intricate task he is performing can be learned by ""watching YouTube tutorials."" But the work of these volunteers is no laughing matter. They take drones that can be purchased on the internet and adapt them into fighting machines for the Ukrainian military. A custom-made fitting, designed in their lab, which is fixed onto the underside of a drone can carry a grenade that can then be dropped onto Russian positions. At the end of August, the Ukrainian military announced it was launching a counteroffensive in the south of the country. And, this week, Ukrainian forces appeared to be gaining significant amounts of ground in the Kharkiv region in the northeast. Yevhen Tkach is a biologist by trade who now spends the bulk of his time managing volunteer efforts to procure, adapt and supply drones to Ukrainian military units. He said he regularly receives information from military colleagues confirming the positive impact drones are making in the Ukrainians' ongoing operations to recapture territory. As well as their work to attach grenades to drones, Tkach and his colleagues are also taking other types of drones, and attaching explosives to them so they can be flown directly into a target in a kamikaze-style attack. His team is also working to fit certain drones with thermal cameras because a lot of the work undertaken by reconnaissance and sabotage units along the frontlines in Ukraine is carried out at night. As Yevhen Tkach pointed out, a drone is nowhere near as valuable as the life of a soldier, so the machines can access dangerous areas, acting as the military's ""eyes in the sky."" And he acknowledges that the Russians are ""really good at electronic warfare."" With the war in Ukraine predominantly an artillery battle, drones gather vital intelligence, allowing a unit to pinpoint enemy positions and assets. The location of any target is then passed to artillery units. However, soldiers who pilot drones are sometimes targets themselves. Before Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in late February, Oleksandr Trofymenko was an event manager in Denmark. He quickly returned to his native Ukraine and now serves alongside a former farmer, DJ and security guard in a Ukrainian drone reconnaissance unit based in Zaporizhzhia. Trofymenko and his colleagues are heavily armed and alive to the risks they face. ""As soon as we launch the drone the Russians are hunting for us,"" he said with a wry smile. Defending their own territory, he argues, gives units like his an obvious advantage. ""We know everything,"" about the terrain, he said. Trofymenko is grateful to the army of Ukrainian volunteers who support units like his with vital equipment and even weapons. Yevhen Tkach and his small group of engineers in Zaporizhzhia also hack the drones before they supply them to reconnaissance units for use on the battlefield. By hacking a drone, they rid it of any digital signature which could reveal a unit's location to the Russians. Holding his drone aloft, soldier Trofymenko confidently states that the Russians can't see it. ""This is the work of Ukrainian engineers,"" he said.",49,,,,28

CISA is the cyber arm of the Department of Homeland Security. The law enforcement agencies cite previous elections where foreign governments, without directly naming any, have attempted to influence the election and ""incite violence"" as a result of spreading misinformation. In the 2016 and 2020 presidential elections, the U.S. government identified Russia, China and Iran as election disrupters. ""Foreign actors can use a number of methods to knowingly spread and amplify false claims and narratives about malicious cyber activity, voting processes, and results surrounding the midterm election cycle,"" the alert says. ""These actors use publicly available and dark web media channels, online journals, messaging applications, spoofed websites, emails, text messages, and fake online personas on U.S. and foreign social media platforms to spread and amplify these false claims."" John Cohen, the former Acting Secretary of Intelligence and Analysis at the Department of Homeland Security said it is ""critical"" local, state and federal officials come together to ""understand the risks posed by these foreign and domestic threat actors and take steps to protect elections officials, workers and infrastructure from physical and cyberattacks."" ""As we approach the midterm elections, state and local officials face a number of highly dangerous election-related threats ranging from cyberattacks and information operations by hostile foreign powers to threats of violence directed at election officials and infrastructure,"" Cohen, an ABC News contributor said. ""The security of the nation depends on it."" In one example, federal officials say foreign actors might try and say hackers have compromised voter registration data -- that voter registration data is publicly available from state and local governments. ""These efforts by foreign actors aim to undermine voter confidence and to entice unwitting consumers of information and third-party individuals to like, discuss, share, and amplify the spread of false or misleading narratives,"" the alert says. ""The FBI and CISA urge the American public to critically evaluate the sources of the information they consume and to seek out reliable and verified information from trusted sources, such as state and local election officials and reputable news media. The FBI and CISA will continue to quickly respond to potential threats, by seeking to engage with state and local officials and the public when possible."" Earlier this week, officials from the Department laid out what they see as the biggest threats to the 2022 midterm elections. Among the ""big four"" areas of concern Jenn Easterly, the director of CISA says, are insider threats, threats from state-sponsored actors, physical threats and disinformation. ""Cybersecurity threats from sophisticated state sponsored threat actors, but also from cyber criminals, we still worry about potential ransomware attacks, insider threats from people with institutional knowledge and current or prior Authorized Access to equipment or sensitive information,"" she told reporters on Monday, adding they've seen examples of these activities but declined to provide any. ""We've seen some of this increasing physical security concerns which very sadly include unprecedented levels of threats and harassment targeting election officials and, increasing myths and disinformation about elections that that undermine confidence in our democratic institutions."" Easterly told ABC News that the challenges are ""interconnected"" and cannot be viewed individually, especially when it comes to foreign threat actors.",20,,,,22
2022-09-26,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/International/13-killed-russian-school-shooting/story?id=90518338,At least 17 killed in Russian school shooting,"At least 17 people, including 11 children, were killed after a man opened fire at a school in central Russia on Monday, officials said. Local authorities said at least 24 more people were injured, some severely, in the attack in the school in the city of Izhevsk about 600 miles from Moscow, making it one of the deadliest school shootings Russia has suffered. Twenty-two children were among the two dozen injured in the shooting. Two teachers and two security guards were among the dead, according to the region's governor. Police said the alleged shooter killed himself at the school following the attack. They identified him as a 34-year-old former student at the school. Russia's Investigative Committee, which handles serious crimes, identified him as Artyem Kazantsev, and posted a video it said showed his body lying in a pool of blood in a classroom. The motive for the attack was still unclear but the committee said it was investigating possible ""neofascist views"" held by the shooter, who in the video it released appeared to be wearing a T-shirt with a red swastika. President Vladimir Putin's spokesman called the shooting a ""terrorist act."" ""President Putin grieves in connection with the deaths of people and children in the school, where the terrorist act occurred. It was carried out by an individual who, judging by everything, belongs to a neofascist organisation or group,"" Dmitry Peskov, Putin's press secretary told reporters. The shooting began mid-morning, while children were in class. Video circulating in Russian media showed pupils cowering under desks and with blood stains visible on the floor. Police sealed off the school and emergency services could be seen carrying stretchers with the wounded from the building. The shooter was armed with two pistols, according to Alexander Khinstein, the chairman of Russia's parliamentary committee for information policy, technology and communications. School shootings have been relatively rare in Russia, but in recent years they have become increasingly frequent. In May 2021, a teenager killed seven children and two adults after attacking a school in Kazan, and in April this year a man shot two children and a teacher dead at a kindergarten in the Ulyanovsk region. An 18-year-old student killed 21 people and wounded dozens more after setting off a bomb in a polytechnic college in Kerch in occupied Crimea in 2018.",45,,,,7
2022-09-19,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/International/war-ukraine-reached-turning-point/story?id=90019956,Has the war in Ukraine reached a turning point?,"By the six-month mark of Russia's war in Ukraine, the conflict had become a largely static one, with neither side conducting significant offensive operations. Until last week. Following a surprising counteroffensive, Ukraine said this week that it managed to recapture over 2,300 square miles of territory from Russia in the Kharkiv region in the northeast, including the strategic city of Izyum. The move also forced Russian troops to hastily retreat in what Russia's defense ministry called a ""regrouping"" of forces. Some military analysts see the counteroffensive as a turning point in the war, marking a likely end to Russia's ability to mount any major offensives in Ukraine again, while others -- including President Joe Biden -- have said it's hard to tell if that is indeed the case. Retired Col. Steve Ganyard, an ABC News contributor, called the offensive an important victory for Ukraine, though he noted that the battle in the south, near Kherson, is still crucial. ""The frontline is thousands of miles long. The Russians still maintain most of the Donbas and they're still holding up Ukrainian advances in the south,"" Ganyard said. ""It's a terrific victory for the Ukrainians. It will bolster their morale. It will show that they can fight better than the Russians can and it shows how weak the Russian military really is. But it is just one battle. One tactical, one operational victory. The war is still far from over."" Ukraine's offensive in the north seems to have caught Russian forces off-guard. After publicizing plans for a counteroffensive in Kherson last month, Ukrainian forces also pushed forward in the northeast unexpectedly last week. ""They actually sucker-punched the Russians,"" Ganyard said. ""The Russians moved 25 battle groups from the eastern front and the northeastern front, down to the area around Kherson to defend, add troops. So this made the lines up north around Kharkiv very thin."" The Russians may not have thought Ukraine could conduct two major offenses, but Ukrainian troops attacked the weakened front and ""flew through the remaining Russian defenses,"" Ganyard said. ""It's very extraordinary,"" said. ""We went from a relatively static battlefield for weeks if not months, to this amazing breakthrough, stunning breakthrough that the Ukrainians were able to conduct and achieve up in the north around Kharkiv."" More than 6,000 square kilometers were recaptured, according to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Ukrainian officials said they have retaken control of several cities, including Izyum -- which had been used as the main logistical hub for Russia's assault on the Donbas region. While the offensive is seen as strategically important for Ukraine and a major morale booster -- with the opposite implications for Russia -- there's still a long way to go in war, Ganyard said. Zelenskyy has previously stated his goal is to take back all Ukrainian territory from Russia, which still occupies around a fifth of Ukraine's territory, according to the Institute for the Study of War, a Washington D.C.-based think tank that has been closely tracking the war. Retaking Kherson, a city on the Dnieper River, would allow Ukraine to sustain its economy, Ganyard said. While a Russian counteroffensive seems unlikely given how ""decimated"" its military has become, Ukraine could run the risk of becoming stretched too thin, he said. ""The Ukrainians need to be careful that they don't overrun their supply chain, that they don't have such catastrophic success that they themselves become too thin and stretched out in the areas that they've retaken,"" Ganyard said. One key factor in the ongoing conflict will be the winter and the challenges that may bring. ""Clearly, the Ukrainians have the momentum and they will probably continue to hold that momentum going into the winter,"" he said. ""The winter season changes everything...Who knows what's going to happen when things begin to get cold.""",7,,,,11
2022-09-19,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/International/bodies-found-makeshift-burial-ukraine-show-signs-torture/story?id=90143457,Bodies found in makeshift burial in Ukraine show signs of torture: Reporter's notebook,"It is a primeval scene. Neat rows of wooden crosses. There is little dignity for the dead in this makeshift burial site in the forest. Names are noticeably absent from almost all of the wooden crosses. Instead, they are marked with three-digit numbers. The true extent of the atrocities allegedly carried out by Russian soldiers and officials in Izium, a city in the northeasterly Kharkiv region, is still emerging. Izium was occupied by the Russians for nearly six months. In total there are 440 wooden crosses, but no one knows yet how many bodies lie in the ground in these unmarked graves. On Sunday Ukrainian forensic teams exhumed 50 more bodies. An official involved in the investigations told ABC News that 16 of those 50 victims were killed violently. One of the victims had been stabbed multiple times and four victims were found in the same grave, according to officials. By a large pit is a cross with words written in Russian: ""Ukrainian Armed Forces, 17 men from the morgue."" Ukrainian investigators told ABC News that one of the bodies of the men found in that mass grave had signs of torture. A forensic team dug up the badly decomposed body. Officials invited journalists to witness the exhumation process on Friday. It was immediately clear that the man’s hands were bound with rope behind his back. Bending down, in his white plastic overalls and boots, the lead investigator called out his initial findings. There was flesh missing from the dead man’s right arm and signs that his clothes had been burnt and he had a cut around his genitals. A very small number of the graves do have names and the dates of birth and death. There were graves of two young girls, ages 6 and 9. Local officials said some of the victims buried at the site had been shot and many of them showed signs of injury from shrapnel. They said the Russians ruled through fear. Images of makeshift prisons and alleged torture chambers are emerging. In the spring, Ukrainians uncovered mass atrocities in Bucha, near Kyiv. Russian forces had occupied Bucha only briefly but left behind horrifying scenes of chaos and death, leading to international condemnation of alleged Russian war crimes. Concerns are now mounting that if Ukrainians reclaim more territory from Russian forces, something similar may be expected again. For now, authorities will continue the grim task of trying to identify the dead. Despite evidence including satellite imagery, CCTV video and testimony by victims, some of it obtained and verified by ABC News, Russia has repeatedly denied accusations of war crimes, even on occasion calling genuine photos and videos of dead victims ""fakes.""",45,,,,7
2022-09-13,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/International/us-military-aid-helped-ukraines-stunning-offensive/story?id=89762501,How much has US military aid helped Ukraine's stunning offensive?,"Ukraine's stunning blitzkrieg counteroffensive in the northeastern part of the country has routed Russian forces and continues to make rapid progress, in some cases pushing back Russian troops back into Russia, U.S. officials said Monday. While they acknowledge that the constant flow of U.S. military aid and equipment has helped ""change the battlefield dynamics,"" the officials also have been quick to praise Ukraine's military for how it has employed the equipment on the battlefield and for anticipating what weapons it would need to eventually launch the offensive. While there are few details of the long-anticipated Ukrainian offensive in the south targeting the city of Kherson, the surprise Ukrainian offensive launched near the city of Kharkiv has led to a dramatic turn of events In a matter of days, Western officials believe, Ukrainian military forces have retaken as much as 6,000 square kilometers of territory in northeastern Ukraine once held by Russia for months, pushing eastward from Kharkiv as far as 40 miles. The Ukrainian advance northward from Kharkiv has come as close as 10 miles to the border with Russia as Russian troops hastily retreated in what Russia's defense ministry called a ""regrouping"" of forces. ""On the ground in the vicinity of Kharkiv, we assess that Russian forces have largely ceded their gains to the Ukrainians and then withdrawn to the north and east,"" a senior U.S. military official told reporters Monday. ""Many of these forces have moved over the border into Russia."" ""We also assess that Ukrainian forces have very likely taken control of Kupiansk and Izyum in addition to smaller villages,"" said the official. Both cities were important to Russian military operations in eastern Ukraine, particularly Izyum, which had been used as the main logistical hub for its months-long assault on the Donbass region. ""We've seen the Ukrainians use to great effect, the capabilities that they have across the battlefield to change the battlefield dynamics,"" the official added, referring to military capabilities provided to Ukraine by the United States and other countries. Since Russia invaded Ukraine in late February, the United States has provided $14.5 billion in military equipment, including Javelin anti-tank weapons, Stinger portable anti-aircraft missiles, howitzer artillery, and the long-range HIMARS rockets (High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems) that can reach more than 40 miles behind enemy lines. While that assistance was described by the U.S. military official as being ""incredibly helpful,"" the official directed praise at Ukraine's military. ""Much of the credit, if not most of it goes to the Ukrainians and what they're doing to employ these capabilities,"" said the official. A senior U.S. defense official complimented Ukraine's communications with the United States to anticipate what gear it would need against Russia, such as requesting howitzer artillery to counter what they expected to be an ""artillery battle the Russians intended to wage"" to take over the Donbass region. That was soon followed by Ukraine's request for a counter to Russia's advantage in long range rocket systems and its establishment of major logistical hubs and military headquarters far behind enemy lines. ""That's when we started focusing on the ability of providing the HIMARS and GMLR systems (the rockets fired by HIMARS),"" said the official. ""So, it is absolutely a partnership and in listening to the understanding of what they're seeing, and then seeing what we can do to provide them with capabilities to address that."" Last week, Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Gen. Mark Milley said that the United States had provided ""thousands"" of the long-range rockets fired by the HIMARS systems that Ukraine has used to strike at more than 400 Russian targets behind enemy lines, including ammunition depots, logistical hubs, and military headquarters. ""They've had devastating effect,"" Milley said in Germany last week. ""Russian lines of communication and supply channels are severely strained. It is having a direct impact on the Russian ability to project and sustain combat power."" ""Russian command and control in the headquarters have been disrupted and they're having great difficulty resupplying their forces and replacing their combat losses,"" he added.",49,,,,13
2022-09-12,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/International/ukraines-advance-northeast-turning-point-war-military-analysts/story?id=89750922,Ukraine's advance in northeast likely turning point in war: Military analysts say,"Ukraine's stunning counteroffensive in its northeast likely marks a turning point in the war and has profound consequences for Russia's position going forward, according to military analysts. The counteroffensive has seen Russia's frontline in the Kharkiv region collapse in less than a week, forcing thousands of its troops to retreat as Ukrainian troops have recaptured hundreds of square miles of territory, officials said. The defeat not only removes Russia's ability to threaten Ukraine's second largest city, Kharkiv, but also likely ends Russia's ability to mount any major offensives in Ukraine again, the analysts said. It also will have a major knock-on effect on Russia's capacity to hold its positions on the other fronts around the country. It means in the long-run, the war now favors Ukraine, they said. ""Ukraine has turned the tide of this war in its favor,"" the Institute for the Study of War, a Washington D.C.-based think tank that tracks the war closely, wrote in an analysis. ""Kyiv will likely increasingly dictate the location and nature of the major fighting, and Russia will find itself increasingly responding inadequately to growing Ukrainian physical and psychological pressure in successive military campaigns unless Moscow finds some way to regain the initiative."" That does not mean the war will end soon, the ISW wrote—Russia still occupies around a fifth of Ukraine's territory— and is likely to continue into 2023, experts said. The Ukrainian counteroffensive routed a Russian force that had been one pincer in an attempt to seize the whole of the Donbas region, Russian President Vladimir Putin's minimum declared objective for the war. Ukraine retook the strategic city of Izyum, which had been the headquarters for the Russian effort to advance in Donbas from the north. Izyum's seizure means an end to the Russia's hopes of taking Donbas, the ISW and other analysts said. A second Russian offensive group trying to advance from the south onto the city of Bakhmut has now ""lost any real operational significance,"" the ISW wrote. Russian forces were already overstretched as they tried to seize the Donbas region, which made them unable to significantly advance for months, and painfully defending against a Ukrainian counteroffensive in the south, the experts said. Russia has been unable to replenish its forces because Putin has balked at ordering a full mobilization or putting the country on a war footing, fearing that could lead to domestic unrest that could threaten his rule, officials said. As a result, Russian forces are increasingly numerically inferior to Ukrainian in some areas. The Russian-appointed head of the Kharkiv region claimed Monday that Russian troops had been outnumbered 8-to-1 during the Ukrainian offensive. The rout of Russia's troops in the northeast—that saw them abandon dozens of tanks and vehicles—means it now must redeploy reserves that it does not have to stabilize the front there, experts said. But moving some of Russia's troops already deployed on other areas of the front risks giving Ukraine a chance to repeat its Kharkiv offensive elsewhere, hitting places where Russia has thinned its lines, according to the ISW. One potentially vulnerable area is the city of Kherson and the area around it west of the Dniepr river where Ukraine has already made it extremely difficult for Russia to re-supply its forces. Russia is reeling from the rout in the northeast, its troops' moral will be badly shaken. The risk for Moscow now is that the failure in the northeast could snowball elsewhere, triggering a domino effect as its forces panic and loses the will to fight, Konrad Muzyka, director of Rochan Consulting, told ABC News. Without a mass mobilization, that is fraught with huge political risks at home, Russia has no hope of reversing the direction of the war, Muzyka said. ""It's a horrible position to be in and actually there are no good choices,"" he said. ""They have to decide. The alternative is losing the war."" ""As a consequence of the north eastern rout of their forces, the Russians now have very few (if any) good choices. Their positions in the east are compromised and require a substantial realignment of defensive lines and logistics,"" Mick Ryan, a retired Australian major general and fellow at Center for Strategic and International Studies, wrote on Twitter: The grim outlook for Russia is shared by Russian nationalist military bloggers, who have large followings on social media and are often embedded with their forces there. The bloggers are the most vehement supporters of the war, but recently have written highly critical posts about the Russian leadership, furious at how the invasion has been conducted. They have demanded the Kremlin call a full mobilization and put Russia on a war footing, warning it is the only way to reverse the direction of the war. ""Not to recognise that Russia is waging a war is the greatest stupidity,"" Yury Kotyenok, who posts under the account Voenkor Kotenok Z, wrote following the retreat in the northeast. Recriminations over the disaster in northeast Ukraine also erupted unusually on a pro-Kremlin talk show on the channel NTV. Boris Nadezhdin, a politician, told his fellow guests Russia now faced a choice: ""Either mobilization and full-scale war, or we get out.""",7,,,,20
2022-08-25,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/International/ukraines-volunteer-army-responds-russian-hackers-minister/story?id=88651955,"Ukraine's volunteer 'IT army' responds to Russian hackers, minister says","LVIV, Ukraine -- The largest power producer in Ukraine, which operates four nuclear power plants, last week survived what officials described as the most powerful attack on Ukraine by Russia hackers since the end of February. According to the Ukrainian nuclear agency, Energoatom, the attack did not cause any harm. At the same time, Ukrainians are hitting back at Russian digital infrastructure. In Russia, more than 600 online resources including the federal postal service, pension fund, online banking and video conference platforms were affected by Ukrainian hackers in this month, according to a statement by the Ministry of Digital Transformation of Ukraine. ""Cyberspace is a frontline of the 21st century, and victories there are as important as in actual battlefields,"" Mykhailo Fedorov, the Minister of Digital Transformation of Ukraine, told ABC News. He's responsible for establishing the so-called ""IT army"" -- a gathering of more than 230,000 anonymous volunteers who are working together via Telegram, an online messaging platform. Russia's assault on Ukraine has extended into the virtual domain as well as on real-life battlegrounds. And here the enemy is choosing very sensitive targets that could impact security for Ukraine, Europe and even the world. But Fedorov said his country's cyber security system was more than efficient. ""None out of over 800 cyberattacks since February 24 caused real losses for the Ukrainian economy, stopped the banking system or damaged critical infrastructure,"" he said. Some IT companies in Lviv, one of the biggest hubs for the industry, said they weren't eager to disclose their involvement in the country's digital defense efforts. Some in the Lviv IT community told ABC News it is a matter of a personal choice for members of their staff to join the fight. Stepan, a 41-year-old member of the IT army, spoke to ABC News but asked not to use his real name because of fears of reprisal. ""On the second or third day of a new phase of Russian aggression I saw the tweet from the minister of digital transformation about the establishment of a Telegram channel, and that was very helpful to figure it out, what exactly to do to help my country,"" Stepan said. He said he had no military experience and he spent all his time in front of his computer screen. Now, almost every day, Stepan and the rest of the unofficial Ukrainian IT army are being given clear online instructions explaining top targets and offering software they should use for the coordinated strike. As a programmer he understands that his input makes sense only as a part of a team effort: ""I am not doing a huge amount of work, but in general, when we are acting all together, our input is very useful."" ""I just start some applications and I am free for coffee, tracking the process from time to time -- maybe some new targets emerged,"" he said, adding that the IT warriors were not staying in front of their computers every moment of the day. He added, ""I am always analyzing and searching for some additional information. Why this particular target is important, who are those people to be affected by our interference."" When asked if he worried about the impact of his efforts on everyday Russians, he said that ""it is not the time for that, as I do not see any changes in Russian society during these months -- sure, it is not a matter of some rapid shifts in their consciousness. That is why we just have to keep on doing what we are doing."" The volunteer-based IT army's mission now is to hold the digital frontline of Ukraine while the regular cyber forces are still in the process of assembling, Fedorov, the minister, said. The country is countering Russian cyber-attacks on a daily basis, he said. Russia is weaker after at least 40 cybersecurity companies announced their withdrawal from the Russian market and suspended service for Russian clients, Fedorov said. ""As many software or hardware solutions just cannot be replaced by Russian-owned technologies, it takes time to develop their own solutions,"" he said. The minister also said he was is counting on international support for Ukraine, asking the international tech sector to share the newest cyber solutions and offer service and equipment, which can help Ukraine. ""We are showing Russia that tech is a future, and tech will win over large manpower and outdated tanks,"" he said. As a member of the IT army, Stepan said he believed that he is weakening the Russian economy and its sponsorship of the terror on Ukrainian soil. And he is not the only member of his family who is involved into the struggle. ""Together with my wife, who is also a volunteer, but in a different way, we are actively waiting for this war to end,"" he said.",20,,,,11
2022-08-24,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/months-fighting-war-ukraine/story?id=88700360,"After 6 months of fighting, what's next in the war in Ukraine?","When Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24, the conventional wisdom among many U.S. national security officials and analysts was that Ukraine's military would be able to resist only for a few days, possibly a week. But six months later, Russia's invasion of Ukraine has stalled as Russia's military capabilities have fallen far short of what they seemed on paper, and Ukraine's military, buttressed by a constant supply of weapons from the U.S. and the rest of the international community, has demonstrated it will fight hard in every part of the country. ABC News asked national security analysts and a senior British military officer to discuss how the battle in Ukraine has evolved over the last six months and what could come next. In February, when Russian troops invaded Ukraine simultaneously along multiple fronts, it appeared to be an effort to overwhelm Ukraine's military in quick order. But six weeks later the combined effects of Russia's poor military decisions and planning led to the tactical withdrawal of its forces stalled north of the capital Kyiv and a shift towards the Donbass region in the east. Since then, months of intensive artillery barrages and rising casualties have resulted in only small territorial gains for Russian troops and as Ukraine has prepared for a counteroffensive in southern Ukraine, the fight has already begun to shift to that region. And it has been a costly one for both Russia and Ukraine. The U.S. believes Russia has suffered between 70,000 and 80,000 killed and wounded among its military forces and in June Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky acknowledged between 60 to 100 military fatalities a day among his forces. ""I am guessing that some kind of a stalemate will develop in the course of the next few weeks or certainly by the cold weather,"" Michael O'Hanlon with the Brookings Institution, told ABC News. ""And then the question will be do the two sides decide it's time for diplomacy and maybe have some creative notions of shared sovereignty or putting off certain territorial issues for a longer term referendum?"" O'Hanlon speculates there could be a lull in the fighting in Ukraine this winter as both sides rebuild their forces for a fight next year, much as was seen during World War I. Retired U.S. Army Lt. Gen. Ben Hodges, an adviser with Human Rights First, told ABC News that Russia has moved into a war of attrition that it may not win. As the top Army officer in Europe, Hodges developed the U.S. military training program for Ukraine's security forces following Russia's 2014 invasion of Crimea. ""If you're going to do attrition, you have to have three things: You have to have a lot of people, you have to have a lot of resources, and you have to have a lot of time. And the Russians don't have any of those three,"" said Hodges. ""So, they've chosen, unfortunately for them, the wrong strategy to defeat Ukraine."" Hodges believes Russia's logistical supply network has been stretched to its limits and will be unable to continue to resource Russian troops over the long term and he is not convinced that the Russian people will continue to support the invasion as time goes by. ""There are a lot of things working against Russia in terms of time, and so this is why I believe that Ukraine is going to win, that they're going to they're going to be able to push Russia back at least to the 23 February line by the end of this year,"" Hodges predicted. Air Vice Marshal Mick Smeath, the defense attaché at the United Kingdom's embassy in Washington, is more circumspect about what lies ahead. ""I think Putin is probably shocked"" at the Russian military's performance on the battlefields of Ukraine, said Smeath, who releases a daily intelligence update consisting of unclassified details from the U.K.'s Ministry of Defence Defence Intelligence. ""I'm not in his mind, but I'm sure he is looking at even now his narrow objectives, because his military campaign is failing,"" said Smeath. ""And he is getting to a point where his troops are stagnating and he is making very, very insignificant gains whereas the Ukrainians are defending strong."" Smeath is confident that one thing that will continue for the foreseeable future is the flow of western military aid to Ukraine. ""All I can say is that as in the UK, I can certainly say the same for our American friends and all of our our partner nations, we will keep supporting Ukraine to ensure that Russia does not get any any further gains and Ukrainian protects her people,"" said Smeath. Russia's military was expected to quickly overwhelm Ukraine in short order given their vast inventory of weapons, a recent modernization effort, and a switch towards a more professional force instead of just relying on conscripts. But the last six months of war in Ukraine have exposed Russia's military capabilities and left them in a far weakened state as its battalion tactical groups consistently suffered heavy casualties ""I think I'm certainly in the crowd of people that overestimated Russian capabilities and also somewhat surprised at how poorly they have performed,"" said Hodges who attributes some of Russia's poor performance to corruption within Russia's military ""in the form of false reporting about numbers, shoddy equipment, zero quality control over things over how ammunition is stored, all the stuff, which are ways where you can make money if you're in in the system."" Russia's recent military modernization effort focused on the integration of its warfighting capability in land, sea, and cyberspace. ""In reality, that is not the case, they have not been able to do that,"" according to Smeath. ""They've been pretty incompetent and quite ineffective."" ""The Russians made some big mistakes"" that O'Hanlon said outweighed their numerical advantage in the number of troops and technology. To that point, O'Hanlon highlighted Russian plans to drive heavy military vehicles over fields that were not as frozen as expected that led to bottlenecks on roads that exposed them to attacks by Ukrainian fighters. While Russia's poor performance on the battlefield may have been unexpected, O'Hanlon pointed out that there were indicators given that were indications it could happen given that ""we haven't seen the Russians fight well on a large scale in a very long time."" And that includes fighting against a determined military force and population. ""I never doubted that Ukrainians would fight very well,"" said Hodges. ""We have been working with them since 2015. So I was sure that the soldiers would do well."" But Hodges acknowledges not anticipating ""the resilience of the Ukrainian population. ""I didn't anticipate how strong they would be in how they would deal with this,"" he said. ""I think Russia completely underestimated the fact that they are a sovereign nation and they were not going to be invaded by a nation that they do not want to be part of,"" said AVM Smeath. ""I think Russia completely got that wrong."" ""Russia has been I think pretty desperate and pretty ineffective with their campaign,"" said Smeath. ""They haven't achieved anywhere near what they wanted to achieve. "" And that is also due in large measure to the constant flow of weapons and ammunition to Ukraine being provided by the United States and other countries. Early in the war American Javelin and British NLAW anti-tank missiles had an immediate impact against Russian tanks as did subsequent aid packages of Stinger portable anti-aircraft missiles. O'Hanlon acknowledges that the emergence of American-made HIMARS rockets systems used by Ukraine to strike at Russian headquarters and ammunition dumps as much as 50 miles away has had a significant impact on the fight in the Donbass but he is not sold on the idea that they are a complete game changer. ""I think we should watch very carefully what's going to happen in these next few weeks because my guess is that we'll already start to see some limitations of what the new technologies are able to achieve for Ukraine and yes, some kind of stalemate, perhaps on better terms than exists today,"" said O'Hanlon. And Hodges believes that even more sophisticated weapons will be needed if the goal is for Ukraine to defeat Russia. ""I think if if we were serious about Ukraine winning, not just avoiding defeat, but winning then we would be pushing a significant amount of weapons, long range fires, they can accomplish what we're seeing now in bits and pieces,"" said Hodges. ""That's what would become decisive. That's what would help set the conditions for Ukraine to launch a successful counter attack",7,,,,1
2022-08-24,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/International/ukrainian-celebrates-independence-day-marks-months-war/story?id=88728029,Ukraine celebrates Independence Day as it marks 6 months of war,"KYIV and LONDON -- As Ukraine prepared on Wednesday to celebrate its Independence Day, residents of Kyiv, the capital, took to the streets to take photographs with rows of destroyed Russian tanks, which have become a symbol of Russia’s failed strategy to take the city. The Russian army may have failed in its early plans to replace the Ukrainian government, but a war of attrition has set into the country’s east, with analysts warning that the war may drag on for months or even years. Despite the presence of the tanks, the atmosphere in the capital this week has been mostly muted, residents said. But authorities have warned that Independence Day may bring renewed Russian strikes on the city, far away from the frontlines. The United States repeated those warnings, with Americans being advised to leave the country via private means. The U.S. Embassy in Kyiv said the State Department “has information that Russia is stepping up efforts to launch strikes against Ukraine's civilian infrastructure and government facilities in the coming days."" With the city on high alert and the country under assault, the overlap of the two anniversaries has proven to be a moment for Ukrainians to reflect on the meaning of their independence. Ukraine issued its Declaration of Independence from the Soviet Union on Aug. 24, 1991. The day has since been one of Ukraine’s state holidays, usually marked by a military parade. ""During these six months, we changed history, changed the world and changed ourselves,"" President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in a speech on Wednesday. ""And the whole world learned who Ukrainians are. What Ukraine is. No one will say about it anymore: it is somewhere over there, near Russia."" The Ukrainian public not only supports the struggle to liberate the Russian controlled-areas, but has said it believes that Ukraine will win the war, according to polling in the country, though reports suggest Ukrainians are more divided on how much territory taken back would constitute a victory. But it has also left a nation traumatized by war. Millions have been displaced and hundreds of civilians are killed each week, according to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. Humanitarians fear that the winter will bring more misery. There have been almost 1,000 verified deaths of children, according to the U.N., though observers say this number is likely higher. For many, independence now carries a new significance. “When Ukraine became an independent country, I was a little kid, I was only ten and at that time, I really couldn’t understand what is going on around, but I have heard many times from my grandmother about evil of Russian empire,” Andriy, 41, a musician, traumatologist and radio anchor from Lviv who now serves as a medic on the southern front, told ABC News. “When [the] Russian war exploded with more power on February 24, now I understand independence of Ukraine as [an] absolutely new thing.” German, a 59-year-old Kyiv resident, said there is a new clarity about what it means to be an independent country on the eve of the anniversary. “Until February 24, 2022, there was no clearly formed understanding of independence,” he told ABC News. “After the start of the war, the vision was as follows: independence is free people hardened into a nation that moves its state forward.” For some of the displaced, being forced to flee from the east has uprooted their sense of local identity and connection to home, even if they believe in Ukraine’s ultimate victory. “Maybe now I will sound in a stupid way, but I don't want to adapt, to adjust,” Yana, a 32-year-old who left the city of Kharkiv in March to the comparatively safe western city of Lviv, told ABC News. “No, not because I'm somehow abnormal, just because I don't have a sense of home anywhere… Lviv is a wonderful city, and Vinnytsia, and Poltava, and Kremenchuk, and all other cities, but my home is not there.” “What has changed now, every minute of our existence, we need to prove and fight for our independence,” she said. “Which until February 24 was a common thing and understandable to everyone.” For many Ukrainians, the war has changed not just their understanding of independence, but their entire lives, forever. “Adaptation is very simple,” German said. “It will never be the same again, as it was before. So I do what I can for the victory.”",47,,,,1
2022-08-23,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/International/months-invasion-endgame-ukraine/story?id=88210112,"6 months into invasion, what is the endgame in Ukraine?","Wednesday marks six months since Russia invaded Ukraine. In the months since Russia's blitzkrieg attack from the north and east, which was met with a stronger-than-expected resistance from the outmanned and outgunned Ukrainians, the evolving conflict has become more of a ""static war"" with no clear winners, according to ABC News contributor retired Col. Steve Ganyard. ""At this stage, both countries, both Ukraine and Russia, seem to be losing,"" Ganyard said. ""And now the fight is obviously who can lose first and who will have to lose last."" It's impossible to predict how much longer the war will last -- it could be months or even years, Ganyard said. ""This is a war that's unfolding at this point very, very slowly,"" he said. ""Neither side has the ability to conduct significant offensive operations."" How long the fighting continues until one side ""loses first"" will likely depend on a few factors. For Russia, getting troops on the ground to maintain the territory it's taken is one, as recruiting personnel has been a challenge, Ganyard said. The Russian military hasn't given an official update on casualties since late March, when it reported around 1,350. One U.S. Department of Defense official estimated earlier this month that at least 70,000 Russians have been killed or wounded since the start of the war. ""There's a lot of fog in war, but, you know, I think it's safe to suggest that the Russians have probably taken 70 or 80,000 casualties in less than six months,"" Colin Kahl, the undersecretary for defense for policy at the Department of Defense, told reporters. Russian President Vladimir Putin has a ""very difficult chore"" to recruit qualified military personnel to fight in Ukraine, Ganyard said. ""The Russians are basically recruiting out of prisons at this point,"" he said. ""They have not mobilized the whole nation."" The number of Ukrainian soldiers killed since Feb. 24 is classified, but deputy minister of defense Hanna Maliar has said there are ""thousands."" There have also been thousands of civilian casualties; the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights estimates that over 5,500 have been killed and over 7,600 injured in Ukraine since Feb. 24. For Ukraine, continued support from the West will be key, Ganyard said, including supplies of precision weapons such as the long-range High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems, or HIMARs, which Ukrainian forces have used to wear down Russians in rear areas. ""The ability for the Ukrainians to target very precise locations -- command posts, supply depots -- this allows the Ukrainians to begin to attrite and wear down the Russians in their rear areas, take away the supplies that they're using to conduct this war,"" Ganyard said. This development is ""unprecedented"" so far in the conflict, he said. ""Up to this point, the war had been basically a slugfest -- artillery against artillery,"" he said. ""But now that the Ukrainians have this long-range capability where they can hit very precise coordinates, it gives them an offensive advantage."" Though as the conflict continues, there is a risk for Ukraine that Western support could wane as the impacts of the war, such as from energy supplies in Europe, are felt in the months ahead, he said. How much more of a beating their contracted economies can withstand will be a factor for both countries, Ganyard said. ""As we see both economies get drawn down, as we see both militaries being punished and diminished, it's going to be a question of who can survive and who can lose last,"" he said. Morale also continues to be crucial, with Ukraine buoyed by its offensive advantage while Russia looks to hold ground in hostile territory, he said. For Kahl, ""Ukrainian morale and will to fight is unquestioned and much higher, I think, than the average morale and will to fight on the Russian side,"" he told reporters. ""I think that gives the Ukrainians a significant advantage."" With those factors in consideration, there are several ways the conflict could potentially play out: In a ""best-case scenario"" for Russia, its troops will continue to gain incrementally in the Donbas and hold their ground against Ukrainian forces, Ganyard said. If Ukraine doesn't have the arsenal to push back or can't hold out amid a downhill economy, that could put them in a position to sue for peace, he said. ""Where the Russians are pushing in from the east toward the west, that is the bread basket of Ukraine,"" Ganyard said. ""That is where not only most of the industry is, but it's where most of the agriculture, very rich agricultural area, all of that gets transported down the Dnipro River. ""If Russia would be able to hang on to that, it would almost cut Ukraine in half, and certainly cut the Ukrainian economy by more than half,"" he continued. If Ukraine manages to recapture some of the territory in the Donbas claimed by Russian forces since the invasion started, that could pressure Putin to end the invasion to stave off further embarrassment, Ganyard said. ""If he began to lose, if he began to take even heavier losses, if the Ukrainians were able to recapture parts of Ukraine that the Russians have taken, at some point Putin may decide to cut his losses and declare victory and take whatever's left on the table in terms of the territory that he's taken thus far,"" Ganyard said. Alternately, Putin may push back against the political embarrassment of losing territory it had gained since the start of the invasion, Ganyard said. ""The more gains that the Ukrainians make, it's actually going to make the whole situation more dangerous because Putin may react in a way that escalates to de-escalate,"" Ganyard said. ""We've heard that term in the past, and usually that refers to the use of tactical battlefield nuclear weapons. ""The danger here is if the Ukrainians continue to do better, what does Putin do to save himself to save his beloved, domestic political position?"" he continued. ""Does he do something that would shock the whole world and try to scare the Ukrainians into an early surrender?"" Kherson, a port city on the north of the Crimean Peninsula, was the first major city to fall after Russia launched its invasion. The city is key to Ukraine for its access to the Black Sea and ability to move goods. If Ukraine manages to make ground and pushes past Kherson and threatens Russia-annexed Crimea, that could give Ukraine a negotiating advantage, Ganyard said. ""[Ukrainian President Volodymyr] Zelenskyy will continue to try to threaten Crimea to be able to pressure Putin,"" he said. That could look like threatening to turn off the freshwater supplies into Crimea, he said. ""There's all sorts of unknowns here about what happens,"" Ganyard said. ""As they go into the fall and into the winter, there may be some movement in terms of the negotiations. But at this point, neither side can afford to give up the kinds of military actions that we see on the ground to this point.""",7,,,,20
2022-08-22,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/International/russia-ukraine-conflict-continues-impact-civilians/story?id=88210989,How the Russia-Ukraine conflict continues to impact civilians,"Six months into Russia's invasion, a humanitarian crisis continues to unfold in Ukraine, as millions have been displaced and thousands killed during the conflict. With no immediate end in sight to the fighting, humanitarian aid responders are fearful that winter will only bring further suffering for Ukrainian citizens already afflicted by six months of war. Hundreds of civilians are killed or wounded each week, primarily due to explosive weapons, such as shelling from air strikes and missiles, according to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, which has been verifying civilian casualties since the start of the invasion. “Civilians continue to pay too high a price in this war,"" the U.N.'s political and peacebuilding chief, Rosemary DiCarlo, said in remarks to the U.N. Security Council in June. By the U.N's most recent count, as of Aug. 21, there have been over 13,400 verified civilian casualties in Ukraine since Feb. 24, including nearly 1,000 children. So far over 5,500 civilians have been killed and over 7,800 injured, according to the U.N., though those numbers are likely considerably higher. ""There are some black holes,"" Matilda Bogner, head of the U.N. Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine, told ABC News. ""For example Mariupol, which went through very severe, very heavy hostilities and connections were cut off. For a period of time it was not possible to speak to people there. It was very difficult to get full information."" March has so far seen the highest number of civilian injuries and deaths -- on a ""much larger scale"" than the most intense fighting after Russian forces invaded eastern Ukraine in 2014, Bogner said. A U.N. report found that from 2014 to 2016, up to 2,000 civilians were killed in Ukraine due to the conflict with Russia. ""While we don't know the full extent, I think we have a fairly clear picture and it means that a lot of civilians are suffering,"" Bogner said of this latest conflict. The U.N. has raised concerns that the high number of civilian casualties indicates that Russia is not complying with international humanitarian law. In one of the deadliest assaults on civilians, hundreds of people who were taking refuge in a theater in the besieged port city of Mariupol were killed in an air strike in March. Amnesty International called the act a ""clear war crime"" by Russian forces. In Kramatorsk, in eastern Ukraine, dozens were killed in a rocket strike on a train station that was being used for civilian evacuations. Amnesty International said it has also documented evidence that Russian forces executed civilians in Ukraine in apparent war crimes, which Russia has denied. According to the World Health Organization, there have been 445 attacks related to health care in Ukraine reported between Feb. 24 and Aug. 11 -- including against health facilities, as well as personnel and patients. Such attacks violate international humanitarian law, which has a higher level of protection for medical establishments, Bogner said. They may have helped contribute to the high number of civilian deaths reported in March, she said, if injured civilians were unable to seek care. The attacks also prevent people from accessing regular health care, including for chronic conditions, and child vaccinations, Marysia Zapasnik, Ukraine country director for the humanitarian aid organization International Rescue Committee, told ABC News. ""That will have a lasting impact,"" Zapasnik said. ""Their health care system is really overstretched at the moment."" Schools have also been impacted during the war. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said more than 2,000 educational institutions in Ukraine, including kindergartens, schools and universities, have been destroyed in Russian air strikes. September means the beginning of the new school year, though many schools are not in a position to open because they do not have a bomb shelter or they've been damaged, Bogner said. ""One reason why see so many schools attacked is that we have documented armed forces from both sides using schools as bases,"" Bogner said. ""That then means it becomes a legitimate object for the other side to attack. So this is certainly something that we discourage."" For Ukrainians, the past six months have been filled with stress and anxiety. ""A lot of families' coping mechanisms are being stretched now to breaking points,"" Zapasnik said. ""There are air raid sirens here on a regular basis,"" said Zapasnik, who is based in Odesa. ""The level of psychosocial stress is quite high across the country, but specifically in the east and south."" Women and children, who are often the most vulnerable in conflict situations, may be in particular need of support, she said. ""Dealing with things such as family separation, death of a loved one, going through a lot of stress, fear, a sense of helplessness,"" she said. Families may also be stressed financially, especially if they've lost their livelihood during the war, she said. Millions of civilians are also without sufficient access to necessities, such as food, water and power sources. As of Aug. 3, UNICEF estimates that nearly 16 million people need humanitarian assistance due to the crisis. ""This continued war in Ukraine is causing extreme civilian harm,"" Zapasnik said. ""Apart from the civilian deaths and injuries ... the war is also leaving millions without sufficient access to food, water, power sources, health care and other essential items."" The International Rescue Committee expects the number of those in need of humanitarian assistance to ""increase dramatically"" in the winter months, as civilians continue to be displaced and there is no electricity when temperatures plunge, Zapasnik said. Humanitarian aid organizations are starting to plan for winter now due to challenging supply chain logistics, Zapasnik said, so that they're not caught flatfooted in their response. ""Currently what I'm most concerned about is the winter,"" Zapasnik said.",47,,,,7
2022-08-12,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/International/wanted-off-skin-ukrainian-women-recount-rape-russian/story?id=86994779,'I wanted to take off my skin': Ukrainian women recount rape by Russian soldiers,"The three Russian soldiers arrived at Victoria's house claiming they needed to seize her cell phone. But they weren't looking for phones. Victoria, a 42-year-old Ukrainian woman, told ABC News she and another woman, a neighbor, were raped by two of the Russian soldiers occupying her village near Kyiv in March. ABC News spoke to the two women who agreed to talk about what they say happened to them, on condition that their location and last names not be revealed. Another soldier, a commanding officer who was not involved in the assault, threatened Victoria, she says. ""He looked at me and said, 'You see, our boys have had a drink and want to have fun,'"" Victoria recounts. ""I understood that something terrible would happen."" Two of the soldiers took the women to a house converted into headquarters for the Russian occupiers and raped them, they say. That neighbor, 44-year-old Natalya, recounted the events to ABC News. ""He says, 'do you want everything to be fine with your son? So get upstairs and do as I tell you,'"" Natalya recalled, describing her encounter with one of the Russian soldiers she says raped her. ""He was like an animal…And that rifle was hanging around and swinging."" Natalya says she later learned the soldiers killed her husband after she was taken away. Its unclear how many soldiers or which ones were involved in the killing. The family buried her husband the next day. The two Russian soldiers the women say raped them have not yet been identified but face international arrest warrants, according to Kateryna Duchenko, the Ukrainian prosecutor in charge of sexual violence cases committed by Russian soldiers. Both cases are being investigated with slim chances of the suspects being taken under custody or doing any prison time, she said. Stories of rape and other atrocities at the hands of Russian troops are not unheard of in small towns and suburbs of Kyiv. Residents of Bucha and Borodyanka have reported human rights violations including rape, murder and torture by Russian forces during the invasion. Russian authorities have not responded to ABC News' requests for comment on the cases. ""The last case [we identified] was in occupied territory of Zaporizhzhia region, where allegedly 10 Russian soldiers raped a woman,"" Duchenko said. Communication with residents inside Russian-occupied territories is extremely difficult, making the investigation and prosecution of these cases nearly impossible, Duchenko said. ""We know she is alive and that she had medical treatment and those details are all we've got,"" Duchenko said on the limited information in the case in Zaporizhzhia. The United Nations reported in June it had collected 124 reports of alleged acts of conflict-related sexual violence but qualified that number as ""the tip of the iceberg"" and added that it did ""not reflect the scale of sexual violence in the context of Russia's war against Ukraine."" Victoria and Natalya say they are now undergoing counseling with a psychologist about their trauma. ""I wanted to take off my skin and throw it away,"" Victoria says. ""The person I was before the war is no longer there. I became more aggressive. I began to fight more for my own."" Natalya says she is still coming to terms with the assault. ""Many people have asked me, why aren't you crying, why haven't you gone crazy?"" she said. In June, Ukrainian authorities said they opened the first trial on sexual violence committed by a Russian soldier, according to the Kyiv Post. The suspect will be tried in absentia. Duchenko's office says it is working on prosecuting two other cases of sexual violence committed by Russian soldiers in addition to the case opened in June. The suspects will also be tried in absentia, since they are not in Ukrainian custody.",45,,,,7
2022-07-18,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/International/ukrainians-forcibly-deported-russian-filtration-camps/story?id=86898080,Ukrainians are being forcibly deported to Russian 'filtration camps',"Eduard Mkrtchian, injured during Russian shelling of the Ukrainian city of Mariupol, said he was forced to evacuate and, at a Russian-controlled checkpoint, said he was given false information and forced to travel into Russia. He told officials he wanted to go to western Ukraine, to a city called Zaporizhzhia, but was told “there's no Zaporizhzhia anymore,” he said in an interview with ABC News’ Ines de La Cuetara. Instead, he was brought to a so-called “filtration camp,” a checkpoint in Russian-controlled areas of Ukraine where reports have emerged of people being interrogated for hours, their biometric data being recorded and their photos on their phones wiped. He said he was repeatedly misled, and brought deeper and deeper into Russia. “I was deceivingly taken to Russia,” he told ABC News. The U.S. Department of State estimates that between 900,000 and 1.6 million Ukrainian citizens, including 260,000 children, have been “interrogated, detained, and forcibly deported” to Russia, adding that “the unlawful transfer and deportation of protected persons is a grave breach of the Fourth Geneva Convention on the protection of civilians and is a war crime.” There are at least 18 “filtration camps” that have been set-up along the Russia-Ukraine border, according to Michael Carpenter, the U.S. ambassador to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. During his interrogation, Mkrtchian says, “they asked me to undress. They asked me the meaning of every tattoo on my body. They deliberated a long time whether or not to let me go. I realized that they could kill me here,” he said. “You have to fill out a form. There are different questions. For example - do you have relatives in the armed forces of Ukraine, do you know about the location of Ukrainian military bases, and so on,” said Mariupol resident Ruslan Bojko, who says he spent four days at a “filtration camp.” ABC News spoke with Bojko on a reappropriated cruise ship in Tallinn, Estonia, that now houses more 1,800 Ukrainian refugees. “These people don’t have a choice, they have to comply,” Tanya Lokshina, Europe and Central Asia associate director for Human Rights Watch, told ABC News. “The de facto choice, the only option that they have, is to remain in the streets and die under shelling."" According to a statement released on Wednesday by the U.S. Department of State, “evidence is mounting that Russian authorities are also reportedly detaining or disappearing thousands of Ukrainian civilians who do not pass ‘filtration.’” ""There are very strong grounds to believe that those individuals detained by them experience ill treatment and even torture,"" said Lokshina. ""The woman who was sitting next to me in the filtration camp, her husband had been gone for two weeks. He was taken away for filtration and not returned. There were at least 10 women I spoke with who had similar stories,” said Mkrtchian. Russia has acknowledged that it is resettling Ukrainian refugees, yet claims it is for ""humanitarian"" reasons. After spending time in a refugee camp in Russia, Mkrtchian eventually traveled across Russia to Estonia where he now lives, awaiting the opportunity to return to Ukraine. “How can I stay in a country that destroyed my life?” he said.",45,,,,7
2022-07-07,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/fbi-director-calls-china-biggest-us-threat-authorities/story?id=86336590,FBI director calls China 'biggest' US threat; authorities warn of North Korean cyber attacks,"Speaking alongside his British counterpart in London on Wednesday, FBI Director Christopher Wray called China the ""biggest long-term threat"" to both the U.S. and the U.K. ""The Chinese government is set on stealing your technology -- whatever it is that makes your industry tick -- and using it to undercut your business and dominate your market,"" Wray said while giving remarks to international business leaders. ""And they're set on using every tool at their disposal to do it."" Wray also warned of potential tactics by Chinese officials, saying they steal technology by using intelligence officers to ""target"" valuable pieces of information and companies. ""We've even caught people affiliated with Chinese companies out in the U.S. heartland, sneaking into fields to dig up proprietary, genetically modified seeds, which would have cost them nearly a decade and billions in research to develop themselves,"" Wray said. ""And those efforts pale in comparison to their lavishly-resourced hacking program that's bigger than that of every other major country combined."" The Chinese, Wray said, use cyber to ""steal"" volumes of information. He said U.S. officials are working with MI5, the British intelligence service, to identify other investments that the Chinese government makes in proxy relationships -- a kind of third-party venue through which China steals information. Wray said that U.S. companies should be wary of working with or in China, something about which he has warned before, and he urged business leaders to contact the FBI for further information on ways to mitigate the Chinese cyber threat. His warning was the latest episode of the U.S. pushing back on what they describe as Chinese hostility. Relations between the U.S. and China have evolved since President Joe Biden took office -- his predecessor Donald Trump embarked on a trade war with the country -- and the U.S. and China remain deeply intertwined, though they are often opposed on various issues. After one call between Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping earlier this year, the Chinese Foreign Affairs Ministry said, ""The U.S.-China relationship has not yet emerged from the predicament created by the previous U.S. administration but has instead encountered more and more challenges. The U.S. side has made a misreading and misjudgment of China's strategic intentions."" On Wednesday, Wray warned that if China were to invade Taiwan, U.S. companies could see a repeat, on a much larger scale, of the economic disarray from Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the resulting international condemnation. ""Just as in Russia, Western investments built over years could become hostage capital stranded, supply chains and relationships disrupted,"" he said. ""Companies are caught between sanctions and Chinese law forbidding compliance with them. That's not just geopolitics. It's business forecasting."" Wray concluded by saying the U.S. and U.K. were working together to combat this threat. His remarks come as American law enforcement agencies and the Treasury Department cautioned the public of another overseas adversary, this one targeting hospital systems. North Korean-backed cyber actors are targeting the health care and public health sector, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), the FBI and Treasury Department said on Wednesday. These actors use Maui ransomware, a specific technology that has a North Korean hallmark, to infiltrate health care sectors and hold their systems ransom in exchange for a payment, American officials said in an advisory. The officials said that since May 2021, the agencies have observed and reacted to ""multiple"" Maui ransomware incidents indicating that they came from North Korea. ""North Korean state-sponsored cyber actors used Maui ransomware in these incidents to encrypt servers responsible for healthcare services—including electronic health records services, diagnostics services, imaging services, and intranet services,"" the advisory states. ""In some cases, these incidents disrupted the services provided by the targeted HPH Sector organizations for prolonged periods."" The agencies believe that because health care organizations ""provide services that are critical to human life and health,"" they are likely to pay ransoms when attacked. Law enforcement advise not paying the ransom and to contact CISA or the FBI instead. ""Because of this assumption, the FBI, CISA, and Treasury assess North Korean state-sponsored actors are likely to continue targeting HPH Sector organizations,"" the officials said.",20,,,,5

The London-based international human rights group published a new report documenting how the deadly blitz on the Donetsk Academic Regional Drama Theater unfolded, citing interviews with numerous survivors and witnesses as well as ""extensive digital evidence,"" which included photographs, videos, radio intercepts, satellite imagery and radar data. The report concluded that the evidence indicates the attack ""was almost certainly an airstrike carried out by the Russian military,"" with the theater as ""the intended target."" ""After months of rigorous investigation, analysis of satellite imagery and interviews with dozens of witnesses, we concluded that the strike was a clear war crime committed by Russian forces,"" Amnesty International Secretary-General Agnes Callamard said in a statement Thursday. As many as 1,500 civilians had been taking refuge in the grand, columned Donetsk Academic Regional Drama Theater in central Mariupol when it was struck on March 16, according to the Ukrainian government. Russian forces had been relentlessly bombarding the strategic port city in southeastern Ukraine since launching an invasion on Feb. 24. Satellite images taken prior to the attack showed huge, white Cyrillic letters written on the pavement in front of and behind the building, spelling out the Russian word for ""children"" -- ""deti"" -- to alert warplanes to those inside. According to Amnesty International's report, Russian fighter aircraft most likely attacked the theater-turned-shelter using two 500-kilogram bombs that struck close to each other and detonated simultaneously. The strike took place on a clear morning and landed inside the main structure of the theater, which the report noted was a cultural landmark and the only big building in the middle of a large park in Mariupol. The theater's civilian character and the presence of numerous civilians ""were evident,"" according to the report. About a week after the attack, the Mariupol City Council said the death toll was around 300, citing eyewitnesses. A subsequent investigation by The Associated Press found evidence that the strike was far deadlier than initially estimated, killing closer to 600 people inside and outside the building. The AP called it ""the single deadliest known attack against civilians to date"" in Russia's war on Ukraine. It remains unclear exactly how many people were killed, but Amnesty International said the death toll is likely much smaller than previously reported. Based on a review of witness accounts and other sources, the organization believes ""at least a dozen people died in the attack, but also that it is likely that many additional fatalities remain unreported,"" according to the report. ""Many people were injured and killed in this merciless attack. Their deaths were likely caused by Russian forces deliberately targeting Ukrainian civilians,"" Callamard said. ""The International Criminal Court, and all others with jurisdiction over crimes committed during this conflict, must investigate this attack as a war crime. All those responsible must be held accountable for causing such death and destruction."" The Russian military claimed to have fully captured Mariupol in late May, after a nearly three month siege that reduced the city of 430,000 people to smoldering ruin. The victory secured a coastal corridor between Russia and the Crimean Peninsula, which Moscow forcibly annexed from Ukraine in 2014. ""Through the air and on the ground, Russian forces have been on a well-documented and deliberate killing spree of civilians in Ukraine,"" Callamard added. ""Thorough investigations are urgently needed in order to hold perpetrators accountable for the serious injury and loss of civilian life they caused, as well as for the extensive damage to civilian infrastructure.""",45,,,,7
2022-06-27,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/us-purchase-advanced-missile-system-ukraines-defense/story?id=85791000,US to purchase advanced missile system for Ukraine's defense,"The United States is working to finalize the purchase of an advanced air defense system bound for Ukraine, national security adviser Jake Sullivan said at the G-7 summit in Germany Monday. Developed in Norway, the NASAMS is an anti-aircraft medium-to-long-range surface-to-air missile that can reportedly strike targets 100 miles away. Sullivan confirmed to reporters that the U.S. is finalizing the purchase but has yet to sign a contract making the purchase official. It is unclear how much the anti-aircraft system costs. Biden told his global counterparts at the G-7 and Ukraine's President Zelensky about U.S. intentions, Sullivan said. The impending purchase of the NASAMS system is part of a package that will also include artillery ammunition and counter-battery radars, according to Sullivan. The Ukrainian military made specific requests for the ammunition and radars, he said. The NASAMS system is reported to protect restricted airspace around the White House. Monday's announcement from the G-7 summit comes four days after the White House announced it is sending $450 million in aid to Ukraine. HIMARS missile systems are part of that package. Hours after the announcement, initial counts are that 10 died and more than 40 were wounded following a Monday missile strike in Kremenchuk in Ukraine's Poltava region. Residents say the strike hit a shopping mall, setting it ablaze. The administration and President Zelensky hope the NASAMS system and other recent aid from the U.S. will better equip Ukraine to continue its pushback against Russia in the war, which recently entered its fifth month. Some G-7 members also announced Sunday they will further tighten their grip on Russia by banning the imports of Russian gold. The United States, United Kingdom, Canada, and Japan joined together to ban Russia's second-largest import but fellow G-7 members Germany, France, and Italy held out. The move codifies a ban that many refiners, shippers, and banks already voluntarily implemented themselves, and it highlights how even some of the world's global powers -- those geographically closest to the Russia-Ukrainian conflict -- disagree with how to approach the matter. The U.S. Treasury will release an official notice of the ban as it concerns U.S.-based businesses Tuesday. President Zelenskyy met virtually with G-7 leaders Monday as the group moves closer to reaching an agreement that will cap the price of Russian oil, further starving Russia of funds to fuel its war.

2022-06-23,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/US/increased-threat-foreign-terrorists-election-influence-operations-2022/story?id=85598905,"'Increased threat' of foreign terrorists, election influence operations in 2022: DHS","The Department of Homeland Security recently warned that the threat from foreign terrorist organizations and cyberthreat from adversaries like Russia, including election interference, will likely increase in 2022 according to an intelligence analysis obtained by ABC News. The document, titled ""Key Threats to the Homeland in 2022"" and dated June 8, asserts that the greatest threat to the United States this year comes from lone wolf actors and small groups of individuals motived by a cadre of extremist beliefs like the alleged shooter in Buffalo, New York who is currently facing hate crimes charges for killing 10 African-American shoppers at a grocery store. Federal law enforcement agencies including the DHS and Justice Department have previously prioritized combatting domestic violent extremism since the start of the Biden administration. But DHS also warned about the potential for a resurgence of foreign terrorism due to the relaxing pandemic travel restrictions and said they will be ""highly visible"" online -- focused on messaging inspiring homegrown terrorism. ""Foreign terrorists probably will continue to hone their abilities to facilitate international travel, expand their networks, raise funds, and organize, ultimately to improve their ability to target the United States and the Homeland,"" the bulletin says. ""While some travel was very likely curtailed by COVID-19 travel restrictions, we anticipate an increased threat from these actors in 2022 as travel restrictions are relaxed."" Some with terrorist connections may seek to travel to the United States and apply for tourist visas, DHS says. ""What this assessment reinforces is other intelligence indicating that the U.S. continues to experience unacceptable levels of violence by individuals inspired by extremist content promoted online by a diverse array of foreign and domestic threat actors,"" said John Cohen, an ABC News contributor and former acting undersecretary for intelligence and analysis at DHS. ""Law enforcement officials are particularly concerned about the potential for targeted acts of violence directed at law enforcement, election, other elected officials due to increase calls for violence by domestic violent extremists."" Threats to the nation's cyberspace stem from three countries according to DHS: China, Russia and Iran, according to the assessment. Russia will continue to target U.S. critical infrastructure through various cyberattacks and sow discord in the country as it has in previous elections, according to DHS, in some cases leveraging emerging technology like artificial intelligence. ""Russian malign influence actors likely will attempt to dissuade U.S. voters from participating in the 2022 midterm elections using similar tactics employed during the 2020 and 2016 presidential elections, such as targeting audiences with false information about voting logistics, exacerbating racial tensions, and levying attacks or praise on candidates from either political party,"" the memo said. ""Russia probably could use emerging technologies to enhance its cyber and malign influence efforts when attempting to affect the outcome of U.S. elections. For instance, advancements in artificial intelligence allow for automated data analysis, classification, creation, and manipulation of digital content, which could be deployed in future foreign malign influence and disinformation campaigns."" Russia, according to the Department, embeds intelligence officers ""to establish front companies and recruit Russian emigres and American citizens to steal sensitive US academic, government, and business information."" ""It is a threat environment in which a diverse array of foreign and domestic threat actors use internet-based communication platforms to spread content intended to sow discord, inspire violence, undermine confidence in government institutions and achieve other illicit objectives,"" Cohen, the ABC News contributor, said. Chinese state-sponsored actors ""aggressively target U.S. political, economic, military, educational, and critical infrastructure personnel and organizations to steal sensitive data, key technologies, intellectual property, and personally identifiable information."" The department assessed that PRC-sponsored hacking compromised at least 30,000 organizations by exploiting an an email server, DHS says. ""We assess that the PRC will seek to engage in a range of activities to support policies favorable to Beijing and its interests and will likely prioritize messaging against US audiences in the run-up to midterm elections to influence political outcomes favorable to Beijing,"" DHS says. The malign influence campaign from China ""use at least 30 social media platforms and more than 40 websites and niche forums in several languages, including English, Russian, German, Spanish, Korean, and Japanese, to target US audiences."" Additionally, ransomware will continue to increase, according to DHS, because it has been profitable for cybercriminals. ""We assess that ransomware attacks targeting US networks and infrastructure will increase in the near and long term because cybercriminals have developed effective business models to increase their financial gain, likelihood for success, and anonymity,"" the Department says. The bulletin was first reported by the Daily Beast.",20,,,,17

The Army Criminal Investigation Division (CID) and Air Force Office of Special Investigations (OSI) are conducing a joint investigation into the incident. (The probe was first reported by CNN.) Four U.S. service members were evaluated for minor wounds and possible traumatic brain injuries after what the military originally reported to be two indirect-fire rounds hitting the Green Village base in Syria. An Army CID official confirmed in a statement that the service member was being investigated, adding that the person was currently back in the U.S. The official emphasized that ""at this point these are just allegations"" and that any suspects were presumed innocent. ""The investigation is ongoing, which may or may not, develop sufficient evidence to identify a perpetrator(s) and have enough evidence to ensure a conviction in a court of law,"" the official said.",45,,,,6
2022-06-01,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/International/kyiv-authorities-turn-places-hit-russian-missiles-tourist/story?id=85070881,"In Kyiv, authorities turn places hit by Russian missiles into tourist attractions: Reporter's notebook","It starts as a typical historical sightseeing tour. The guide shows us around the Babi Yar memorial. Once a high-end neighborhood of Kyiv, it became a place of one of its biggest tragedies - a mass murder of Jews and gypsies by the Nazis in September 1941. According to various estimates, up to 30,000 people, including children, were shot dead or hung in this place. As the guide continues, we see how the tragic past suddenly evolves into tragic present. The group stops by a TV tower, the tallest building in the city and one of the tallest in the world. Russian missiles hit it on March 1, leaving five people dead and five wounded. The strike disrupted the work of a few Ukrainian TV channels, but the broadcast was resumed two hours after the emergency service repaired the operational center of the tower. ""Russia wanted to make us deaf and blind,"" Liudmyla, a 46-year-old resident of Kyiv, said. ""But the tower withstood. So will Kyiv and Ukraine. We need to be aware of what is going on in the city. That's why I'm happy that the excursion route includes such places."" Kyiv was hit by a barrage of missiles throughout the city from the first days of war. Since then, 150 residents have died, more than 300 have been wounded, according to the local authorities. Western intelligence predicted the fall of the city into Russian hands within 48 hours after the invasion. Instead, the Ukrainian army fought back against the Russian troops, which had to move to other areas in Ukraine in mid-March. ""When we saw that the security situation was improving, we started thinking ahead; how to turn our wounds into advantages,"" Daniil Barashkin, head of the Kyiv tourist information center told ABC News. ""The destruction always terrifies people, that's why it can be very attractive. But at the same time, when we see it, we start appreciating life more."" Now there's a route organized by the Kyiv tourist center that includes the places damaged during the Russian invasion. But the authorities plan to do more, in particular bus tours around the city to show the destroyed residential buildings and a tour around a governmental quarter, which is now heavily guarded. ""I walk in the streets and often see people, including foreigners, looking at some places and discussing how they looked before the war. People are interested in knowing more,"" Barashkin said. The first route organized by the city tourist center attracted almost 50 people. Around 30 attended the second one. ""People come themselves, just after seeing the announcement, and we can't ban them from coming. It's just so cool to see that they are so eager,"" Barashkin said. As we go, the air raid siren goes off. ""We don't hide anymore; let's continue the tour,"" one of the participants said. ""If something happens, we usually pause the tour and proceed to the nearest shelter,"" Barashkin said. ""Before adopting the route at the mayor's office, we made sure it is safe for the people."" The capital's mayor, Vitaliy Klitschko, urges people not to neglect the sirens and reiterates that although now quiet and peaceful, Kyiv is still under threat of missile strikes. ""Unfortunately, we cannot provide 100% security guarantee to those who come to Kyiv,"" he told ABC News. But people should see and remember, how the city suffered and at what price withstood the Russian attack. ""The places we show in this excursion are part of the tragic history of Ukraine, a history of our courageous fight for our cities, our country and our future. They demonstrate that Russia brings war and deaths to our land. People need to see this and never have any illusions about any 'brotherhood with Russia,"" Klitschko said. The last highlight of the excursion is the building of the Artem military concern, which was hit twice by missiles. The building is still partially damaged and uninhabited. ""It's sad and frightening,"" Iryna, a 61-year-old resident of Kyiv, said. ""However, I wouldn't even repair these buildings and leave them as a reminder of what we've come through,"" she said. ""I feel sympathy for the people who suffered due to this war. I want to go around such places and see how I could help my city,"" Ruslan, a 24-year old Kyiv resident, said. ""All these events have been a horror, but the tragedy united all the Ukrainians."" Ironically, the Artem concern, founded in the last years of the Soviet Union, was named after a famous communist Artem, who founded a puppet republic in the east of Ukraine and fought against the Ukrainian nationalists in the early 20th century. ""So it appears that my excursion route tells a bit about the Ukrainian nationalist movement that existed 100 years ago. But this is something that Russia does not recognize and is trying to destroy now, killing thousands of people in Ukraine. And show that, too,"" Vlad Balan, a tourist guide told ABC News. ""But I hope that in the future, I will take the guests around the places that demonstrate development and achievement, not death and destruction. I'm sure it will happen soon.""",47,,,,15
2022-06-01,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/kremlin-warns-biden-sending-rockets-ukraine-adding-fuel/story?id=85106529,Kremlin warns Biden sending rockets to Ukraine 'adding fuel to the fire',"The Kremlin said Wednesday that President Joe Biden's plans to send advanced rocket systems to Ukraine was ""adding fuel to the fire."" ""We know that the United States has been purposefully and meticulously adding fuel to the fire,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said, according to the Russian news agency Interfax. ""The United States pursues the course towards fighting Russia to the last Ukrainian."" Biden said Tuesday the U.S. would provide advanced rocket systems to help Ukraine defend itself, as Russia's invasion nears the 100-day mark. ""We have moved quickly to send Ukraine a significant amount of weaponry and ammunition so it can fight on the battlefield and be in the strongest possible position at the negotiating table,"" Biden wrote in an opinion piece in The New York Times. ""That's why I've decided that we will provide the Ukrainians with more advanced rocket systems and munitions that will enable them to more precisely strike key targets on the battlefield in Ukraine. Russia's foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said Wednesday that if Ukraine receives multiple-launch rocket systems from the West there were ""risks"" of a third country becoming involved in the conflict, according to Interfax. ""Such risks, of course, exist,"" he told reporters, responding to a question, according to Interfax. The White House principal deputy national security adviser, Jonathan Finer, said Wednesday morning that ""Russia has brought this on itself."" ""We don't negotiate our security assistance packages to Ukraine with the Kremlin,"" Finer said during an interview with CNN, adding that Biden had warned Russian President Vladimir Putin ""directly"" that if he ""launched a new, renewed invasion of Ukraine, the United States would increase the amount of security assistance we were providing, including new and advanced systems."" ""They have not been pleased by the amount of security assistance we've been providing to the Ukrainians, frankly, since far before this most recent phase of the conflict began,"" Finer said. The United States will send high mobility artillery rocket systems (HIMARS), which will enable the Ukrainians to ""more precisely strike key targets on the battlefield from a greater distance inside Ukraine, and to help them repel Russians,"" a senior Biden administration official told reporters Tuesday. The missiles will be provided as part of a new $700 million security assistance package for Ukraine -- the 11th of its kind from the U.S. -- which will also include additional Javelin anti-tank missiles, helicopters, tactical vehicles and artillery rounds. The HIMARS is a longer-range rocket system that can fire munitions up to 190 miles. But the munitions the U.S. plans to provide Ukraine have a maximum range of around 43 miles, according to Pentagon officials. Officials say they wanted to limit the range so that the weapons would be used on the battlefield in eastern Ukraine but not fired farther into Russia itself. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Wednesday the weapons systems were ""precisely what they need to defend themselves against the ongoing Russian aggression."" NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg, standing alongside Blinken in Washington, said the United States' support was ""making a difference on the battlefield every day,"" and called the latest round of assistance ""a demonstration of real U.S. leadership."" As Russia has shifted its invasion to the east of the country, Ukrainian fighters have found themselves outgunned by a Russian military with more powerful artillery. Ukraine has struggled to push back Russian advances, and its leaders have long asked the U.S. to send more powerful guns. ""We need more heavy weapons delivered as soon as possible, especially MLRS, to repel Russian attacks,"" Ukraine's foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, tweeted last week, referring to multiple-launch rocket systems. An official stressed Tuesday that the Ukrainians had given the United States ""assurances they will not use"" the new systems the U.S. is providing ""against targets in Russian territory."" ""The Ukrainians have given us assurances that they will not use these systems against targets on Russian territory,"" Blinken said Wednesday. The administration has taken pains to underscore this distinction, given Russia's warning that advanced systems would be seen as an escalation. ""We are mindful of the escalation risks in everything we're doing with this,"" Under Secretary of Defense for Policy Colin Kahl told reporters Wednesday. ""We've been mindful of that, but at the same time, Russia doesn't get a veto over what we send to the Ukrainians."" Biden's announcement came a day after he sparked confusion during a quick exchange with a reporter outside the White House. Asked if he planned ""to send long-range rocket systems to Ukraine,"" Biden only responded, ""We're not going to send to Ukraine rocket systems that can strike into Russia."" White House officials clarified they were still considering sending longer-range systems to Russia. Ultimately, the U.S. stopped short of sharing the longest-range ammunition that could be fired by the HIMARS. As part of the $700 million package, the U.S. will be sending four HIMARS to Ukraine along with precision ammunition. The systems had been pre-placed inside Europe in anticipation of Biden granting Ukraine's request for the systems so as to speed up the transfer, according to Kahl. The Defense Department also created an accelerated three-week training program to teach Ukrainians how to employ and maintain the systems outside of Ukraine. By comparison, U.S. service members normally go through closer to six months of training on HIMARS. ""I will say the Ukrainians have proven time and time again to be extraordinarily ingenious and quick learners. And so I think we've been able to speed things up in the training cycle based on how quickly the Ukrainians have learned systems and been able to integrate them into their activities,"" he said. In his Tuesday New York Times essay, the president stressed the action was not intended to start a broader conflict, and said the U.S. was ""not encouraging or enabling Ukraine to strike beyond its borders"" – nor did it ""want to prolong the war just to inflict pain on Russia."" ""We do not seek a war between NATO and Russia,"" Biden wrote. ""As much as I disagree with Mr. Putin, and find his actions an outrage, the United States will not try to bring about his ouster in Moscow. ""So long as the United States or our allies are not attacked,"" he continued, ""we will not be directly engaged in this conflict, either by sending American troops to fight in Ukraine or by attacking Russian forces.",49,,,,13

The personnel were assigned to help prepare for the presidential visit when they went out for dinner and then stopped at several bars, the sources told ABC News. As the evening progressed, the two Secret Service staffers became apparently intoxicated and the agent wound up in a heated argument with a cab driver, according to the sources. Police were called and a report detailing the ""altercation"" was filed, one source said. ""The Secret Service is aware of an off-duty incident involving two employees which may constitute potential policy violations,"" agency spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said in a statement to ABC News. ""The individuals will be immediately returned back to their post of duty and placed on administrative leave. There was no impact to the upcoming trip. We have very strict protocols and policies for all employees and we hold ourselves to the highest professional standards. Given this is an active administrative personnel matter, we are not in a position to comment further."" The agent who allegedly got into the argument with the cab driver is scheduled to be interviewed by local police before boarding a flight back to the U.S. The decision to send them home was made while the president was still en route to Asia. The latest episode in the Far East carries echoes of the 2012 scandal in which Secret Service employees were investigated for drinking heavily and hiring prostitutes while preparing for a trip by then-President Barack Obama to Cartagena, Colombia. Of the 13 agents first suspected of soliciting prostitutes in Cartagena, three were cleared of wrongdoing and returned to duty, six resigned or retired, and four had their security clearances revoked or were removed, according to a report by the Homeland Security Department inspector general issued in December 2013. According to the report, the agents in Colombia consumed as many as 13 alcoholic drinks ""before engaging in questionable behavior."" ""The Secret Service conducts thousands of advances for protectees each year, including for the president overseas,"" said retired senior Secret Service agent Don Mihalek, an ABC News contributor. ""Through it all, the president has been kept safe and few incidents have arisen. Despite that, the Secret Service is made up of people, some who make mistakes. When they do though, the response has been thorough to ensure that the integrity of the mission is always maintained.""",20,,,,6
2022-05-20,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/us-supplied-howitzers-ukraine-lack-accuracy-aiding-computers/story?id=84840798,US-supplied howitzers to Ukraine lack accuracy-aiding computers,"KYIV -- Dozens of artillery systems supplied by the United States to Ukraine were not fitted with advanced computer systems, which improve the efficiency and accuracy of the weapons, ABC News has learned. The M777 155mm howitzers are now being used by the Ukrainian military in its war with Russia. The Pentagon did not deny that the artillery pieces were supplied without the computers but said it had received ""positive feedback"" from the Ukrainians about the ""precise and highly effective"" weapons. That positive sentiment was echoed by a Ukrainian politician, who spoke to ABC News on condition of anonymity. However, the politician also expressed frustration that the artillery pieces had not been the fitted with the digital computer systems. Artillery is currently playing a crucial role in the fighting raging in eastern Ukraine as Russia continues its offensive in that part of the country. U.S. officials recently confirmed that all but one of the 90 howitzers promised to Ukraine had now been delivered, along with tactical vehicles used to tow them. If fitted to a howitzer, the digital computer system enables the crew operating the weapon to quickly and accurately pinpoint a target. Howitzers without a computer system can still be fired accurately, using traditional methods to calculate the angle needed to hit a target. Modern computer systems, however, rule-out the possibility of human error. Why the artillery pieces supplied to Ukraine did not have the digital targeting technology installed is unclear. The Pentagon said it would not discuss individual components ""for operational security reasons."" ABC News contributor Steve Ganyard, a retired colonel in the United State Marine Corps, said the reason for not providing the computers would be ""compromise."" ""It’s a risk assessment the U.S. does with any export,"" he said. ""If this piece of kit ends up in Moscow, what is the damage to U.S. security? In this case they couldn’t share the best the U.S. has,"" he said. The revelation about the lack of computer systems on the howitzers comes amid broader frustration in Ukrainian political circles that the U.S. has not yet supplied certain types of advanced weaponry. To date, the U.S. and its allies have provided Ukraine with an impressive quantity and array of weapons including thousands of anti-tank missiles, thousands of anti-aircraft missiles, hundreds of armored vehicles and armored personnel carriers and hundreds of attack drones. However, the Ukrainian government is currently lobbying the United States for multiple rocket launcher systems and western-made fighter jets, such as F16s Ukrainian politicians interviewed by ABC News said it was urgent that Ukraine received these types of weapons now, because they believe that Russia is vulnerable following a string of failures on the battlefield. ""Russia is very weak now. Their army is very demoralized,"" said a Ukrainian politician. ""What we are saying is that we need all the multi-rocket-launcher systems now. This is the best time for us to get the Russians out of our country."" ""To do that, we need really good U.S. weapons,"" the politician said.

2022-05-18,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/dhs-pauses-scrutinized-disinformation-group-review-slams-gross/story?id=84808464,DHS pauses much-scrutinized disinformation group for review but slams 'gross mischaracterizations',"The Department of Homeland Security said Wednesday it was pausing its short-lived Disinformation Governance Board pending a review of the larger strategy behind it. The person tapped to lead the group, former Wilson Center fellow Nina Jankowicz, said she had resigned as a result. Both Jankowicz and a DHS spokesperson said the group had itself become a target of disinformation since its creation was announced in late April. A DHS official went further on Wednesday, saying Jankowicz was ""the subject of some particularly vicious and unfair attacks."" As the official suggested, Jankowicz became the face of conservative-fueled criticism, some of it in personal terms. Others voiced concerns about her background: Jankowicz, who is routinely outspoken on Twitter, had publicly criticized Republicans and sowed doubt about the accuracy of press reports critical of President Joe Biden's son Hunter. More broadly, the disinformation board found detractors in the GOP and some leading civil liberties groups over the scope of its work. That scrutiny was fueled by an admittedly clumsy rollout -- such as a confusing name -- as well as an initial lack of specifics about the board's operations. In an interview with ABC News last week, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said the board wasn't rolled out ""effectively,"" but that its work was ""exactly contrary"" to how it was being portrayed. ""It was intended to ensure coordination across the Department's component agencies as they protect Americans from disinformation that threatens the homeland,"" a DHS spokesperson said in a statement on Wednesday. ""The Board has been grossly and intentionally mischaracterized: it was never about censorship or policing speech in any manner. It was designed to ensure we fulfill our mission to protect the homeland, while protecting core Constitutional rights."" ""However,"" the spokesperson continued, ""false attacks have become a significant distraction from the Department's vitally important work to combat disinformation that threatens the safety and security of the American people."" The board is now on hold awaiting a report and a review of strategy for how the department can combat disinformation effectively while still protecting civil liberties. That work will be handled by members of the recently revamped Homeland Security Advisory Council. The DHS said that former Secretary Michael Chertoff and former Deputy Attorney General Jamie Gorelick were tapped by Mayorkas to produce recommendations on the future of the group within 75 days. ""During the HSAC's review … the Department's critical work across several administrations to address disinformation that threatens the security of our country will continue,"" the DHS spokesperson said. In her own statement on Wednesday, Jankowicz said, ""With the Board's work paused and its future uncertain, and I have decided to leave DHS to return to my work in the public sphere. … It is deeply disappointing that mischaracterizations of the Board became a distraction from the Department's vital work, and indeed, along with recent events globally and nationally, embodies why it is necessary."" ""I maintain my commitment to building awareness of disinformation's threats and trust the Department will do the same,"" Jankowciz said. Administration officials emphasized that the decision to temporarily suspend the board was in part due to the ""extreme"" reaction from those who disagreed with it. ""There have been gross mischaracterizations of what the board what the board's work would be and there have been grotesque personal attacks,"" one official said Wednesday. ""And the reaction has candidly become a distraction to the department's important work in addressing disinformation to security."" Mayorkas himself ultimately made the move to reassess the board before the group ever hosted its first meeting, according to the official. Asked if the decision was politically motivated, the official said the broader point was to ensure the success of the department's mission to counter misinformation campaigns, which the government believes compromise security. The DHS had been on the defensive about the board for weeks, with Mayorkas being pressed by Republicans about it during a Senate hearing earlier this month. The department previously admitted that ""there has been confusion about the working group, its role, and its activities"" and vowed to work on building greater public trust. DHS has said the the panel would not be involved in managing department operations and Mayorkas said the group would ""bring together the experts throughout our department to ensure that our ongoing work in combating disinformation is done in a way that does not infringe on free speech, a fundamental constitutional right embedded in the First Amendment, nor on the right of privacy or other civil rights and civil liberties."" Addressing disinformation is a major homeland security priority and DHS had said the new board would help counter false claims from human smugglers and Russia. A Homeland Security spokesperson stressed that work again on Wednesday, noting ""malicious efforts spread by foreign adversaries, human traffickers, and transnational criminal organizations."" Some Republicans cheered the board's suspension, renewing attacks that it was ""Orwellian"" in nature and would, despite DHS' statements otherwise, be ""policing"" U.S. citizens. ""This board was only successful in reinforcing that the Department of Homeland Security's priorities are severely misplaced,"" Rep. Mike Turner, of Ohio, and New York Rep. John Katko said in a joint statement Wednesday. ""When the border crisis is worsening daily, cyber-attacks from adversaries are threatening to cripple our critical infrastructure, the rise in violent crime is putting Americans across the country in danger, and disrupted supply chains are having devastating impacts on Americans, DHS is focused on policing Americans' free speech."" But the group was warily received by some civil liberties advocates, too. ""The burden is on the government to explain why a Homeland Security Department needs a disinformation board in the first place,"" Ben Wizner, director of ACLU's Speech, Privacy, and Technology Project, told ABC News on Wednesday. ""They really have only themselves to blame for the political backlash, given that they announced this without offering any clarity about the mission or scope of the board."" A group of First Amendment-focused organizations wrote to Mayorkas earlier this month asking for the type of re-evaluation that DHS has now announced. ""The Department has demonstrated a readiness to cross the legal bounds of privacy and speech rights. Coupled with the Department's checkered record on civil liberties, the Department's muddled announcement of the Board has squandered the trust that would be required for the Board to fulfill its mission,"" the groups, led by the nonprofit Protect Democracy, said in a statement. Former Acting Head of Intelligence and Analysis at DHS John Cohen, who is also an ABC News contributor, said the responsibilities of the board were widely misunderstood. ""The intention of the board was to facilitate the discussion on policy issues impacting the department, it was meant to ensure that the department protected privacy and civil liberties, as they move to evaluate threat related online content,"" Cohen said. Cohen, who helped stand up the disinformation board and left the department last month, said earlier in May that the board addressed a communication issue within the department. ""It didn't coordinate operational activities, it wasn't governing intelligence operations, it had no input on how organizations collect intelligence or information,"" he said then. ""It was simply intended to be a working group that would gather on an ad hoc basis to address matters of policy.""",20,,,,25

Russia began its attacks on the city in early March. The Ukrainians and Russians struck a deal to exchange badly injured soldiers from the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol for Russian prisoners of war, Ukraine's Deputy Defense Minister Anna Malyar told a Ukrainian TV station. Mariupol's mayor confirmed that a cease-fire remains in place in the port city. The Ukrainian military ordered remaining troops who had been sheltering beneath the Azovstal steel factory to focus on efforts to save the lives of their personnel. More than 260 Ukrainian soldiers were evacuated through a humanitarian corridor, some of whom were injured, according to Ukraine's defense minister. Malyar said that 53 wounded soldiers are being transported from Azovstal to Novoazovsk where they will receive immediate medical attention. ""About Azovstal, we hope that we'll manage to save their lives. There are seriously injured among them. I want to stress that we need our defenders alive. The operation to rescue them was launched by our military. We work on getting them home and this work demands delicacy and time,"" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in his daily address. Another 211 Ukrainian fighters were accompanied by Russian forces from Azovstal to Olenivka in rebel-held Donetsk, where they will be part of the exchange for Russian prisoners of war. ""As a part of an exchange deal, 50 wounded were evacuated from Azovstal to Novoazovsk. Negotiations are underway for them to be transferred to Zaporozhzhya,"" another source told ABC News, confirming the exchange. Russia's state-run TASS reported that Russia's defense ministry confirmed an agreement was reached on Monday to evacuate wounded Ukrainian troops from the plant and transport them to a medical facility in Novoazovsk to ""provide them with all the necessary assistance."" The Russian defense ministry on Tuesday said 265 Ukrainian militants have laid down arms and surrendered, including 51 who are seriously wounded. All those in need of medical assistance were sent for treatment to a hospital in Novoazovsk, Donetsk People's Republic.

2022-05-14,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/International/21-year-russian-soldier-stand-trial-kyiv-murdering/story?id=84694989,21-year-old Russian soldier to stand trial in Kyiv for murdering Ukrainian civilian,"The first case against a member of the Russian military is set to go to trial on May 18. 21-year-old Russian serviceman Vadim Shishimarin is accused of killing an unarmed Ukrainian civilian in the Sumy region on Feb. 28, according to Iryna Venediktova, Ukraine's prosecutor general. The civilian was a resident of Chupakhivka who was riding a bike on the roadside when he was shot, Venediktova alleged. Shishmarin is charged with murder and two counts of robbery. He surrendered to Ukrainian law enforcement on the same day and has been a prisoner of war since, Ukrainian prosecutor Andriy Syniuk said. Shishmarin's lawyer and a public defender, Viktor Ovsiannikov, refused to disclose his strategy, but said the fact the soldier was following orders does not legally constitute a defense. It’s up to the judges whether to take that under consideration. The length of the trial will depend on how the defendant will plead, but the prosecution has sufficient proof regardless, Syniuk told ABC News. Syniuk also said Shishmarin has cooperated throughout the investigation. Shishimarin is the first member of the Russian military to be facing a criminal trial, Venediktova said in a post on Facebook. Prosecutor Andriy Syniuk told ABC News that trying this case should set the standard and prove that Ukraine is a country with a rule of law and respect for human rights. He said this case is important and that more hearings will be starting soon. Three other people are involved in these crimes, but Shishmarin is the only one facing charges for now, according to the prosecutor. ABC News' Tatiana Rymarenko contributed to this report.",45,,,,3
2022-05-13,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/homeland-security-announces-16b-local-grants-extremism-security/story?id=84670065,"Homeland Security announces $1.6B in local grants for election security, to combat extremism","Shortly after the Boston Marathon bombing in 2013, then-top Department of Homeland Security official Alejandro Mayorkas saw a picture of a Federal Emergency Management Agency analysis as part of the investigation — and realized the equipment used, to illustrate what happened on the day of bombing and lay out a plethora of evidence and leads, had been purchased through a grant program run by his department. Years later, a repeat: After a shooting on the New York City subway last month injured 10 people, Mayorkas told ABC News in an interview this week, authorities relied on equipment purchased with FEMA funds to capture ""critical evidence."" ""We impact people's lives by making those lives safer,"" said Mayorkas, now the secretary of DHS. The DHS on Friday announced nearly $1.6 billion as part of the FEMA preparedness grant program for the 2022 fiscal year, available to cities from coast to coast, with a specific focus on terrorism and preventing disasters. The newly announced awards are the latest in what DHS officials called significant funding funneled to the local level. Since FEMA's preparedness grant program began in 2002, the department has given localities more than $54 billion. State and local governments, which can apply annually, can be funded by eight grant programs that range from an increase in law enforcement equipment to overtime for local officers on the southern border. The grant recipients for the largest amount of money, the Urban Area Security Initiative, have to address six priority areas of cybersecurity, soft target and crowded places, information and intelligence sharing, domestic violent extremism, community preparedness and resilience and election security, according to DHS. The categories of community preparedness and resilience and election security are new for 2022, Mayorkas told ABC News. DHS' continued focus on cybersecurity and domestic extremism comes amid the department's concerns of possible Russian cyberattacks as retaliation to the U.S. response to the war in Ukraine and what Mayorkas himself has called one of the ""greatest"" threats to the country: homegrown extremists. As part of the latest wave of grants, which will be disbursed throughout the 2022 fiscal year, DHS will identify 36 high-threat, high-density cities, states and localities that will receive some of the $615 million funds allocated through the program to focus on the six priority areas. These areas are selected in a nonpartisan way, Mayorkas stressed. ""This is a risk-based program,"" he said. The secretary told ABC News that officials have increased the percentage of funds — from 25% to 30% — which must be dedicated to law enforcement's terrorism prevention. Mayorkas cited their ""role in preventing terrorist acts on the front lines in each of our communities across the country."" In years past, according to public filings, the grants have been used to fund local narcotics task forces, training for intelligence analysts and more. Mayorkas says the program has improved because they've engaged with local stakeholders on the flexibility of how they spend their grant money. Along the southern border — where federal officials have been dealing with historically high levels of migration — the department is allocating $90 million for local communities through their Operation Stonegarden grant. Operation Stonegarden pays for border officer overtime, Mayorkas said, as well as technology enhancements for local communities, such as phones and tablets to allow for better communication, according to previous filings. Regarding the southern border, the secretary told ABC News that the federal government has been planning since September for the end of Title 42, the Trump-era policy continued by the Biden administration which expels migrants before they can seek asylum under the auspices of a public heath emergency. President Joe Biden's White House is seeking to now roll back the use of Title 42 regarding immigrants — which drew intense criticism from advocates under both Trump and Biden — but that plan is being challenged in court, with the latest hearing scheduled in Louisiana on Friday. Conservatives have continually voiced concerns about how the government will handle high levels of immigration at the same time that the government's treatment of these migrants, dating beyond the Biden administration, has also drawn scrutiny.",20,,,,12
2022-05-09,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/secret-service-jill-biden-ukraine-analysis/story?id=84598285,How the Secret Service got Jill Biden to Ukraine: ANALYSIS,"First lady Jill Biden made news when she conducted an unannounced visit to western Ukraine on Sunday. The first lady traveled by vehicle to the town of Uzhhorod, which was about a 10-minute drive from the Slovakian border, and spent about two hours in Ukraine. Considering that the entire nation is gripped in a war with Russia, and the United States had pulled out its diplomatic staff, closed its Embassy and has no real resources in the country, this type of a visit is difficult and dangerous. Since it began protecting presidents, the United States Secret Service has escorted the president and other high-ranking government officials into war zones, disaster areas and places in extreme distress. Whether during World War II with President Franklin Delano Roosevelt visiting troops on the front lines of battle, bringing President Lyndon B. Johnson to Vietnam during the war, or both President George W. Bush and Barack Obama’s trips to Iraq and Afghanistan, despite the overwhelming security risks, the Secret Service has always managed to make these trips happen and keep the protectees safe. This all starts with planning and the Secret Service advance process. Any trip a Secret Service protectee embarks on, domestic or overseas, begins with the advance. In the case of the first lady, this likely included close coordination between the Secret Service and White House staff to determine the destination, scope and duration of any visit. Once those decisions are made, the security planning begins and often includes counterparts from different federal and state agencies. In the case of a foreign advance, where neither the Secret Service nor the U.S. government has any real authority, a liaison is established with the host country's security forces via the Secret Service offices located in that geographic area, and the U.S. State Department and its Diplomatic Security Services (DSS) Regional Security Offices. Depending on the nature of the visit, the host country is typically notified via diplomatic notice of the impending visit of a United States dignitary. In cases where the nature of the visit has real security concerns, such as in a war zone, that notification is typically made at the highest levels, specifically the ambassador. The visit information is typically closely held so that the dissemination of any information that may be advantageous to an adversary is minimized. This includes the use of secure communication methods between the White House, State Department and Secret Service. One of the overriding security and logistics concerns for these types of visits is the ability to tap into or transport in U.S. military and Secret Service assets to support the visit. In places where the U.S. military has a presence or can operate, the support and logistics are made easier. In the case of a location where neither of those resources is available -- as is the case in Ukraine, the Secret Service must work with the local security forces and make decisions about what level of support they can provide and what, if any, Secret Service support they will permit. Often these visits use elements of clandestine operations in order to preserve the protective methodology the Secret Service uses to transport the protectee to the location and specific locations of the visit. These clandestine methods include ""covers for action"" and diversions for, in this case, the first lady’s schedule and movements, as well as for the Agents and military assets assigned to support the visit. These assets may include vehicles, extra personnel, communications gear and robust tactical units such as the Secret Service Counter Assault Team (CAT), DSS Mobile Security Deployment (MSD) and U.S. Military Special Operations. All of this is to ensure that both the Secret Service and host nation can secure a safe visit for the protectee and that any adversaries' ability to compromise the methods used for creating that visit remain classified.

2022-05-08,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/International/russia-suffered-loss-extraordinary-number-generals/story?id=84545931,Why Russia has suffered the loss of an 'extraordinary' number of generals,"During its war in Ukraine, Russia's top military leadership has proven to be particularly vulnerable, experts say. Ukraine's Ministry of Defense has claimed that 12 Russian generals have been killed since the invasion began in late February. Russian officials have not confirmed that number. U.S. officials -- who last week pushed back on a New York Times report that said the U.S. provided Ukraine intelligence that helped it target and kill Russian generals and other senior officers -- also have not confirmed the number of Russian generals killed. Though, as reported by Ukraine, that kind of loss is ""quite extraordinary,"" ABC News contributor and retired Col. Steve Ganyard said. ""Maybe you'd have to go back to World War II to have that sort of proportion of senior officers being killed on the front lines,"" Ganyard said. Such a high number of casualties at that level suggests several things -- one being a lack of confidence among Russian military leaders in their troops, according to Ganyard. ""It suggests that the generals need to be at the front lines to ensure that their troops are conducting the battle plan in the way that they want,"" he said. ""But that also suggests a lack of confidence in their troops if they need to be that far forward with that many senior folks."" That demonstrates Russia's seriousness about its campaign but is also ""an indication of how weak the Russian military has turned out to be in that they need that much senior leadership that far forward,"" Ganyard said. Russian generals also may be especially vulnerable due to the structure of Russia's military, experts say. Unlike the U.S. military, Russia does not empower its non-commissioned and junior officers with the authority to make decisions on their own, said Mick Mulroy, a former deputy assistant secretary of defense for the Middle East and an ABC News contributor. ""They do not delegate authority. So, they are out giving orders directly to their forces,"" Mulroy said. ""The lack of delegation is another reason the Russian military is performing so poorly."" Poor morale among Russian troops may also be giving Ukraine an advantage in the war, despite Ukrainians being outnumbered by enemy troops and military equipment, Ganyard said. ""As soon as communication breaks down … the young folks in the Russian military don't know what to do and they know that they're just being told to do something, particularly when it's a fight where their heart isn't in it,"" he said. ""That is an advantage that Ukraine has proven to be decisive on the battlefield thus far."" Russian troops have also been shown to be vulnerable to electronic eavesdropping while on the ground in Ukraine, Ganyard said. ""One of the many failures of the Russian military in this war is that it has shown how little they have invested in command and control capabilities,"" he said. ""The Russians aren't even using encryption, so it means that anybody -- if they find the frequency -- are able to listen in."" There are ""very credible reports"" of Russian troops even confiscating phones from Ukrainian citizens and using those for command and control operations, Ganyard said. ""So obviously, the Ukrainians can tap into their own phone lines if they can figure out who's doing it,"" he said. Russian soldiers have also been tracked in real-time through geolocation of social media posts, Ganyard said. ""The modern age has introduced lots of benefits, but in the case of the military, it actually becomes dangerous because most of the apps that people are running are not encrypted and they're passing real-time data of where people are,"" he said. Tracking Russian troops could lead Ukrainian forces to command posts -- and likely top military leadership. ""If you shell and you take out a command post, you're probably going to take out quite a bit of senior leadership,"" Ganyard said. Amid the claims of Russia's military leadership losses, it is unclear what the Ukrainian military has similarly suffered. ""The Ukrainians have been very good at controlling the narrative on social media and on media in general,"" Ganyard said. ""We're getting anecdotal reporting back-channel that the Ukrainians are paying a price, too."" And with a smaller military, the Ukrainians ""can pay a price less than the Russians can,"" he added. ""The Ukrainians are hurting,"" Ganyard said. ""This is not something where the Ukrainians are not taking any losses, while the Russians are.""

2022-05-05,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/officials-push-back-report-us-intel-helping-ukraine/story?id=84518393,Officials push back on report US intel helping Ukraine target Russian generals,"U.S. officials on Thursday pushed back on a New York Times report that said the U.S. provided Ukraine intelligence that helped it target and kill Russian generals and other senior officers. National Security Council spokesperson Adrienne Watson took exception to the story's headline: ""U.S. Intelligence Is Helping Ukraine Kill Russian Generals, Officials Say."" ""The headline of this story is misleading and the way it is framed is irresponsible. The United States provides battlefield intelligence to help the Ukrainians defend their country. We do not provide intelligence with the intent to kill Russian generals,"" Watson said, drawing a semantic distinction, appearing to want to distance the U.S. from any direct involvement in an attack on Russian commanders. A second U.S. official with knowledge of U.S. intelligence-sharing with Ukraine confirmed that the U.S. provides intelligence on movements of Russian units and command posts, but not on individual Russian military leaders. ""The U.S. is not providing intelligence on Russian generals,"" the official told ABC News Wednesday evening. A third official told ABC News the same: ""That is not how we operate."" Pentagon press secretary John Kirby offered clarifying remarks during a press briefing Thursday. ""The United States provides battlefield intelligence to help Ukrainians defend their country,"" Kirby said. ""We do not provide intelligence on the location of senior military leaders on the battlefield or participate in the targeting decisions of the Ukrainian military."" The New York Times story originally cited American officials claiming U.S. intelligence ""has helped Ukrainians target and kill many of the Russian generals who have died in action in the Ukraine war."" Officials say it is correct, as reported by the Times, that the Ukrainians are able to combine what they learn from the U.S. with their own intelligence to then target Russian leaders. But they emphasized that the U.S. does not play a direct role in targeting individuals on the battlefield. Other nations are also sharing intelligence with Ukraine, which has its own ""robust"" capabilities, according to Kirby. ""Ukraine combines information that we and other partners provide with the intelligence that they themselves are gathering on the battlefield, and then they make their own decisions, and they take their own actions,"" Kirby said. The Kremlin also responded to the article, saying its troops are aware of intelligence-assistance for Ukraine coming from the West. ""Our servicemen are well aware that the United States, the United Kingdom and NATO in general are providing intelligence and information about other parameters to the Ukrainian Armed Forces on a permanent basis. This is well known and, of course, together with the arms supply to Ukraine by the same countries and the alliance, all of those actions are not helping rapidly finalize the operation, although they cannot hinder the achievement of objectives set for the special military operation,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said at a press briefing Thursday. Ukraine's Ministry of Defense has claimed 12 Russian generals have been killed since the invasion, though U.S. officials have not confirmed this when asked. One reason senior officers might be particularly vulnerable is due to the structure of Russia's military. ""They do not delegate authority,"" said Mick Mulroy, former deputy assistant secretary of defense for the Middle East and ABC News contributor. ""So, they are out giving orders directly to their forces."" Unlike the U.S. military, Russia does not empower its non-commissioned and junior officers with the authority to make decisions on their own, according to Mulroy. ""It's the only way to effectively fight in modern combined arms maneuver warfare,"" he said. ""The lack of delegation is another reason the Russian military is performing so poorly."" Top American military leaders have publicly stated the U.S. is sharing intelligence to help Ukrainians in their fight against Russia's invading forces. ""We have opened up the pipes,"" Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told senators Tuesday. ""There is a significant amount of intelligence flowing to the Ukraine from the United States."" The officials ABC News spoke to could not say whether the U.S. has any hard rules in place against giving Ukraine intelligence on high-level leaders, including top Russian general Valery Gerasimov, who spent multiple days in the contested Donbas region last week. But according to Mulroy, there is nothing wrong in principle with helping Ukraine kill Russian generals. ""Targeting generals is fully lawful, targeting non-combatant civilians is not,"" Mulroy said. ""If Russian generals don't want to be targeted, they should withdraw their forces and return to Russia."" ABC News' Molly Nagle contributed to this report.",20,,,,20
2022-05-04,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/US/dr-ozs-vote-2018-turkish-election-renews-criticism/story?id=84326742,Dr. Oz's vote in 2018 Turkish election renews criticism,"As Dr. Mehmet Oz embarks on a bid for the U.S. Senate, the television star has largely shied away from discussing his ties to Turkey, where he maintains citizenship, and dismissed criticism from political opponents that he harbors any so-called ""dual loyalties."" But a photograph of Oz casting a ballot in Turkey's 2018 presidential election is rankling some national security experts -- particularly after recently saying he has ""never been politically involved in Turkey in any capacity."" ""The decision to vote in a foreign country's election is problematic from a security clearance perspective,"" according to John V. Berry, a former government lawyer with expertise in federal security clearances. After a rocky start to his campaign, Oz recently earned a coveted endorsement from former President Donald Trump, bolstering his chances of capturing the Republican nod. But political opponents have continued to target his connections to Turkey -- a strategy the Oz campaign and others have called xenophobic smears. If elected, Oz has said he would renounce his Turkish citizenship. When asked about the photograph, which appeared in June 2018 on the Facebook page of Turkey's consulate in Manhattan, Brittany Yanick, an Oz campaign spokesperson, confirmed its authenticity to ABC News and confirmed that Oz did vote in the 2018 election. According to Yanick, Oz voted for opposition candidate Muharrem Ince in his unsuccessful campaign against Turkish President Recep Tayyep Erdogan. She denied that Oz's vote amounted to ""political involvement."" ""Voting in an election is far different from being actively engaged in the political work of the Turkish government, which Dr. Oz has never been involved with,"" Yanick told ABC News. ""There is no security issue whatsoever."" Elected officials are not subjected to the same level of scrutiny as civilians who seek security clearances for sensitive government work; once sworn-in, lawmakers are granted access to classified information, unless the executive branch denies them certain information. But the background check process for civilians can also ""provide a framework for analyzing whether someone is trustworthy or not,"" according to Kel McClanahan, the executive director of National Security Counselors, a nonprofit public interest law firm. And for McClanahan, voting in another country's election would set off a ""giant, flashing red light."" Born and raised in Ohio, Oz has said that he maintains dual U.S.-Turkey citizenship to care for his mother in Turkey, who suffers from Alzheimer's disease. He also served in the Turkish army for 60 days in the early 1980s -- reportedly to retain his Turkish citizenship -- and maintains real estate holdings in Turkey, plus has an endorsement deal the country's national airline, Turkish Airlines. ""Any single one of those would be enough to torpedo a [security] clearance,"" McClanahan said. ""Taken together, I would not put good odds on that person getting a clearance anywhere."" Turkish voting records indicate that the 2018 presidential election was the first in which Oz participated. Prior to the 2014 election, Turks living abroad could only vote by returning home or by visiting polling stations set up on Turkey's borders. Yanick, the campaign spokesperson, said Oz did not plan to vote in the 2018 election, but decided to cast a ballot while at the consulate discussing his ""humanitarian work on behalf of Syrian refugees in Turkey."" ""It was during an election season, so he voted,"" Yanick said. Other security experts ABC News spoke with expressed less concern with Oz's 2018 vote. Steve Aftergood, a senior analyst at the Federation of American Scientists, said that because Oz has been transparent about his ties to Turkey, his dual citizenship alone is more of a political concern for him than a risk to national security. ""The fact that [Oz] has made no effort to conceal his dual citizenship counts in his favor,"" Aftergood said. ""Voters will have an opportunity to decide whether or not it is of concern to them."" Security experts that ABC News consulted emphasized that the country in question matters when considering potential foreign influence risks. A person's ties to Turkey, a NATO member and strategic ally to the U.S., present far less of a threat than China or Russia. But in recent years, Turkish President Erdogan has demonstrated increasingly authoritarian behavior, jailing journalists and summarily silencing opposition voices. Erdogan has also strained ties with the U.S. by purchasing Russian weapons systems. Richard Grenell, the former Director of National Intelligence under President Trump, characterized Oz's understanding of Turkey an asset in the fight against authoritarianism. ""It is frankly un-American to suggest that first- and second-generation Americans are unworthy or suspect to work as a U.S. official,"" Grenell said. ""They've seen fascism and totalitarianism and are actually more clear-eyed about what is at stake."" Background check investigators consider ""the totality of circumstances"" when investigating those seeking security clearances, said Sean Bigley, a national security lawyer and former Trump-appointee to the National Security Education Board. Bigley said Oz's portfolio of risk would likely include his existing financial ties to Turkey. According to financial disclosures submitted in April, Oz owns several hundreds of thousands of dollars in real estate property in Turkey, including a building he has leased out to the Turkish Ministry of Education for free. The building is being used as a student dormitory, according to his disclosure form, and ""is subject to pending trust and estate litigation."" The disclosure form also shows Oz scored a lucrative endorsement contract with Turkish Airlines, Turkey's national flag-carrying airline. Experts say the air carrier has grown increasingly close to Erdogan since 2018, when he named himself chairman of the country's sovereign wealth fund, which holds a 49% stake. In 2018, Oz appeared in a Super Bowl advertisement for Turkish Airlines, and in 2021, he appeared in a four-minute informational discussing the airline's COVID-19 safety protocols as a brand ambassador. Any wealth Oz has accumulated from his interests in Turkey, including the airline deal, would reflect only a small amount of his full financial picture. In all, Oz's disclosure shows that he and his spouse together own between $104 and $422 million in various assets and holdings. Even so, Bigley said, ""if I were advising [Oz], I would suggest divesting from any assets or ... financial ties with any entity of the Turkish government."" Oz has faced criticism for not using his celebrity prominence as a platform for denouncing Erdogan's clampdowns on opposition and other democratic backsliding. Some suggest that Oz's continuing financial interests in Turkey create a disincentive for him to criticize its leadership, as doing so could put Oz at risk of having his Turkish assets seized. ""It is the nature of the Turkish system and authoritarian systems more generally that folks who do not want to be targeted by the state kowtow to leaders or keep their mouth shut,"" said Steven Cook, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. ""There are many examples of people who have dared to criticize Erdogan who have been forcibly divested."" Nicholas Danforth, a non-resident fellow at the Hellenic Foundation for European and Foreign Policy, an Athens-based think tank, agreed. ""If you wanted to have a lucrative career as a spokesman for Turkish Airlines, you certainly couldn't say anything negative about Erdogan,"" Danforth said. According to several news reports published since launching his campaign, Oz has met with Erdogan on at least two occasions, in 2014 and 2018, and attended events with officials in Erdogan's party. Oz has said that attending these functions was normal for a Turkish-American of his stature. Asked whether Oz had taken a public stance against Erdogan, Yanick provided ABC News with comments Oz made at a January 2022 campaign event in which he said he ""would be the harshest critic of Erdogan"" in the Senate. ""The country that I respected when I was growing up -- Turkey, the country my father left -- was a secular country where there was no significant Islamic rule elements, period,"" he said. ""And it was not a dictatorship."" Hailed in the West as a charismatic leader with the potential to return Turkey to its secular roots, Muharrem Ince fell to Erdogan in the 2018 election by a substantial margin -- 52 percent to 30. Ince attracted support from a broad coalition of anti-Erdogan parties, but also expressed some controversial opinions -- including an interest in rebuilding ties with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. ""Ince was hardly a paragon of democracy, human rights, and tolerance,"" said Cook. As one of Turkey's most recognizable figures in the West, Oz is not the first high-profile candidate to face accusations of a so-called ""dual loyalty,"" a claim reminiscent of attacks against Catholics, Jews and members of other religious and ethnic groups in previous generations. During the 2016 presidential campaign, then-candidate Donald Trump accused Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, of maintaining dual loyalties to Canada, his country of birth, even though Cruz had renounced his Canadian citizenship in 2014. Trump has not expressed any similar concern for Oz's arrangement.",20,,,,29
2022-04-22,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/battle-donbas-weapons-us-rushing-ukraine-critical/story?id=84173580,The battle for Donbas: Why the weapons the US is rushing to Ukraine are so critical,"As Russia's military gears up for what it hopes will be a decisive victory over Ukraine in the eastern part of the country, the U.S. is rushing to send weapons and equipment needed to hold off the larger invading force in the rural and open Donbas terrain -- a far different battlefield from the urban fighting where Ukrainian forces held an advantage. What could make all the difference now is the new $800 million military aid package for Ukraine President Joe Biden announced Thursday. It's a race against time -- maybe a matter of weeks, a U.S. defense official said. ""Now they've launched and refocused their campaign to seize new territory in eastern Ukraine, and we're in a critical window now of time where they're going to set the stage for the next phase of this war,"" Biden said of the Russian offensive, which U.S. military officials believe is just getting started. ""We know that time is not our friend,"" Pentagon press secretary John Kirby told reporters Tuesday. Russia gains by being closer to its border With Ukrainian forces focused in the east, Russia intends to push down from the north, near the city of Izium, and up from the south, surrounding the Ukrainian defenders to ""finish them or force them to surrender,"" a senior U.S. official said Thursday. If Russia takes the beleaguered city of Mariupol in the south, it could free up thousands of troops to join the push north to trap Ukraine forces, according to the official. Although Russia and Ukraine have been battling over Donbas for eight years, Russia's concentrated flow of troops and weapons into the region could bring ""a whole different level of fighting,"" Kirby said Tuesday. There are now 85 battalion tactical groups (BTGs), Russia's main fighting units, inside Ukraine, according to the official. Each BTG is made up of roughly 800-1,000 troops. About 10 of them crossed into the country this week, most heading to the Donbas region. Kirby said the U.S. is focused on sending Ukraine weapons and systems that are not only useful for the rural eastern terrain, but that the Ukrainians can use in the fight without much training. Russia, meanwhile, is trying not to repeat blunders it committed in northern Ukraine, and will enjoy certain geographic advantages in Donbas. Early on, Russian invaders in the north were beset by supply problems, running out of food for troops and fuel for vehicles, failing to achieve any major victories. Pentagon officials believe they did not expect such strong resistance from Ukrainians so didn't adequately prepare for a prolonged fight. But since withdrawing its troops in the north to focus on Donbas, Russia has been putting equipment and support forces in place ahead of its combat troops to favorably condition the battlefield. ""We believe that they are trying to learn from past mistakes, and you can see that in just the way they are conducting these shaping operations,"" Kirby told reporters Monday. ""They're conducting themselves in ways that we didn't see around Kyiv, for instance."" Another advantage for Russia is that its logistics will be simplified by fighting closer to its own border, while Ukraine will now face the challenge of transporting heavy weapons and ammunition coming over its western border all the way across the country, meaning more miles for something to go wrong, and more chances for Russia to strike these vital shipments. How US-provided artillery and radars could make a difference To stand a chance fighting in the open Donbas landscape, Ukraine will need more long-range weapons and the ability to quickly move troops on the ground and in the air, according to Mick Mulroy, former deputy assistant secretary of defense for the Middle East and ABC News contributor. The U.S. has sent Ukraine $3.4 billion of aid since the beginning of the invasion, including many thousands of shoulder-fired missiles, small arms and ammunition, body armor, and medical supplies. The two most recent packages, dedicating $800 million of aid each, announced April 13 and 21, were tailored to reflect the new battle space. ""It's different,"" Biden said Thursday. ""It’s flat, it's not in the mountains, and it requires different kinds of weapons to be more effective."" To that end, the U.S. is sending 90 of its 155mm howitzers, which officials say will begin arriving over the weekend. ""This is going to be the king of battle out there,"" Mulroy said. While Ukraine already has Russian-made artillery pieces, the U.S. and most Western nations do not have the corresponding 152mm ammunition to offer as it runs through its limited stockpiles. The incoming U.S.-made 155mm guns will bring Ukrainian forces extra firepower, but also the ability to be better resupplied by the West. To start, the U.S. is sending 184,000 artillery rounds along with the 90 weapons. Russia has been flowing its own artillery into Donbas in preparation for its renewed offensive. To help Ukraine counter the threat, the U.S. is sending 14 radar systems that can detect incoming artillery and other indirect-fire attacks and find where they're coming from. ""Right now the Russians are kind of just lobbing artillery without any consequence,"" Mulroy said. ""They want to give them a whole lot of consequence."" The radar systems can help the Ukrainians accurately fire back. ""The counter radar is moving to theater this week,"" a senior U.S. defense official said Thursday, adding that the howitzers and radar systems complement each other, but can also be used independently. Training will be critical About 50 Ukrainians are being trained on the U.S. howitzers outside of the country. This first group of trainees is expected to finish around the same time as the first artillery pieces arrive in their country, likely Sunday or Monday, according to a U.S. official. The U.S. is using a ""train-the-trainer"" approach so as not to pull too many high-demand troops away from the front -- the small group of Ukrainians learning to use the new systems will return to their country to train fellow Ukrainian troops there. The U.S. took a similar approach with the small, explosive Switchblade drones, hundreds of which are headed to Ukraine. A small number of Ukrainians were in the U.S. for pre-scheduled military education when Russia invaded their country. The U.S. capitalized on their presence to add a couple days of training on the Switchblades, which are designed to fly directly into targets and explode. ""Although it's not a very difficult system to operate, we took advantage of having them in the country to give them some rudimentary training on that,"" a U.S. defense official said on April 6. U.S. officials have said other systems being sent to Ukraine will also require a small period of training, likely to also take place outside of the country. Officials have declined to specify where such training could take place, citing operational security concerns. With Russia intent on surrounding and trapping Ukrainian forces, the ability to move troops quickly by ground and air will be essential, according to Mulroy. ""They're going to try to envelope the Ukrainians and cut them off and starve them,"" he said. ""So, the Ukrainians need to have the ability not to let that happen."" Since the beginning of the invasion, the U.S. has given Ukraine 16 Mi-17 transport helicopters, each able to carry a three-person crew and up to 30 passengers. Mulroy said an advantage of the Soviet-designed Mi-17 is that Ukrainian pilots already know how to fly them. The U.S. has also offered Ukraine hundreds of armored personnel carriers that have tracks similar to those of tanks, as well as armored Humvees. Weather will likely play a factor, and muddy conditions during Spring could limit vehicle mobility for both sides. ""Even just this week, the ground as it is makes it harder for them to operate off of paved roads and highways,"" Kirby said. Time is of the essence Mulroy said the U.S. is doing a great job shipping military aid to the region, but believes more can be done to speed things up. ""We just have to take every opportunity to increase production and improve the flow, because it is going to make a difference,"" he said. The U.S. has not sent Ukraine any of its M1 Abrams tanks, officials saying they are too different from Ukraine's T-72s to be useable in the short term. But other nations with the Soviet-era tanks have given theirs. In total, Ukrainian forces have more tanks in their country than Russia's military, a senior U.S. defense official said Thursday. A less tangible but very real factor in the fighting so far has been troop morale. The Pentagon sees evidence Russian forces are still suffering from low motivation and poor unit cohesion, according to officials. ""Almost half of their enlisted troops are conscripts who don't receive a lot of training and who we have evidence, even recent evidence, that they've been disillusioned by this war,"" the senior U.S. defense official said. Meanwhile Russian officers are frustrated with the performance of other officers and of their own troops, according to the official. Ukrainian troops have not seemed to suffer any significant morale problems, and throughout the war have been described by U.S. officials as brave and wily in defense of their homeland. Biden praised the resolve of Ukrainians in a meeting with top military leaders at the White House Wednesday. ""I knew they were tough and proud, but I tell you what, they're tougher and more proud than I thought,"" Biden said.",7,,,,13
2022-04-21,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/biden-announce-800m-aid-package-ukraine-russia-presses/story?id=84194608,Biden announces new $800M aid package to Ukraine as Russia presses offensive,"President Joe Biden on Thursday announced an additional $800 million package in military assistance to Ukraine -- as well as a ban on all Russian-affiliated ships from U.S. ports -- as Russian forces launch a long-expected, large-scale campaign to seize the country's east. ""We're in a critical window now of time where -- they're going to set the stage for the next phase of this war,"" Biden said from the White House Roosevelt Room, adding the U.S. and allies will continue to provide Ukraine with ""equipment they need -- their forces need -- to defend their nation."" Biden said the new aid package will include ""heavy artillery weapons, dozens of howitzers, and 144,000 rounds of ammunition to go with those howitzers,"" as well as tactical drones. It follows another of similar size, which Biden announced last week, but focuses more on artillery and ammunition, U.S. officials told ABC News earlier this week. Biden said the U.S. has sent ""equipment that is responsive to Ukraine's needs and tailored to support the intensified fighting in the Donbas region, which is a different war than in other places because both topographically, it's different -- it's flat, it's not in the mountains -- and it requires different kinds of weapons to be more effective."" ""Every American taxpayer, every member of our armed forces can be proud of the fact that our country's generosity -- and the skill and service of our military -- helped arm and repel Russia's aggression in Ukraine to beat back Putin's savagery that tried to seize Ukraine's capital and wipe out Ukraine's government,"" Biden added. Detailing capabilities in the package, the Pentagon said 72 more howitzers and the vehicles to tow them onto the battlefield are being sent to Ukraine, reflecting the importance of howitzer artillery in fighting in the Donbas, where the terrain is wide and open. When combined with the 18 howitzers announced last week, the 90 howitzers in total headed to Ukraine “provides enough artillery systems to equip five battalions,"" according to the Pentagon. As the fighting progresses, there are concerns about getting American-made artillery into the region, also reflected in that this is the bulk of the new aid package. With this latest package, the U.S. has announced more than $3 billion in military aid since the start started in late February. In particular, this is the eighth tranche of U.S. assistance from the Pentagon's existing stockpile, using what's known as presidential drawdown authority to expedite delivery. As more than 5 million have fled Ukraine since the war began, Biden also announced a new program dubbed ""Unite for Ukraine"" to fast-track Ukrainian refugees coming to the U.S. ""This new humanitarian parole program will complement the existing legal pathways available to Ukrainians, including immigrant visas and refugees processing"" and ""provide an expedient channel for secure legal migration from Europe to the United States for Ukrainians, who have a U.S. sponsor such as a family or an NGO,"" Biden said. Beginning April 25, the administration says U.S.-based individuals and entities can apply to the Department of Homeland Security to sponsor Ukrainian citizens. Those who apply to sponsor Ukrainians will be required to declare their financial support and pass a background check, according to administration officials, and there is no limit on how many Ukrainians a person or entity can sponsor. ""This program will be fast, it will be streamlined, and will ensure the United States honors its commitment to go to the people of Ukraine and need not go through our southern border,"" Biden added. As he continues to ramp up pressure on Putin, Biden said the U.S. will also ban all Russian-affiliated ships from its ports. ""That means no ship, no ship that sails on the Russian flag or that is owned or operated by Russian interest would be allowed to dock on the united States port or access our shores. None,"" he said. After meeting with Ukraine's Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal ahead of his remarks, Biden again called on Congress to provide more funding for weapons and ammunition because existing money is ""almost exhausted,"" he said, even with an additional $500 million in economic aid to Ukraine's government the Treasury Department also announced Thursday, separate from the latest $800 million military package. Russia offered another ultimatum Wednesday to allow Ukrainian fighters to leave a steel plant in Mariupol -- but those fighters, for days, have refused to surrender. Finally seizing the strategic port city after weeks of besiegement and bombardment would help give Russian forces a land bridge between Crimea, which Russia has occupied since 2014, and the eastern provinces known as the Donbas, where Russian-led separatists have battled the Ukrainian government since 2014, too. The Donbas is expected to be Russia's focus now, but the U.S. remains concerned that Russian forces will target the paths in western Ukraine being used to ship Western military aid into the country, a defense official told ABC News. While they have not done so yet, cutting off those supply routes will help the Kremlin isolate Ukrainian forces in the east, the official added. The U.S. believes Russians will target the paths in western Ukraine being used to ship in Western military aid in order to isolate Ukrainian forces in the east, a defense official told ABC News. ""Right now, we know from our discussions with the Ukrainians that they are getting this material,"" a defense official said Tuesday. ""It's getting into the hands of their fighters."" The U.S. and other Western countries have now provided Ukraine with close to 70,000 anti-tank weapons, including several varieties of shoulder-fired missiles. The number of shoulder-fired anti-aircraft missiles that the U.S. and other countries have sent to Ukraine is nearing 30,000. Those missiles have been used by Ukrainian forces to great effect, but as the battle shifts from Ukraine's major cities and suburbs to the more flat eastern provinces, Kyiv's troops will need more artillery and ammunition instead. Four flights carrying military aid from the $800 million drawdown package Biden announced last week arrived in Ukraine over the last 24 hours, some of them carrying U.S. howitzers and 155mm ammunition for them, a senior defense official said Wednesday, adding more equipment will arrive over the next 24 hours. ABC News asked the official why the U.S. decided to send U.S. artillery to the Ukrainians. ""We're mindful of the importance of artillery in the fight that they're in right now and in the fighting in the days to come because of the terrain, and because of what we think they're going to be up against with Russian forces,"" the official responded. Another reason was ""the fact that it wouldn't require an onerous amount of training for the Ukrainians to know how to use them"" and the ability to ship them quickly, according to the official. After Biden called Russia's actions in Ukraine ""genocide"" for the first time last week, Secretary of State Antony Blinken warned Wednesday that the same horrors witnessed in Bucha -- ""death, destruction, atrocities"" -- may take place in the eastern city of Mariupol ""at some point,"" even as Russian forces seem already poised to fully capture the strategic city. ""We can only anticipate that when this tide also at some point recedes from Mariupol, we're going to see far worse -- if that's possible to imagine,"" Blinken said. ""So the conditions there, the situation there as a result of this Russian aggression are truly horrific.""",49,,,,13
2022-04-21,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/International/russians-calling-ukrainians-lay-arms-civilians-sheltering/story?id=84188159,"Situation in Azovstal steel plant 'desperate,' Ukraine says","Ukraine claimed on Thursday that hundreds of people remain trapped in the Azovstal steel plant where the situation has become ""desparate."" Ukraine's Ministry of Foreign Affairs claimed the Ukrainian army continues to fight in the besieged Mariupol, saying that the situation in Azovstal is ""desparate"" with hundreds of civilians, children and injured fighters trapped in the plant with nearly no food, water or essential medicine. ""Azovstal is being constantly bombarded by Russia despite large numbers of civilians sheltering there. Ukrainians don't trust [Russian] troops, are afraid of being deported, killed. An urgent humanitarian corridor is needed from the Azovstal plant with guarantees people will be safe,"" the Ukrainian MFA said in a tweet. Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered Russian troops not to attack the Azovstal plant, in a televised meeting with defense minister Sergei Shoigu. Shoigu said it would take Russian forces three to four days to take control of the industrial zone of the plant. Putin also claimed the Mariupol operation a success, congratulating his defense minister and thanking Russian troops. ""The completion of the combat work to liberate Mariupol is a success,"" Putin told Shoigu on Thursday. ""I congratulate you. Convey words of gratitude to the troops."" Ukraine's presidential adviser Oleksiy Arestovich addressed Putin's comments in a press conference Thursday and said that Ukrainian troops continue to hold the plant and Russia would not storm Azovstal because they have suffered huge losses and redeployed some of their troops. A Ukrainian commander of the regiment at that factory said Ukrainian troops there are ready to surrender if they can be guaranteed protection by a third party and are allowed to take the bodies of their dead with them. Ukrainian President Volodomyr Zelenskyy's office called for negotiations inside Mariupol to get anyone left in the factory out of the area alive. President Joe Biden pushed back against Putin's claim that Russian forces have taken control of Mariupol. ""It's questionable whether he does control Mariupol. One thing for sure we know about Mariupol, he should allow humanitarian corridors to let people on that steel mill and other places are buried under rubble to get out. That's what any head of state would do in such a circumstance,"" Biden said. ""There is no evidence yet that Mariupol has completely fallen,"" he added. On Wednesday, Russia's military issued another warning to Ukrainian forces at the plant, telling them to lay down their arms and leave, according to Russian state media. Russia claimed a ceasefire would begin at the Azovstal steel plant at 2 p.m. Moscow time on Wednesday to allow Ukrainian fighters to safely leave. Ukrainian forces rejected a similar offer on Tuesday. The Mariupol city council claimed Tuesday that there are at least 1,000 civilians seeking shelter in the plant, mostly women with children and the elderly. Ukrainian authorities have not confirmed the number of Ukrainian marines and fighters at the site. A Russian official, Dmitry Polyansky, accused Ukrainian troops of using civilians at the plant as human shields. ""One month into the siege of Azovstal plant, those same radicals and neo-Nazis suddenly declared that allegedly there had been civilians inside the plant all that time, even though until yesterday, they had never uttered a word about it,"" Polyansky told the U.N. Security Council during a session on Ukraine on Tuesday. In a video posted online, Serhiy Voyna, the commander of the 36th Separate Marine Brigade and commander for Ukraine's marines in Mariupol, made an appeal to world leaders, asking for an extraction from the plant to the territory of a third-party state. ""This could be the last appeal of our lives. We are probably facing our last days, if not hours. The enemy is outnumbering us 10 to 1. They have advantage in the air, in artillery, in their forces on land, in equipment and in tanks,"" Voyna said. Voyna spoke to the Washington Post via satellite phone on Tuesday, and said his forces would not make the same mistake made by others and trust Russian guarantees of safe passage, only to see them open fire. Voyna said more than 500 Mariupol military battalion soldiers are wounded. ""We are only defending one object, the Azovstal plant where, in addition to military personnel, there are also civilians who have fallen victim to this war. We appeal and plead to all world leaders to help us. We ask them to use the procedure of 'extraction' and take us to the territory of a third-party state,"" Voyna said.",47,,,,15
2022-04-19,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/russian-offensive-limited-fall-mariupol-inevitable-pentagon-update/story?id=84171542,"Russian offensive 'limited' so far, fall of Mariupol 'not inevitable': Pentagon update Day 55","The Pentagon has been providing daily updates on the U.S. assessment of the Russian invasion of Ukraine and Ukraine's efforts to resist. Here are highlights of what a senior U.S. defense official told reporters Tuesday on Day 55. 'Limited' Russian offensive operations so far in eastern Ukraine The U.S. has seen ""limited"" Russian offensive operations southwest of Donetsk and south of Izium, but these are believed to be ""preludes to larger offensive operations that the Russians plan to conduct,"" a senior U.S. defense official said. ""These are actual ground offensives, and they are being supported, of course, by some long-range fires, mostly artillery, which is right out of the Russian doctrine,"" the official said. But while there is ongoing fighting in the region, a more devastating offensive is still in the works. ""You've seen comments by [Ukraine's] President Zelenskyy yesterday, and even for [Russian Foreign Minister] Lavrov, about this new offensive beginning ... We think that these ... are preludes to larger offensive operations that the Russians plan to conduct. So, we're not pushing back on the notion that offensive operations have begun, but again, we think that this is a prelude of larger offensive operations that are potentially still in the offing here,"" the official said. The Pentagon believes Russia's military is working to learn from its mistakes fighting in the north, where it was plagued with logistical and supply problems, conducting what officials call ""shaping operations"" to set favorable conditions on the battlefield before beginning its new offensive in earnest. ""In other words, continue to reinforce, continue to make sure they have logistics and sustainment in place, continue to make sure that they have proper aviation and other enabling capability,"" the official said. Over the last 24 hours, two Russian battalion tactical groups (BTGs), or up to 2,000 more combat troops, have been sent into Ukraine, according to the official. This brings the total to an estimated 78 BTGs inside the country, all in the south and east. About 75% of Putin's total combat power originally arrayed against Ukraine remains, according to the official. This takes into account all military capabilities, including troop casualties, destroyed vehicles and aircraft, and expended missiles. This is the lowest assessment we've heard out of the Pentagon. Fall of Mariupol and Donbas 'not inevitable' ""People speak about this as if it's inevitable, that Mariupol is going to fall, that it's inevitable that Donbas will be taken by the Russians. We don't see it that way. And we're doing everything we can to make sure that it's not inevitable,"" the official said. With fighting concentrated around Donbas, Ukraine has to move aid coming in from the U.S. and others all the way across the country. ""Right now we know from our discussions with the Ukrainians that they are getting this materiel, it's getting into the hands of their fighters,"" the official said. But Russia aims to isolate Ukrainian forces in the east. ""Clearly what the Russians want to do is cut them off and to defeat them in the Donbas,"" the official said, reiterating that defeat is not inevitable. Ukraine has more operable planes than 2 weeks ago At a separate briefing later Tuesday, Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said Ukraine currently has more operable military planes right now than it did two weeks ago because Ukraine has received additional aircraft as well as parts to get damaged planes flying again. Kirby was reticent to provide any details on where the parts and planes came from but stressed that they did not come from the U.S. ""They have received additional aircraft and aircraft parts to help them get more aircraft in the air,"" Kirby said at the on-camera briefing at the Pentagon. “And that's not by accident, that's because other nations who had experience with those kinds of aircraft have been able to help them get more aircraft up and running,” said Kirby. ""We certainly have helped with the trans-shipment of some additional spare parts that have helped with their aircraft needs, but we have not transported whole aircraft,"" he said. Russian missile strikes The U.S. assesses Russia has fired at least 1,670 missiles against Ukraine since the beginning of the invasion. The official noted that bad weather lowers visibility, making it harder for the U.S. to observe launches and other battlefield actions, so the actual number could be higher. Despite the recent airstrikes in Kyiv and Lviv, Russia's firepower is focused on Mariupol and Donbas.",7,,,,14
2022-04-19,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/International/russia-begins-long-feared-offensive-ukraines-east/story?id=84161008,Russia begins long-feared offensive in Ukraine's east,"LONDON -- Russia launched an all-out ground offensive to take control of eastern Ukraine late Monday, marking the long-feared start of a new phase of the nearly two-month-long war. Ukrainian officials said Russian forces were attacking along a nearly 300-mile front in the disputed Donbas region, the predominately Russian-speaking industrial heartland of Ukraine's east, where Russia-backed separatists have been fighting Ukrainian soldiers since 2014 and have declared two independent republics recognized by Moscow. ""Russian troops have begun the battle for Donbas, for which they have been preparing for a long time,"" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy announced late Tuesday in his nightly broadcast. ""A very large part of the entire Russian army is now focused on this offensive."" Since invading neighboring Ukraine on Feb. 24 from Belarus, to the north, and Russia, to the east, Russian forces have struggled to take full control of major cities amid strong resistance from Ukrainian troops. After failing to seize the capital, Kyiv, Russian forces retreated from northern Ukraine and have been regrouping in the east in recent weeks in preparation for a full-scale assault, as Russian officials declared ""liberating"" the Donbas as the main goal of the ""special military operation."" On Tuesday morning, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov announced that ""another stage of this operation is beginning."" ""I am sure this will be a very important moment of this entire special operation,"" Lavrov said in an interview with India Today, an English-language Indian television network. Lavrov noted that the objective, ""as it was declared from the very start,"" was to ""fully liberate"" the self-proclaimed Donetsk and Luhansk people's republics in the Donbas. The Russian military called on the outnumbered Ukrainian fighters in the besieged port city of Mariupol in eastern Ukraine's Donetsk Oblast to surrender by midday. The Russian Ministry of Defense said it was ready to declare a temporary ceasefire in Mariupol on Tuesday from 1:30 p.m. local time. Col. Gen. Mikhail Mizintsev, head of Russia's National Defense Control Center, told Russian state media on Tuesday that Ukrainian troops holed up on the grounds of the Azovstal Iron and Steel Works plant in Mariupol had until 12 p.m. local time to stop all fighting and lay down their arms. Moscow has proposed this plan ""given the catastrophic situation in the Azovstal Iron and Steel Works, as well as for purely humanitarian considerations,"" according to Mizintsev. ""All those who will lay down arms are guaranteed that their lives will be spared,"" he added. ""The actual start of the temporary ceasefire shall be marked by both sides by raising flags -- red flags by the Russian side and white flags by the Ukrainian side along the entire perimeter of Azovstal. Furthermore, their readiness to put the temporary ceasefire into effect shall be confirmed by the sides via all communication channels."" According to Mizintsev, ""absolutely all"" Ukrainian troops and foreign mercenaries would have been allowed to leave the plant without any weapons or ammunition from 2 p.m. to 4 p.m. local time. Moscow guaranteed to each Ukrainian soldier who surrenders that their life will be spared and their rights as prisoners of war will be respected, Mizintsev said. The territory of the giant Azovstal plant is the last holdout for the Ukrainian resistance in Mariupol. The Mariupol City Council has previously said there are at least 1,000 people, including Ukrainian troops, on the grounds of the plant. Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said Monday that civilians, including women and children, were also sheltering there. She called for an ""urgent humanitarian corridor"" to allow them to evacuate. Eduard Basurin, a spokesperson for the militia of the self-declared Donetsk People's Republic, told Russian state media on Tuesday that separatist special forces were chosen to assist the Russian military in storming the Azovstal plant. Basurin said they have already started the operation in Mariupol, with Russian forces providing air and artillery support. The Ukrainian government did not immediately confirm the claim. However, Ukrainian military spokesperson Oleksandr Shtupun said Tuesday that Russian forces were intensifying their attacks in the east, with a focus on breaching Ukrainian defenses in the Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts, as well as establishing full control of Mariupol. Weeks of relentless Russian bombardment have largely reduced Mariupol to rubble and killed thousands of residents, according to local officials. Capturing the city -- a strategically important port on the Sea of Azov, part of the Black Sea -- is the remaining obstacle to Russia's push to secure a coastal corridor to Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula, which Russian forces invaded and subsequently annexed in 2014. Earlier this month, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg warned that a full-scale ground offensive by Russia in Ukraine's east would be ""a crucial phase of the war.""",47,,,,11

Here are highlights of what a senior U.S. defense official told reporters Monday on Day 54. Russia 'shaping' the battlefield for renewed offensive There are now 76 Russian battalion tactical groups (BTGs) inside Ukraine, all of them in the south and east. Each BTG is made up of roughly 800-1,000 soldiers. That's up from 65 BTGs last week, so as many 11,000 troops have crossed the border since then, the senior defense official said. Last week, the U.S. mostly saw support forces convoying into the Donbas region, but BTGs are Russia's primary fighting units. Artillery, helicopter support and command and control elements have continued to flow in. In a separate briefing, Pentagon press secretary John Kirby told reporters Monday that while there is currently fighting in Donbas, as there has been for years, defense officials do not believe Russia's new offensive push has begun. ""We believe that the Russians are shaping and setting the conditions for future offensive operations,"" Kirby said. That shaping effort appears to be an attempt by Russia to avoid blunders it made during combat operations in northern Ukraine. ""We believe that they are trying to learn from from past mistakes, and you can see that in just the way they are conducting these shaping operations,"" Kirby said. ""They're conducting themselves in ways that we didn't see around Kyiv, for instance."" While Russian forces are ""trying to set the conditions for more aggressive, more overt, and larger ground maneuvers in the Donbas,"" Kirby said Ukrainian troops are not sitting idle. ""We have seen indications in just the last few days that the Ukrainians not only have have defended bravely, but they have been able to secure certain villages and towns in the Donbas,"" Kirby said. There are another 22 or so BTGs still in Russia north of Ukraine, most likely refitting and resupplying after being depleted form earlier combat in northern Ukraine, according to a defense official. The official noted that if Russia takes Mariupol, it would free up close to another 12 BTGs (roughly 8,800-12,000 troops) that could be used for fighting elsewhere in the south or east. Mariupol Ukrainian forces continue fighting to push back Russian troops in Mariupol, according to the official. The city is still under threat of missile and artillery bombardment. Kyiv and lviv under long-range fire Russian long-range bombers have hit both Kyiv and Lviv with air-launched cruise missiles over the last couple of days, according to the official. ""Our initial assessment is that they were going after primarily military targets, or what they believed to be military targets,"" the official said. During his press briefing, Kirby said the U.S. is still assessing what the Russian's hit in the two cities, but added that most Russian airstrikes are being directed on the east and south of Ukraine, especially Mariupol. The Moskva The U.S. can't verify authenticity of videos purportedly showing Russia's Moskva cruiser sinking, ""but the images themselves comport with what we had assessed to be the damage done to the ship,"" the official said. The official said the U.S. was able to see Russian sailors board lifeboats before the ship sank, but could not confirm how many casualties there might have been. ""It's hard to look at the damage that was done without generally assuming that there were also casualties, that she lost sailors. How many, we just don't know,"" the official said. First shipments of new $800 million US aid package arrive ""Based on the last $800 million that the President authorized that we just announced last week, already there have been four flights from the United States arriving into the theater just yesterday,"" the official said. US to train Ukrainians on artillery In coming days, the U.S. plans to facilitate training for Ukrainians on the howitzers it's sending them, according to the official. The 18 howitzers heading to Ukraine will come from a mix of U.S. Army and Marine Corps stocks. ABC News' Luis Martinez contributed to this report.",7,,,,14
2022-04-18,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/International/takes-prosecute-war-crimes/story?id=83915800,What it takes to prosecute war crimes,"As Russian forces retreated from northern Ukraine, atrocities were revealed and the U.S. and European countries accused Russia of committing war crimes. Last month, the U.S. made a formal legal assessment that Russian forces have committed war crimes in Ukraine. Ukrainian officials Friday said they found more than 900 bodies of civilians in the Kyiv region after Russian forces retreated, 350 of which were found in the town of Bucha. Geoffrey Nice, a barrister who prosecuted former Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic in the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, told ABC News it is obvious that war crimes are being committed in Ukraine. ""Without doubt. It's clear as conveyed from everything we're watching every day on television,"" Nice said. In March, days after the war began, the International Criminal Court announced it is launching an investigation into possible war crimes committed in Ukraine. This story explains what it takes to prosecute war crimes. What is a war crime? War crimes are a part of the law of armed conflict, which governs fighting during war, and apply to all sides of an armed conflict, including armed forces and organized armed groups. These rules are laid out in the Geneva Conventions and their additional protocols. Individuals could also be held responsible or prosecuted for serious violations of the law of armed conflict or a grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions, Tom Dannenbaum, an assistant professor of International Law at Tufts University's Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy, told ABC News in an interview. ""These rules go all the way down the command chain, and indeed all the way up the command chain. ... Any individual from the lowest level physical perpetrator to the highest level commander is potentially implicated, or is at least governed by this law,"" Dannenbaum said. These violations include attacking civilians and their structures, killings, cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment, torture or sexual and gender-based crimes, such as rape, according to Dannenbaum. Jurisdiction and forums for prosecution There are several forums where war crimes can be prosecuted. In Ukraine, this includes the ICC, domestic courts and courts in countries that have universal jurisdiction. Ukraine has consented to the jurisdiction of the ICC, which can prosecute four main crimes: genocide; crimes against humanity, including murder, rape, imprisonment, deportation and torture; war crimes that breach the Geneva conventions; and the crime of aggression. In order for individuals to stand trial in the ICC, they must voluntarily consent to it or be handed over to the court. Russia does not recognize the jurisdiction of the ICC and is not required to hand over suspects who are indicted. Domestic courts in Ukraine can prosecute war crimes since the crimes occurred within their territorial jurisdiction, and Russian courts can prosecute crimes involving their citizens, based on nationality jurisdiction. Universal jurisdiction exists in some countries, including Australia, France and Germany, allowing them to prosecute individuals for crimes committed out of their territory. The individuals do not need to be citizens of the prosecuting country nor does the crime have to have been committed against its citizens. ""It asserts universal jurisdiction on the grounds that this particular crime is a crime that is of universal interest,"" Dannenbaum said. The U.S. does not allow its courts to exercise universal jurisdiction. Evidence gathering and investigating Investigators divide evidence into two categories: crime based and linkage evidence, according to William Wiley, founder and executive director of the Commission for International Justice and Accountability, who has over 20 years experience in International Criminal and Humanitarian Law on the investigative and legal sides. To collect crime based evidence, investigators gather basic facts like such as cause of death, or probable cause of death, time of death, and location of death, Wiley said. ""Crime based, for example, in the well known situation of Bucha, in Ukraine, would be the dead bodies, eye witnesses to the killing of those individuals,"" Wiley said. Crime based evidence makes up a small portion of cases; ""90% of the work in an international criminal investigation, the prosecution is focused on gathering and analysis of linkage evidence,"" Wiley said. Investigators will be looking for ""linkage evidence between those who performed the wrongful act on the ground and any other actors that are potentially going to be subject to investigation and prosecution, particularly those up the chain of command,"" Dannenbaum said. Linkage evidence can include documents, documentary materials generated, communications, satellite imagery or insider witnesses. Investigators are looking for evidence that could establish intent. Finding sufficient linkage evidence is the main challenge prosecutors and investigators face, Wiley said. ""What it takes to prosecute a war crime is a great deal of evidence because ultimately, war crimes cases are are brought against higher level perpetrators who need a great deal of linkage material and connect somebody in Moscow to offenses perpetrated in, for instance, Bucha,"" Wiley said. But Ukraine appears to be gathering communications evidence ""in considerable volumes ... because the Russian operational security appears to be extremely poor. They're not using frequently encrypted communications devices, certainly on the tactical and operational level,"" Wiley said. Nice disagreed, and said there doesn't need to be a huge amount of evidence. The war ""was associated with war crimes right from the very beginning. Never been any doubt about that,"" said Nice. He added, ""There doesn't necessarily need to be a huge amount of evidence because it is so overwhelmingly clear."" Suspects are identified late in the investigative process. Investigators start by gathering evidence surrounding the perpetrating structures, then they link those crimes to a crime base, and finally they work toward identifying suspects, Wiley said. ""Ultimately, it's not Russia that is going to be put on trial ... it's individual suspects,"" Wiley said. The legal principle of command responsibility states that commanders are responsible for the conduct their subordinates, Wiley said. This runs all the way up the command chain, including Russian President Vladimir Putin. This rules out the possibility of higher ranking officials claiming they were unaware of the actions committed by their forces. ""For instance, in Bucha, this is not going to be an effective defense because the law of command responsibility imposes a requirement on commanders to be aware, at all times, of what their men are up to,"" Wiley said. Could Russian forces and leadership face prosecution? Experts agree that it is unlikely the highest-ranking officials will be prosecuted, but Russian forces could be. There is a ""fairly strong prospect"" for Russian forces to be sent to trial because a number of them have been captured by Ukraine and because there is ""an unprecedented level of international cooperation around gathering evidence, making sure it's preserved,"" Dannenbaum said. Dannenbaum said countries are providing the ICC with additional resources, including financial support and investigative teams. Wiley also thinks forces will be prosecuted. ""I don't think there's going to be a problem getting some Russian perpetrators into court. The fundamental question is, what ranks will they hold, or will they have held,"" Wiley said. ""However, there's a great many Russian soldiers, and paramilitary personnel connected to the Russian security intelligence services, who've been captured by the Ukrainians,"" Wiley said. But the likelihood of Putin or other high-ranking Russian officials being prosecuted is not high. ""It's much less likely that those individuals will come into the custody of the jurisdictions that would seek to prosecute them. And Putin himself has an additional wrinkle, which is a concept called head of state immunity, which makes it difficult to prosecute Putin in domestic courts,"" Dannenbaum. But he could be prosecuted in the ICC. If there is regime change in Russia, he could be tried, Nice said. ""If there's a regime change in Russia, as there was in Serbia, which led to the former Serbian President being handed over, then he may be tried,"" Nice said.",45,,,,10
2022-04-14,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/preemptive-public-us-strikes-winning-intelligence-war-russia/story?id=84015518,"Preemptive, public US strikes winning intelligence war with Russia: ANALYSIS","For years, the Kremlin's power to weave disinformation into a believable narrative was a seemingly ever-present boogeyman, threatening to disrupt elections and sew discord thousands of miles away from Moscow. Then, as Russia prepared to invade Ukraine, the tide started to turn. From the time the Kremlin claimed the troop buildup on its neighbor's border was simply a training exercise, the U.S. has been able to turn one of its powerful assets -- classified intelligence -- into an effective tool by making it public, undercutting Russian forces before they could carry out their next moves. CIA Director Bill Burns explained the administration's approach in a speech at Georgia Tech on Thursday, saying that at President Joe Biden's direction, the U.S. government had taken ""unprecedented steps to declassify intelligence and use it publicly to preempt the false narratives"" spun by Russian leader Vladimir Putin, making it harder to ""obscure the truth of his unprovoked and vicious aggression."" ""Those decisions can never be taken lightly given the importance of protecting sources and methods,"" he said. ""But in this case, they have made a crucial contribution to a successful whole of government strategy."" While these disclosures have so far proven effective in uniting the West and indeed, much of the world, against Russia, whether the U.S. can maintain the upper hand in a realm traditionally dominated by Russia is still an open question. ABC News spoke with several experts on Russia disinformation and the U.S. strategy of selectively releasing intelligence to counter it. Waving the 'false flag' Over a month before the attack on Ukraine began, U.S. officials sounded the alarm, warning they had credible evidence that Russia might attempt a ""false flag operation""-- manufacturing a pretext to justify an invasion. While this revelation did not deter Moscow from moving in, experts say it still made a profound difference. ""If they could have done a decent false flag operation, then it would have given some audiences reason to believe that them,"" said Todd Helmus, a senior behavioral scientist at the RAND Corporation specializing in disinformation and countering Russian disinformation and a former deployed adviser to U.S. military commanders, told ABC News. ""That could have sown some disunity in the western response or possibly made support for Ukraine a partisan issue. The release of intelligence took that away from Russia."" Helmus says the U.S. striking first was critical. ""That's the key thing in propaganda wars -- the first person to get their message out really owns that space,"" he said. ""So for the U.S. to do the pre-bunking, they immediately own the space and put Russia on flat foot."" After their strategy was disrupted at the jump, Russia has been unable to effectively recast the reasoning for its invasion, or portray its campaign as successful to a broad audience, according to Helmus. ""It's hard to put lipstick on a pig as they say,"" he said. ""So much is going poorly for Russia that it makes it hard for them to properly message it."" Emily Harding is deputy director of the International Security Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies and previously served as deputy staff director of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. She says that while parts of the U.S.'s strategy may seem like common sense, it's nonetheless surprising to see the country take such a proactive approach. ""It's so shocking. The U.S. government in general is poorly placed to mix it up in the information space,"" Harding said, citing the inherent limits imposed by a democratic government with strict rules regarding influencing the public and a bureaucracy that typically ensures the declassification process is slow-moving. In recent weeks, the U.S. has gone so far as to share intelligence on the inner workings of the Kremlin, asserting that Russian president Vladimir Putin is being misinformed by his advisors because ""they are too afraid to tell the truth"" about their military's failures in Ukraine—a move Harding says could be aimed at shaking the confidence of the country's elite. ""If you're loyal to Putin, what you're assuming is that this guy knows what he's doing,"" she said. ""A release like that might undermine that judgment."" ""I think what's been good about these releases is that the public has seen just how good the intelligence community is at anticipating some events, at reading our adversaries, and then at providing policymakers the actionable intelligence they need to make a good decision,"" she said. ""Of many things in this conflict, people are going to look back at the early stages as an information warfare success."" Meanwhile, Sarah Oates, an expert on Russian media and propaganda at the Wilson Center, says that while the Kremlin was extremely disciplined and adept in its anti-democratic propaganda and portrayal of NATO as an enemy force out to destroy Russia, Putin veered off course in the final days before the invasion. ""In many ways, we can see the invasion of Ukraine as kind of a natural outcome of this propaganda warfare that's been going on for years and even decades,"" she said. ""On the other hand, in February, Putin goes completely off script. He just delves into the world of fantasy. He's all the sudden talking about things that are completely implausible and very deniable."" Oates says following the invasion, Russia -- grasping at straws -- has reverted to its traditional disinformation tactics. But now, they're falling flat. ""I can still see echoes of that in the current information warfare strategy that Russia has carried out, particularly in the so called biological labs myth. But in general, it's bad. It's just bad. This is not effective propaganda,"" she said. Truth and consequences While declassifying information has proven successful thus far, there are limits to the strategy -- and risks that come along with it. ""As a former intelligence professional, every time you see information declassified, it first of all makes you swell with pride, but then also strikes terror into your heart. You're very proud because you know what the intelligence community is capable of,"" Harding said. ""You also know what sacrifices were made in order to obtain that information and you worry about what the consequences might be. There are always consequences."" She says she is confident the administration is running a comprehensive cost-benefit analysis before any information is released, and a senior intelligence official tells ABC News that ""standard declassification procedures, which are in place to protect sources and methods were followed. Still, Harding notes that repercussions can be dire—including destroying invaluable working relationships with other countries and ""the potential for a human being put in tremendous danger."" Oates says there are more abstract limitations working against U.S. transparency as well, such as inadvertently providing fodder to the opposition. ""It is difficult because when we release information, it can be manipulated and used against us and woven into their narrative, like Undersecretary of State Victoria Nuland trying to say at a congressional hearing 'well, yes, Ukraine does have biological laboratories for research,"" she said, pointing out how that innocuous revelation has been twisted by various sources to claim the country is secretly developing biological weapons. ""It's like -- no, she didn't say that."" ""It's just two completely different systems. And, in general, the Russian propaganda system has been able to run rings around the open media system of the United States,"" Oates continued. ""Relying on people to have news literacy or to check their sources is a little weak."" A Russian resurgence? Even if Russia has lost the information battle, it doesn't mean it's lost the information war. ""I don't know what they got in their pocket,"" said Helmus. ""They're pretty good at adapting. Their campaign targeting the U.S. in 2016 was full of adaption. They may play that game of 'this isn't working, let's try this."" Harding fears Russian failures could push the Kremlin to new extremes. ""I am very concerned that the Russian government is going to be a bit of a wounded animal right now and that they're going to look for ways to strike out,"" she said. And Harding says the impact of that strike could be felt much closer to home. ""They're a big government. They can walk and chew gum at the same time,"" she said. ""I think that it's still entirely possible that they will be trying to play in our 2022 elections, that they'll still be trying to sow divisions within American society, especially as this war rolls on.""

2022-04-13,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/International/tens-thousands-feared-dead-mariupol-russia-renews-assault/story?id=84032405,Tens of thousands feared dead in Mariupol as Russia renews assault in eastern Ukraine,"LONDON -- Tens of thousands of civilians could be dead in Mariupol, the city's mayor said, as analysts warn that Russia is regrouping for a renewed assault on eastern Ukraine. The streets in Mariupol are “carpeted” with bodies, Vadym Boychenko, the mayor of Mariupol, said Monday. While there is no confirmed number of casualties, the mayor suggested the number of dead could be well over 10,000 in the coastal town, the site of some of the worst bombardment since the Russian invasion of Ukraine began. ""If it is possible to mention such a terrifying number, then it is above 10,000. According to our estimates, it is 20,000 plus, unfortunately,” Boychenko said in an interview with the Associated Press. Russian airstrikes have battered the southeastern city over the past few weeks targeting all kinds of buildings, including a theatre housing those seeking refuge, a maternity hospital and an art school. Officials say that over 80 percent of the city is destroyed. With the city almost completely cut off from the outside world, it has been difficult for the authorities to verify atrocities alleged to have been committed on the ground, including claims made Monday by the Azov battalion, a far-right group now part of the Ukrainian National Guard, that Russia may have used chemical weapons against the Ukrainian forces in the city. The claims could not be independently verified by ABC News. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's office and the country's ministry of defense said they are investigating the claims. “We are currently confirming this information, trying to understand what it was. According to preliminary information, we can say that it is possible– that it was, rather, a phosphorous munition. Official information will be finalized later,"" Hanna Maliar, Deputy Minister of Defence, said during a national news broadcast. A spokesman for Russian-backed separatists, Eduard Basurin, was quoted by the Interfax news agency as saying Tuesday that they ""haven't used any chemical weapons in Mariupol."" But on the eve of the alleged attack, Basurin made the case on Russian TV that his forces should use chemical weapons against Ukrainian troops to ""smoke them out."" Late on Monday, Pentagon spokesman John Kirby issued a statement saying that the use of a substance cannot be confirmed, but expressed concerns about Russia’s potential use of “riot control agents including tear gas mixed with chemical agents.” “We are aware of social media reports which claim Russian forces deployed a potential chemical munition in Mariupol, Ukraine. We cannot confirm at this time and will continue to monitor the situation closely. These reports, if true, are deeply concerning and reflective of concerns that we have had about Russia’s potential to use a variety of riot control agents, including tear gas mixed with chemical agents, in Ukraine,” the statement reads. Britain's armed forces minister said on Tuesday that should Russia resort to the use of chemical weapons in the eastern Ukrainian city of Mariupol, ""all possible options are on the table in terms of how the West might respond” in response to the speculation, saying the reports had not been verified. Whether or not phosphorous is considered a chemical weapon is a topic of debate among militaries and governments. Although phosphorus is not classified as a chemical weapon under the Chemical Weapons Convention, the Geneva Convention forbids its use as an incendiary weapon in civilian areas. Amidst the reports of Russia regrouping behind its own borders, the British Ministry of Defense warned today that the fighting is set to intensify over the next two-three weeks with a renewed assault. “Fighting in eastern Ukraine will intensify over the next two to three weeks as Russia continues to refocus its efforts there,” the U.K.'s ministry of defense stated in a tweet. “Russian attacks remain focused on Ukrainian positions near Donetsk and Luhansk with further fighting around Kherson and Mykolaiv and a renewed push towards Kramatorsk. Russian forces continue to withdraw from Belarus in order to redeploy in support of operations in eastern Ukraine,"" the post added.",47,,,,15

Pentagon press secretary John Kirby walked reporters through the aid package in an afternoon press briefing, saying it includes ""new capabilities that we have not provided to Ukraine."" ""We committed from the very beginning even before the invasion, to helping Ukraine be able to defend itself. This is a piece of that. And this is representative of the kinds of capabilities that the Ukrainians themselves have asked for and said they need as this fighting now gets focused on the eastern part of the country,"" he said. ""How that gets interpreted by the Russians. you can ask Mr. Putin and the Kremlin,"" Kirby added. Biden announced the $800 million package in an earlier written statement. He also noted that Russia is preparing to focus its invasion in the Donbas region in eastern Ukraine but affirmed the U.S. would continue to ""provide Ukraine with the capabilities to defend itself."" ""This new package of assistance will contain many of the highly effective weapons systems we have already provided and new capabilities tailored to the wider assault we expect Russia to launch in eastern Ukraine. These new capabilities include artillery systems, artillery rounds, and armored personnel carriers,"" Biden said. ""I have also approved the transfer of additional helicopters. In addition, we continue to facilitate the transfer of significant capabilities from our Allies and partners around the world,"" Biden added. According to the Pentagon, the list of new military hardware includes 155mm howitzer artillery -- a specific request from Ukraine -- 200 M-113 armored personnel carriers, 100 armored humvees, 300 Switchblade drones, and 11 MI-17 helicopters. The U.S. had given Ukraine five helicopters as part of an earlier shipment. ""And again, the Ukrainians have made it clear that in this fight that's coming, artillery is a critical need -- not just the artillery piece itself, but the rounds that go with it,"" Kirby said following Biden's announcement. ""You can see, there's 40,000 rounds that are going on with this -- and we will be in an iterative conversation with them going forward and if they need additional artillery rounds, clearly the United States will do what we can to fill those needs."" Reiterating the U.S. position not to send U.S. forces to fight in Ukraine, Kirby told reporters, ""There will be no U.S. pilots flying the helicopters into Ukraine."" ""Unmanned coastal defense vessels"" were also included on the lengthy list of equipment, some of which will require specific training. The additional aid comes after Biden called Russia's action's in Ukraine ""genocide"" for the first time and as Zelenskyy warns Putin could use chemical weapons in Ukraine. The U.S. has now given Ukraine nearly $3 billion in security assistance. ABC News' Matt Seyler contributed to this story.",49,,,,13
2022-04-12,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/International/humanitarian-corridors-work-offer-lifeline-besieged-ukrainians/story?id=84011869,How humanitarian corridors work to offer lifeline to besieged Ukrainians,"For tens of thousands of civilians trapped in active combat zones in Ukraine, the establishment of humanitarian corridors could mean the difference between living and dying, experts said. At least nine humanitarian corridors are expected to open in war-torn areas of eastern Ukraine this week to allow civilians to escape heavy fighting, Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said. More than 4,354 people used the opened humanitarian corridors on Monday to evacuate via buses and private cars, according to Vereshchuk. She said the same safe passages will be open on Tuesday. But the designated routes out of besieged towns such as Mariupol in southeast Ukraine and areas of the Donbas in eastern Ukraine can be dangerous if not done with precision and complete transparency, Crystal Wells, a spokesperson for the International Committee of the Red Cross, told ABC News. “We see humanitarian corridors, that we refer to as safe passages, as really a desperate measure in dire times,"" Wells said. Humanitarian corridors are routes for civilians to escape from the most dangerous war zones. The safe passages require Russian and Ukrainian leaders to agree on specific routes and a ceasefire span of time along those thoroughfares to allow civilians a window of opportunity to get out of the crossfire. Safe passageways during wars date back to World War II, when routes were established to transport 10,000 children from Nazi-controlled countries in humanitarian rescues dubbed ""kindertransports."" The Geneva Conventions in 1949 also established rules to ensure civilians had access to humanitarian supplies, including food and medicine, during war. ""It’s important, first of all, to remember that civilians are actually protected under international humanitarian law. Those are the laws that govern armed conflict,"" Wells said. ""And civilians should be protected from hostilities whether they’re in their homes, in a hospital, in a school or in a so-called humanitarian corridor."" But Wells said that some humanitarian routes opened in Ukraine had to quickly be closed or not used at all because hostilities resumed. ""It’s not like all of a sudden a humanitarian corridors comes in and it's a magic wand to ending civilian suffering,"" Wells said. “It's so important that these are agreed on not just in principle but in concrete terms so that it’s not only the people sitting in capital cities who agree. It needs to come down to actionable, concrete, logistical details, and it has to be communicated down the chain of command to the militaries on the ground for these to work safely."" She said if details of a humanitarian corridor, including the precise routes and ceasefire times, are not conveyed to frontline troops, it could create a dangerous -- and deadly -- situation. “It's not just about the safety of our teams, but it's to not also lead people or accompany people into something where they could be in harm's way,"" Wells said. In the absence of humanitarian corridors, Ukrainian civilians have risked their lives trying to flee battle zones on their own. Many have been killed. “What's been happening in cities like Mariupol is that in the absence of these concrete agreements, you have civilians leaving, but they’re doing so in a very ad hoc way. They’re making a life-and-death decision to go, and there’s not a ceasefire agreement in place and there’s not specifics about routes and the times and all of that. So, it’s very risky for people."" Much of the focus for humanitarian agencies in recent days has been on Mariupol, a port city of nearly 400,000 people that has been under siege since the start of the Russian invasion on Feb. 24. Mariupol Mayor Vadym Boychenko told the Associated Press by telephone Monday that the death toll in his city has surpassed 10,000 and could reach double that as attacks continue. Boychenko also alleged Russian forces have brought mobile crematoriums to Mariupol to collect and incinerate civilian bodies in an attempt to cover up evidence of war crimes. Russia has denied committing atrocities in Ukraine and claims it is not targeting civilians. Vereshchuk said in a statement posted on social media Monday that humanitarian evacuation routes were agreed upon for those traveling by private cars from Mariupol. Wells estimated that more than 100,000 civilians remain in Mariupol. ""For us, Mariupol really remains very much a focus and a priority,"" Wells said. ""That’s a city that’s been for weeks now without any humanitarian aid. They’ve been for weeks now without really any proper safe passage for civilians out of the city."" She said ICRC teams have been trying for weeks to deliver humanitarian aid to Mariupol without success. ""We tried again a couple of Fridays ago to access Mariupol, and our teams spent five days and five nights on the road trying to get into the city, and security conditions didn’t allow it,"" Wells said. Wells said the ICRC has successfully used designated safe passages to get civilians out of the hard-hit town of Sumy in northeast Ukraine and between the Russian-controlled city Berdyansk to safety in Zaporizhzhia, a roughly 120-mile journey. She said an unarmed ICRC convoy from Berdyansk to Zaporizhzhia last week included buses and Red Cross land cruisers clearly marked with the agency's emblem at the front and rear of the caravan. Wells said many of the civilians who joined the convoy were fleeing Mariupol. ""We had seven buses with seven volunteer bus drivers, and that would allow about 350 people to board,"" Wells said. ""But then we had private cars starting to join the convoy from Berdyansk all the way to Zaporizhzhia. By the end of that convoy to Zaporizhzhia, they estimated there were about 100 civilian cars, which got us up to about 1,000 people."" Wells said the evacuation from Berdyansk to Zaporizhzhia took two days. She said a similar mission in Mariupol would likely take longer. ""To think of doing it for 100,000 people, we would really need agreements to hold for not just hours, but days,"" Wells said. No matter how much time is granted to the humanitarian corridors, Wells said some civilians are bound to get left behind. ""What about the elderly? What about people with disabilities? Not everyone is able-bodied to get into their own car or board a bus and leave,"" Wells said. ""So, that’s where it’s also important that aid needs to be brought into these places as well and that civilians still have to be protected and respected from hostilities.""",47,,,,15
2022-04-12,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/russia-mask-chemical-weapons-riot-control-agents-pentagon/story?id=84039751,Russia could mask chemical weapons with riot control agents: Pentagon update Day 48,"The Pentagon has been providing daily updates on the U.S. assessment of the Russian invasion of Ukraine and Ukraine's efforts to fight back. Here are highlights of what a senior U.S. defense official told reporters Tuesday on Day 48: Russia could use riot control agents to mask chemical weapons A defense official said the U.S. cannot confirm whether Russia has used any chemical weapons in Mariupol or elsewhere in Ukraine, but the Defense Department has seen evidence Russia could consider disguising use of chemical weapons by making them look like more benign riot-control agents. ""In the past we've had indications that that could be one thing that the Russians look at, is the potential mixing of agents with the with the idea that they could disguise a more serious attack by using the vehicle and the techniques of riot control agents,"" the official said. Pentagon press secretary John Kirby put out a similar statement Monday night addressing social media reports claiming Russia used a chemical weapon in Mariupol. ""These reports, if true, are deeply concerning and reflective of concerns that we have had about Russia's potential to use a variety of riot control agents, including tear gas mixed with chemical agents, in Ukraine."" Kirby, like the official on Tuesday, emphasized the U.S. cannot confirm the allegations. On Tuesday, Kirby told reporters the U.S. is looking into the matter. ""We're obviously taking it seriously and we're monitoring it,"" Kirby said. ""We're trying to do the best we can to figure out what, if anything, happened."" Russian convoy creeping south The Russian convoy approaching Izuim is still roughly 40 miles to the north of the key Ukrainian city, according to the official. ""We do assess that it's moving, but not at breakneck speed,"" the official said. While the Pentagon doesn't have a pristine view of what capabilities make up the convoy, it seems to be support-heavy. ""It includes some command and control elements, some enablers, and we think it's also intended for resupply, perhaps an effort to amend their poor performance in logistics and sustainment in the north,"" the official said. Heavy fighting continues to the south of Izuim, with Russian forces about 12 miles from the city. Mariupol stands While Russian forces have devastated the coastal city of Mariupol with long-range strikes and have cut off essential supplies to the populace, Ukrainians continue to defend it. ""You've seen the devastation that Russian airstrikes have wrought on Mariupol in the city, but our assessment is that the Ukrainians are are still fighting for it,"" Kirby said. Mariupol is strategically important for both the Ukrainians and Russians. ""It's obvious that the Russians want Mariupol because of its strategic location there at the south of that Donbas area and right on the Sea of Azov,"" Kirby said. ""It's a major, important city... it would provide them unfettered and unhindered land access between the Donbas and Crimea."" Meanwhile, Ukraine has its own clear incentives to keep Mariupol. ""It also has great significance to the Ukrainian people because of what it represents to their economic life, because it is their city and it's part of their country,"" Kirby said. ""They haven't given up on it, and we're not giving up on them, either."" Military aid for Ukraine The $800 million military aid package for Ukraine authorized by President Joe Biden last month has mostly been delivered, and will be completed in the coming days, according to the official. ""Yesterday, two U.S. flights arrived in the region with everything from small-arms ammunition, machine guns, body armor, grenades and other explosives,"" the official said. So far, the U.S. has sent 19 out of an expected 20 flights needed to deliver the $800 million package. While U.S. officials have said Russia has not hit support shipments coming over the border, there is an effort more broadly to disrupt Ukrainian forces' ability to resupply themselves. ""They certainly have shown an interest in trying to hit logistics and sustainment for the Ukrainians, and they have certainly tried to go after Ukrainian air defense as well,"" the official said.",7,,,,14
2022-04-11,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/russian-commander-depravity-brutality-pentagon-update-day-47/story?id=84018303,"New Russian commander, same 'depravity and brutality': Pentagon update Day 47","The Pentagon has been providing daily updates on the U.S. assessment of the Russian invasion of Ukraine and Ukraine's efforts to resist. Here are highlights of what a senior U.S. defense official told reporters Monday on Day 47: Russia's new invasion commander The U.S. assesses that Putin has appointed Gen. Alexander Dvornikov to lead the invasion effort. But the change in leadership can't erase the logistical and operational problems that have plagued Russian forces, according to the senior U.S. defense official. ""They have high challenges to surmount, and the choice of a general doesn't mean that they're poised for greater success,"" the official said. Dvornikov previously led Russian forces in the south of Ukraine. ""He was the commander of the southern military district. And in the early days and weeks of the conflict, the Russians did achieve more success in the south than they achieved certainly in the north. I have no idea that was a factor in his selection,"" the official said. The official noted that Russian efforts in the south are now largely stalled, with no progress against Mariupol since last week, and no success advancing on Mykolayiv. ""If Mr. Putin's decision to pick Dvornikov was because he had some success, it wasn't that much,"" the official said. New commander, same 'depravity and brutality' The official said it is unclear how Dvornikov's selection could affect the fighting, but said a pattern of brutality remains a constant. ""What is clear is that the Russians continue to sink to new lows of depravity and brutality, as we saw with the missile strike on the train station last week,"" the official said. The death and destruction in Mariupol is also a concern. ""We're all bracing for when the rest of the world gets to see what happens in Mariupol, what has happened. I think we're certainly bracing ourselves here for some for some potentially really, really horrible outcomes,"" the official said. Russians moving troops and supplies toward Donbas Some of the Russian units that withdrew from the northern Ukraine area are starting to move east toward the Russian cities of Belgorod and Valuyki. A long convoy of Russian vehicles is beginning to head south to Donbas from that area. ""We believe that this line of vehicles that we talked about that are north of Izium came out of the Belgorod/Valuyki region, from there to the south,"" the official said. Last week, the official said the Pentagon assessed Russia would use that region to refit and resupply its battalion tactical groups (BTGs) that have been worn down by hard fighting near Kyiv and other areas of Ukraine. Some Russian units are too gutted to fight. ""At least in the grouping that we're aware of, it's not an insignificant number of their BTGs are combat ineffective. And what does that mean? It means a lot of things. It can mean that they don't have the manpower that they need to effectively conduct a mission, or it could be ammunition and supply. It could be vehicles, depending on what the BTG does -- not all of them are just infantry,"" the official said. The Pentagon believes the convoy is still north of Izyim and is an effort to reenforce and resupply their forces in Donbas with command and control elements, armored vehicles, and possibly helicopter and infantry support. Artillery is also a part of the reinforcement effort. ""We've seen evidence that the Russians are beginning to reinforce some of their positions southwest of Donetsk. They're doing that largely with artillery units,"" the official said. Military aid flowing to Ukraine by air and land Eight to 10 flights per day are bringing military supplies into the region, and ""near constant convoys on the ground"" are flowing materiel into Ukraine, the official said. U.S. intelligence assisting Ukraine In addition to providing support in the form of missiles, drones and small arms, the U.S. is also giving intel to assist Ukraine in the fight. ""We are providing good intelligence to the Ukrainians to help them with their self-defense,"" the official said. No evidence Russia took out Slovakian S-300 system in Ukraine While the Pentagon assesses Russia damaged airport infrastructure with an airstrike Sunday, there is no indication that any S-300 surface-to-air systems were destroyed, as Russia has claimed. ""We have no evidence to conclude that they destroyed an S-300 system and we have no evidence to conclude that it was in fact the Slovakian one,"" the official said. Slovakia recently gave its sole S-300 battery to Ukraine. US considering training more Ukrainians on new weapons A small group of Ukrainian troops in the U.S. for planned military training in the U.S. when Russia invaded their country just returned home Sunday. The Pentagon took advantage of their presence to train them on the explosive Switchblade drones the U.S. is sending to aid Ukraine. The official on Monday said the U.S. is looking into training more Ukrainians, possibly in the States. ""It kind of follows that the Ukrainians are busy right now and that they obviously will want as many hands on deck there ... to fight this war. But there's been no policy decision that I'm aware of that would prevent them from coming to the United States,"" the official said. But the Pentagon is considering several possibilities. ""As for additional training on systems like the Switchblade, we are reviewing and thinking about and considering a number of different options for how we could manage to get more Ukrainians trained on that system,"" the official said. ""It's a small number of systems as you know, but it's a new system that they're not familiar with.""",7,,,,14
2022-04-11,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/International/ukraine-preparing-attack-east-russian-forces-zelenskyy/story?id=84008413,"Ukraine is 'preparing' for attack in the east by Russian forces, Zelenskyy says","LONDON -- Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy warned that an attack from Russian forces in the east is looming. But he said Ukrainian troops are ready. ""Russian troops will move to even larger operations in the east of our state. They can use even more missiles against us, even more air bombs,"" Zelenskyy said in a televised address late Sunday. ""But we are preparing for their actions. We will respond. We will be even more active in providing Ukraine with weapons. We will be more active in the international arena. We will be even more active in the information field."" After Russian forces invaded Ukraine from the north, east and south on Feb. 24, they quickly reached the outskirts of Kyiv, but ultimately failed to seize the Ukrainian capital and other major cities in the north. Russian forces were met with strong resistance from Ukrainian troops, despite weeks of relentless bombardment that decimated entire neighborhoods and claimed civilian lives. The Russian military announced on March 29 it would scale down activities in the north around Kyiv and Chernihiv and instead focus its efforts on the ""liberation"" of the contested Donbas region in the east, which is home to a mostly Russian-speaking population. Russia-backed separatist forces have controlled two breakaway republics of eastern Ukraine's Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts in Donbas since 2014, following Russia's annexation of Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula. The Russian troops that have retreated from northern and northeastern Ukraine in recent days are now resting and resupplying in neighboring Belarus and Russia, according to observers, who noted it could take weeks before those troops are redployed for a fresh attack in the east. ""At least some of these forces will be transferred to East Ukraine to fight in the Donbas,"" the U.K. Ministry of Defense said in an intelligence update on April 8. ""Many of these forces will require significant replenishment before being ready to deploy further east with any mass redeployment from the north likely to take at least a week minimum."" Nevertheless, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg warned that ""this is a crucial phase of the war."" ""In the coming weeks, we expect a further Russian push in eastern and southern Ukraine to try to take the entire Donbas and to create a land bridge to occupied Crimea,"" Stoltenberg said at a press conference on April 5. Satellite images collected on April 8 by Maxar Technologies show a large military convoy of hundreds of vehicles, including tanks, that extends for at least 8 miles, moving south through the eastern Ukrainian town of Velykyi Burluk, about 55 miles east of Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, and some 65 miles from the border with Russia. Ukrainian authorities have warned citizens in the east that this is their last chance to flee, as Russian forces are expected to push south from Kharkiv and north from Donetsk in an attempt to encircle the battle-hardened Ukrainain troops in Donbas. In an interview with The Associated Press published Saturday, Zelenskyy said his country holds a strong position in the east and at the negotiation table because it maintains control of the southeastern port city of Mariupol, which has been under Russian bombardment for more than a month. Although Russian forces have failed to capture the strategic port to secure a coastal corridor to Crimea, artillery and air raids have largely reduced Mariupol to rubble and killed thousands of residents, according to local officials. ""Mariupol is the heart of this war today,"" Zelenskyy told the AP. ""The stronger our position in Mariupol, the stronger our position in the east of the country."" In his address on Sunday night, Zelenskyy said this coming ""week will be no less important than"" the previous ones. ""It will be just as tense and even more responsible. Russia will be even more afraid. Afraid to lose,"" he said. ""I will continue to address the parliaments and nations of the world. We will meet our partners, leaders of other states in Kyiv and other Ukrainian cities. We will attract even more funds and resources to help Ukraine.",7,,,,11

Here are highlights of what a senior U.S. defense official told reporters Friday on Day 44: U.S. sending Patriot system to backfill Slovakia After repeated pleas from Ukraine for help defending itself against Russian air strikes, Slovakia is sending its sole S-300 surface-to-air missile system to Ukraine, it announced Friday, and at the same time, the U.S. announced it is moving one of its Patriot missile batteries to Slovakia to replace it. ""At my direction, and at the invitation of Slovakia, U.S. European Command will reposition one Patriot missile system, manned by U.S. service members, to Slovakia,"" Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said in a statement Friday. ""Their deployment length has not yet been fixed, as we continue to consult with the Slovakian government about more permanent air defense solutions."" There has been talk of such an arrangement since last month when Slovakian defense minister Jaroslav Nad’ said his country was ready to deliver its Soviet-era S-300 to Ukraine on condition Slovakia's air-defense capability be immediately backfilled. ""Should there be situation that we have a proper replacement or that we have a capability guaranteed for a certain period of time, then we will be willing to discuss the future of S-300 system,"" Slovakia's Prime Minister Eduard Heger said in a joint press conference with Austin on March 17. A U.S. military Patriot battery based in Germany was pre-positioned in Poland for this purpose, and that system will soon be moving to from Poland to Slovakia to replace its S-300, according to a senior U.S. defense official. The Slovak military has previously said it had about 45 missiles for its S-300 system. US 'not buying' Russia's denial of hitting railway station The Pentagon is ""not buying"" Russia's denial of responsibility, a senior U.S. defense official said. ""They originally claimed a successful strike and then only retracted it when there were reports of civilian casualties,"" the official said. ""It's our full expectation that this was a Russian strike -- we believe they used a short range ballistic missile, an SS-21."" Why might the Russians have targeted it? The official said the station is a major rail hub in a ""very strategic location,"" just south of the key city of Izyum. ""And we've been talking now for days and days about how Izyum was so important to them because it lies almost in the middle of the Donbas,"" the official said. Russian units 'eradicated' Some of the Russian battalion tactical groups (BTGs) that have withdrawn back across the Belarusian and Russian borders have been essentially gutted from hard fighting in Ukraine, according to the senior defense official. ""We've seen indications of some units that are literally, for all intents and purposes, eradicated. There's just nothing left of the BTG except a handful of troops and maybe a small number of vehicles,"" the official said. In terms of total losses -- counting troops, tanks, aircraft and missile inventory – Russia has lost between 15-20% of the combat power it originally had arrayed against Ukraine since the beginning of the invasion, according to the official. Russia hoping to recruit 60,000 new troops Some of the Russian forces withdrawn from around Kyiv and elsewhere are now heading to the Russian cities of Belgorod and Valuyki, to the northwest of Donbas. But there are ""no indications"" that fresh troops are waiting there to join them. For now, degraded Russian BTGs, usually made up of roughly 800-1,000 troops, are ""exploring the option of"" consolidating, banding together remaining forces and supplies to form new units. ""It's really going to depend on the unit and how ready they are to get back into the fight, but we don't believe that in general this is going to be a speedy process for them given the kinds of casualties they've taken and the kind of damage that they've sustained to their to their units' readiness,"" the official said. Russia is also aiming to recruit upwards of 60,000 new troops, according to the official. ""They hope to get reinforced by new conscripts -- there's a whole new conscription schedule coming up here in May,"" the official said, adding that Russian conscripts serve for one year. ""It remains to be seen how successful they'll be on this, and where those reinforcements would go, how much training they would get,"" the official said. Additionally, the U.S. sees indications Russia has begun mobilizing reservists. After Russian BTGs rebuild, ""the most likely course of action would be for them to move immediately south right into the Donbas,"" the official said. The Pentagon estimates more than 40 Russian BTGs are already positioned in or near the Donbas region. The estimate was ""more than 30"" on Wednesday, meaning up to 10,000 more troops have arrived in recent days. ABC News' Luis Martinez contributed to this report.",7,,,,14
2022-04-07,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/International/amnesty-international-russian-forces-executed-civilians-ukraine/story?id=83927829,"Russian forces executed civilians in Ukraine, Amnesty International says","Russian forces have executed civilians in Ukraine in apparent war crimes, Amnesty International said Thursday. The London-based international human rights group published new testimony after conducting on-the-ground research in areas around Ukraine's capital amid Russia's invasion. Its report adds to a growing body of evidence that Russian troops have committed war crimes amid Russian President Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine -- a charge that U.S. and Ukrainian officials have repeatedly made, but that the Kremlin vehemently denies. Amnesty International said its crisis response investigators interviewed more than 20 people from villages and towns near Kyiv, many of whom claimed to have witnessed or have had direct knowledge of Russian soldiers committing horrific acts of violence against unarmed civilians across the region. ""In recent weeks, we have gathered evidence that Russian forces have committed extrajudicial executions and other unlawful killings, which must be investigated as likely war crimes,"" Amnesty International Secretary-General Agnes Callamard said in a statement Thursday. ""Testimonies show that unarmed civilians in Ukraine are being killed in their homes and streets in acts of unspeakable cruelty and shocking brutality."" The organization noted that deliberate killings of civilians, rape and torture, as well as inhumane treatment of prisoners of war, are human rights violations and war crimes, and that those who commit them should be held criminally responsible along with any superiors who knew or had reason to know about such atrocities but did not attempt to stop or punish the perpetrators. The International Criminal Court, a United Nations Human Rights Council commission of inquiry and Ukraine's prosecutor general have all opened investigations into possible war crimes by Russian forces. But the interviews conducted by Amnesty International and published Thursday provide a harrowing window into these kinds of attacks with grisly detail. According to the report, one of the interviewees -- 18-year-old Kateryna Tkachova -- told Amnesty International that she was at home with her parents in the village of Vorzel, northwest of Kyiv, on March 3 when several tanks painted with the letter ""Z,"" which Russian forces have used to mark their vehicles during the invasion of Ukraine, rolled down their street. Tkachova said her mother and father, who were unarmed and dressed in civilian clothing, left the basement where they were hiding to go into the street, after telling her to stay put. Tkachova said she then heard gunshots. ""Once the tanks had passed by, I jumped over the fence to the neighbor's house. I wanted to check if they're alive,"" Tkachova told Amnesty International. ""I looked over the fence and saw my mother lying on her back on one side of the road, and my father was face down on the other side of the street. I saw large holes in his coat. The next day I went to them. My father had six large holes in his back, my mother had a smaller hole in her chest."" Seven days later, an unnamed volunteer assisting with evacuations from the areas around Kyiv helped Tkachova leave Vorzel. The volunteer told Amnesty International that he had seen the bodies of Tkachova's parents lying in the street near her house, according to the report. Amnesty International said it has also verified video showing the volunteer and Tkachova writing her parents' names, dates of birth and dates of death on a piece of cardboard before placing it beside their bodies, which were covered with blankets. An unnamed 46-year-old woman told Amnesty International that Russian troops entered her village of Bohdanivka, southeast of Kyiv, on March 7 or 8. On the night of March 9, the woman said she heard gunshots through the downstairs windows of her home, where she lived with her husband, 10-year-old daughter and 81-year-old mother-in-law. She told Amnesty International that she and her husband shouted that they were civilians and that they were unarmed. When they came downstairs, two Russian soldiers pushed them and their daughter into the boiler room. ""They forced us in and slammed the door,"" she told Amnesty International. ""After just a minute they opened the door, they asked my husband if he had cigarettes. He said no, he hadn't smoked for a couple of weeks. They shot him in his right arm. The other said, 'Finish him,' and they shot him in the head."" ""He didn't die right away. From 9.30 p.m. to 4 a.m. he was still breathing, though he wasn't conscious,"" she added, according to Amnesty International. ""Blood was flowing out of him. When he took his last breath, I turned to my daughter and said, 'It seems daddy has died.'"" A neighbor told Amnesty International that they witnessed Russian soldiers breaking into the woman's house that night and also confirmed seeing her husband's body slumped in the corner of the boiler room. The woman and her child escaped from Bohdanivka later that day. The woman's mother-in-law, who has limited mobility, was left behind, according to Amnesty International. Another woman, from an unidentified village east of Kyiv, told Amnesty International that two Russian soldiers entered her house on March 9, killed her husband and then repeatedly raped her at gunpoint while her young son hid nearby in the boiler room, according to the report. The unnamed woman managed to escape from the village with her son and they fled to Ukrainian-controlled territory. ""The intentional killing of civilians is a human rights violation and a war crime,"" Callamard said. ""These deaths must be thoroughly investigated, and those responsible must be prosecuted, including up the chain of command."" Interviewees also told Amnesty International they had lost access to electricity, water and gas in the early days of the Russian invasion and that there was very limited access to food. There was poor cellphone service in the region, and some interviewees said Russian soldiers had confiscated or destroyed mobile phones whenever they saw residents carrying them, or threatened them with violence for having one. Amnesty International found that threats of violence and intimidation were also widespread. One man in Hostomel, a town northwest of Kyiv, reported seeing an entire dormitory of people who were sheltering from shelling and were forced to go outside, where Russian military officers immediately fired gunshots over their heads, forcing them to drop to the ground. Two men from Bucha, another town northwest of Kyiv, also said snipers regularly shot at them when they went to salvage food from a destroyed grocery store near their home, according to Amnesty International. Russian forces invaded neighboring Ukraine on Feb. 24, seizing territory and shelling entire cities. But they have faced strong resistance from Ukrainian troops, who have retaken some territory in recent days as Russian forces retreated. According to Ukrainian Prosecutor General Iryna Venedyktova, at least 410 civilians have been found dead in recently recaptured towns near Kyiv, particularly in Bucha, which has galvanized global outrage, while graphic evidence of the atrocities has emerged, including eyewitness testimony along with videos and images, Russia has claimed the scenes were ""staged."" Amnesty International said it has obtained evidence that civilians were also killed in indiscriminate attacks in Kharkiv and Sumy Oblasts, documented an airstrike that killed civilians queueing for food in the northern city of Chernihiv, and gathered evidence from civilians living under siege in the battered cities of Kharkiv, Izium and Mariupol. ""As these horrendous accounts of life under Russian occupation continue to emerge,"" Callamard said, ""the victims in Ukraine must know that the international community is determined to secure accountability for their suffering.""",45,,,,7
2022-04-07,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/International/genocide-legal-threshold-crossed-ukraine/story?id=83883901,What is genocide and has the legal threshold been crossed in Ukraine?,"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy accused Russia of committing genocide after he said hundreds of civilians were found dead in the town of Bucha following the Russian military's withdrawal. Ukrainian officials have said more than 400 civilians were killed in Bucha, many with hands tied behind their backs, shot at close range. Russia's defense ministry said in a statement Sunday that all photographs and videos published by the Ukrainian authorities alleging ""crimes"" by Russian troops in Bucha were a ""provocation"" and claimed no resident of Bucha suffered violence at the hands of Russian troops. Russia has claimed all its units withdrew completely from Bucha around March 30. An ABC News analysis of videos and satellite imagery confirms some of the bodies seen lying in the streets of Bucha were there as early as March 19, when the town was still occupied by Russian forces, contradicting Russia's claims that the scene was ""staged"" after its troops left. President Joe Biden called Russian President Vladimir Putin a war criminal and the alleged acts committed by Russian troops ""war crimes,"" but fell short of calling it genocide. Experts say this could, in part, be a political decision. ""To say that a genocide is occurring, is also to say, we can't sit on our hands and do nothing here,"" David Simon, a senior lecturer and the director of the Genocide Studies program at Yale University, told ABC News. The U.S. government also has an internal process for designating whether genocide has occurred. It took the State Department five years to designate that a genocide had occurred in Myanmar, Simon said. This story explains the legal term ""genocide"" in relation to the war in Ukraine. What is genocide? Genocide is defined as an act ""committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group,"" according to the United Nations' Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide. Acts of genocide against members of a group listed in the convention include killings; causing them serious bodily or mental harm; deliberately inflicting life conditions calculated to being about its physical destruction; imposing measures to prevent births; or forcibly transferring children of the group to another group. Genocide is not just any large scale violence, or violence that becomes particularly gruesome or grisly, Simon said. There has to be intent by the perpetrators to destroy the group, he said. Killings are also not the only form of genocide that could have occurred in Ukraine, another expert said. ""Other attempts to diminish the group, by placing them in harsh conditions of life, like if you think about starving a group to death, and you actually think of some cities in Ukraine today, where through bombardment and cutting off the flow of humanitarian aid, people are potentially going to be starving,"" Alex Hinton, the director of the Center for the Study of Genocide and Human Rights and UNESCO Chair on Genocide Prevention, told ABC News. Whether or not these violent acts allegedly committed by Russian forces against civilians are found to be acts of genocide, they are illegal under international law and warrant a response from the international community, Simon said. ""What we're seeing in Ukraine almost certainly involves crimes against humanity, war crimes, and then to less well defined terms, ethnic cleansing and mass atrocities,"" Simon said. Legal threshold for defining genocide The legal definition of genocide does not define a threshold for an amount of violence that has to have happened in order for it to be considered genocide. ""The importance of intent within the definition of genocide means really, that there is no legal threshold. Particularly because the convention says the 'intent destroy in whole or in part',"" Simon said. In practice, though, Simon said the possibility of genocide has usually come up when the number of deaths are in the thousands. As of Wednesday, at least 1,480 civilians have been killed and 2,195 others have been injured in Ukraine since Russian forces invaded on Feb. 24, according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. Consequences for genocide The U.N.'s convention on genocide tells countries to take claims to one of the organs of the United Nations for the further prevention and suppression of acts of genocide. However, with Russia's veto power, it is unlikely the Security Council, the organ primarily responsible for ensuring international peace and security, would be able to take action, Simon said. There are a number of things states or geopolitical actors can do, Hinton said. Organizations, including Human Rights Watch, and government actors are currently on the ground gathering evidence for a possible trial of those who may have committed crimes. An inquiry could also be launched to investigate the alleged war crimes committed. The International Criminal Court has begun active investigations into potential war crimes committed, but Simon said it could take years for this to be litigated. ""In most cases, the ICC is able to act only after a conflict is essentially over,"" Simon said. The ICC's investigation into crimes committed in Myanmar is still primarily in the investigation phase, despite the most intense parts of the violence happening in 2017, Simon said. Investigators will need to prove it was Russia's intent to destroy Ukraine or Ukrainians as a group. This evidence would be any articulation of the idea on social media, public broadcasts, in writing or even private communications, Simon said. But, ""there can be no actual case until those individuals that are under warrant are arrested and brought to the Hague for trial,"" Simon said. Radovan Karadzic, who committed war crimes in the former Yugoslavia during 1992 and 1993, and was convicted in the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia in the Hague, was at large until 2008. ""His trial, which included genocide charges, took place something like a decade and a half after the acts he undertook,"" Simon said. Experts say leaders should act either way This violence could push actors to take a stronger stance against Russia, which could have included military action if Russia wasn't a nuclear power, Simon said. Biden has repeatedly said American troops will not join the war in Ukraine, warning that going head-to-head would lead to 'World War III.' Biden has also denied requests from Zelenskyy for a no-fly zone over Ukraine. ""But it may push Europeans to have more of a taste to expand sanctions to include Russian exports of gas and oil, which could be far more devastating to the Russian economy than the sanctions that are in place up to this point,"" Simon said. Hinton agreed that additional sanctions could be imposed, but said lines of diplomacy need to be kept open, Hinton said. ""There has to be a way to get out of the conflict, so diplomacy is absolutely critical,"" Hinton said. Russian and Ukrainian negotiators last held virtual talks on Friday where they discussed the proposed security guarantee treaty. Ukraine proposed a new system of security guarantees similar to NATO's collective defense clause which would legally require ""guarantor countries"" to provide arms and impose a ""no-fly"" zone over Ukraine, in the event of an attack. Simon said the term ""genocide"" can often be used politically, to describe crimes that do not fit its legal definition. ""People tend to use genocide as a label for anything that upsets them. Indeed, the Russians have used Neo-Nazis and genocide against Russians as the pretext for invading in the first place, when there's absolutely no evidence of anything, especially intent to destroy Russians within Ukraine,"" Simon said. Hinton agreed, saying, ""genocide has always from the very beginning, been a sort of political football. It's used and misused by states to serve their interest."" A designation that the crimes committed against Ukrainian civilians amounts to genocide should not make a difference in the response, according to Simon. ""There are clearly violations of international law that are causing great harm to civilian populations. And that alone should should trigger a stronger response,"" he said. ""We have enough evidence of crimes against humanity, that if we think that mass atrocities are a reason for ratcheting up pressure, militarily or otherwise, against the perpetrator force, we have that evidence with us now and we don't need to have a determination of genocide to decide whether or not we find bodies in the street of Bucha repulsive or revolting,"" Simon said.",45,,,,10
2022-04-07,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/International/russia-accused-mobile-crematoriums-incinerate-civilians-mariupol/story?id=83932376,Ukrainian officials accuse Russia of using 'mobile crematoriums' in Mariupol,"In one of the creepiest allegations to emerge from the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the Kremlin is being accused by Ukrainian officials of using ""mobile crematoriums"" to incinerate dead civilians in a deliberate effort to cover-up alleged war crimes in the hard-hit city of Mariupol. Mariupol Mayor Vadym Boychenko made the charge this week, saying he heard eyewitness accounts of Russian soldiers driving around Mariupol with crematoriums on lorries and collecting bodies of civilians while at the same time barring the International Committee of the Red Cross from entering the city with humanitarian aid. ""The world has not seen the scale of the tragedy in Mariupol since the existence of Nazis concentration camps,"" Boychenko said on Tuesday. ""The Russians have turned our entire city into a death camp. Unfortunately, the creepy analogy is getting more and more confirmation."" In a statement released on its Facebook account, the Mariupol City Council said, ""witnesses have seen evidence Russia is operating mobile crematoria in Mariupol, burning the bodies of dead civilians and covering up evidence of war crimes."" The statement added ""this is why Russia is not in a hurry"" to let the ICRC and other human rights watch groups into Mariupol to rescue civilians still trapped there. Boychenko and the city council said the portable human furnaces showed up in Mariupol after reports of alleged atrocities at the hands of Russian troops emerged in Bucha, a suburb of the capital city Kyiv. Ukrainian officials reported that at least 410 civilians were killed in Bucha, including many found with their hands tied behind their backs and shot in the head. Boychenko said his once-thriving port city of 400,000 people has been completely decimated by bombing raids and estimated that around 5,000 people there have been killed. U.S. defense officials told ABC News they have not confirmed the allegations that Russia is using mobile crematoriums to hide evidence of war crimes. Rep. Seth Moulton, D-Massachusetts, told ABC News on Thursday that he is not surprised by the reports. Moulton, a former Marine and a member of the House Armed Services Committee, said that during a 2015 fact-finding mission in Ukraine that he went on with other House members, ""credible sources"" informed him that the Russian Army was using mobile crematoriums on its own soldiers in the Russian occupied Crimea, Ukraine. He said the sources told him Russia was using the devices to cover up the number of its soldiers killed in Crimea. ""We heard this from a variety of sources over there, enough that I was confident in the veracity of the information,"" Moulton said. ""None of that has changed. That is absolutely what was going on back then and I'm now hearing reports, unsurprisingly, that it's happening again."" Moulton said he has no reason to discount reports from Ukrainian officials that Russia is using the incinerators to hide new war crimes. ""The bottom line is this is nothing new for the Russian Army and Vladimir Putin,"" Moulton said. In an interview with Turkish media this week, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy alleged that Russian soldiers were ""cleaning up"" before allowing aid workers into the heavily bombed Mariupol. Pressure has been mounting from the international community to bring war crimes against Putin and other Russian officials. The international criminal court in The Hague has launched an investigation into the atrocities allegedly committed against Ukrainian civilians by Russian troops since the invasion started on Feb. 24. A report released Thursday by Amnesty International claims Russian forces have committed numerous war crimes throughout Ukraine. The organization said its crisis response investigators interviewed more than 20 people from villages and towns near Kyiv and many claimed to have witnessed civilian executions. The United Nations General Assembly on Thursday voted to pass a resolution to suspend Russia from the U.N. Human Rights Council in response to Russian forces' alleged killings of civilians in Ukraine. ""I'm not sure who needs more proof that Russia is committing war crimes,"" Moulton told ABC News. ""They're trying to cover their tracks."" Russia has denied committing atrocities and targeting civilians.",45,,,,10

Here are highlights of what a senior U.S. defense official told reporters Wednesday on Day 42: All Russian troops withdrawn from around Kyiv and Chernihiv The tens of thousands of Russian troops arrayed against Kyiv and Chernihiv have withdrawn north across the borders of Belarus and Russia to consolidate before likely redeploying to eastern Ukraine, according to the senior defense official. ""We are assessing that they have completely withdrawn from Kiev and from Chernihiv,"" the official said. But even with the Russian forces, the territory remains treacherous. ""There are some indications that they left behind mines and things like that, so the Ukrainians are being somewhat careful in some areas north of Kyiv as they begin to clear the ground and clear the territory and re-occupy it,"" the official said. On Monday, the Pentagon estimated that roughly one-third of the Russian forces apparently originally designated to take the capital remained. Before the withdrawal, there were about 20 Russian battalion tactical groups (BTGs) consisting of 800-1,000 troops each in the areas north and northwest of Kyiv, and another 20 BTGs near Chernihiv, according to the official. While the U.S. hasn't yet seen these troops redeploy elsewhere in Ukraine, it's likely to happen soon, according to the official. ""Our assessment is that they won't want to spend too much time on refit and resupply because they have made a very public show of saying that they're going to prioritize their efforts on the Donbas region,"" the official said. But the timing will depend on how much work is needed to get the Russian forces back into fighting condition. ""Some of these units have been much more depleted than others, and it's possible that the Russians could combine units to make new BTGs as a result, we just we just don't know,"" the official said. Of the roughly 130 BTGs Russia dedicated to the invasion, about 80 are still inside Ukraine, according to the official. More than 30 are already in the Donbas region. US sending 'urgent' shipment of anti-tank missiles for fight in Donbas Ukrainian forces are preparing for a major fight in the east as Russia prepares as many as 40 BTGs to join 30 more battalions already in Donbas. ""They're not waiting,"" the official said. ""They are already adapting to increased Russian activity in the Donbas region and doing the best they can."" On Tuesday, the Biden administration authorized a $100 million drawdown package to ""meet an urgent Ukrainian need for additional Javelin anti-armor systems,"" Pentagon press secretary John Kirby said in a statement. The senior U.S. defense official said this move was specifically to help in Donbas. ""One of the reasons why you saw us describe this $100 million drawdown package last night as an urgent need for Javelins was in fact because of the activity in the Donbas and the Ukrainians wanting to make sure that they're ready for increased Russian activity there,"" the official said. Ukrainians get drone training in US A small number of Ukrainians currently in the U.S. for ""professional military education"" were pulled aside for a couple days of training on Switchblade drones, which the U.S. is sending overseas as part of its military aid, according to the official. ""Although it's not a very difficult system to operate, we took advantage of having them in the country to give them some rudimentary training on that,"" the official said. ""And there may be some additional rudimentary training while they're here."" The official said fewer than 12 Ukrainians were given this U.S.-based training. Pentagon blames Russia for nitric acid explosion The official said the Pentagon is ""monitoring"" an apparent nitric acid explosion in the Luhansk region, which Russia blamed on Ukraine. ""We've seen the Russians claim that this was a Ukrainian attack on this. We do not believe that is true,"" the official said. ""We do believe that the Russians are responsible, but exactly what they used when they did it, why they did it, what the damage is, we just don't have that level of detail,"" the official said. 'Premeditated' Russian atrocities in Bucha ""When you see individuals with their hands tied behind their backs and evidence of being shot in the head, that certainly appears to be premeditated,"" the official said, again calling for Russian war crimes in Ukraine to be investigated. Long-range strikes shifting east Russia has now launched more than 1,450 missiles against Ukraine, according to the official. The Pentagon is seeing more airstrikes targeting the east than Kyiv as Russia shifts its overall focus to the Donbas region.",7,,,,14

Buildings are seen burned and completely destroyed, surrounded by rubble left behind by Russian forces that failed to overtake the Ukrainian capital. Widespread destruction was seen in the suburbs surrounding Kyiv, including Bucha, Irpin and Borodyanka. Burned-out cars litter the roadways. ABC News foreign correspondent James Longman, who reported from Borodyanka on Wednesday, described an apartment complex ""cut in half"" and another building that had so much of its exterior blown off that it's possible to ""see right into people's homes."" The town of Borodyanka, about 30 miles northwest of Kyiv, ""is almost destroyed,"" Oleksiy Kuleba, the governor of Kyiv Oblast, said Tuesday after visiting the Borodyanka. After Ukrainian officials began to discover the atrocities committed in Bucha, Ukrainian prosecutor-general Iryna Venediktova said the situation in Borodyanka, about 50 miles northwest of Kyiv, could be worse. ""In fact, the worst situation, when we talk about civilian casualties in Kyiv region, is in Borodyanka,"" Venediktova said Monday on Ukrainian TV. The death toll in Borodyanka and other liberated cities may be even higher than in Bucha, where at least 300 people were killed or tortured, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in an address on Monday. Russian troops occupied Borodyanka even longer than Bucha. ""We are already doing everything possible to identify all the Russian military involved in these crimes as soon as possible -- everything to punish them,"" Zelenskyy said. ""This will be a joint work of our state with the European Union and international institutions, in particular with the International Criminal Court."" Haunting drone video filmed in early March showed the extent of devastation and destruction in residential areas of Borodyanka after strikes from Russian forces began. Humanitarian corridors from Borodyanka had been established as Ukrainian nationalists moved into residential areas of the town, Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov said on March 3. It is unclear how many were able to flee the small town of about 13,000. Zelenskyy began recounting the annihilation of Borodyanka as early as March 5, detailing destroyed schools and the Kharkiv Assumption Cathedral, which had been badly damaged in the air raids. ""Look what Russia has done,"" Zelenskyy said in a March 5 address. ""It did it right in front of your eyes. Protect yourself!""

2022-04-06,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/International/bucha-survivors-recount-senseless-horror-emerge-hiding/story?id=83904795,Bucha survivors recount 'senseless' horror as they emerge from hiding,"As Mykola Pavlyuk stood outside his apartment building in Bucha, tears streamed from his eyes, cutting through the grime on his face. He was desperate to share his story but shook from the trauma of it. Pavlyuk, 53, was one of the surviving residents of the besieged Ukrainian town, northwest of Kyiv, where gruesome evidence of killings and torture has come to light following the withdrawal of Russian forces. He told ABC News that when Russian troops came to his apartment building, they killed all the men who were younger than 50, including two of Pavlyuk's friends. Pavlyuk said he was given 20 minutes to bury them. He showed ABC News the shallow graves he hastily dug in the backyard, each marked with a plank of wood and topped with a religious icon. He wanted to give them whatever dignity he could. ""But it's too shallow,"" Pavlyuk said. ""I just wanted to protect them from the dogs."" Pavlyuk and other residents spoke with ABC News in the days after Russian forces departed Bucha, leaving an apparent trail of death, destruction, terror and trauma that has shaken the international community. Hundreds of people were said to have been killed during the occupation. When ABC News arrived on Tuesday, bodies still lay in the streets. World leaders have called for an investigation into whether war crimes, including genocide, were committed. When Russian troops arrived in Bucha in late February, they asked everyone for documentation and forced the men to strip down naked to reveal any tattoos, according to Pavlyuk. They immediately shot and killed anyone whom they deemed a threat, without asking any questions, he said. The mayor of the nearby village of Motyzhyn, Olga Sukhenko, and her family appear to have met the same fate. ABC News witnessed their lifeless bodies in a wooded area. Another Bucha resident, who declined to give her name, told ABC News her husband was also forced to remove his clothes to show whether he had any tattoos. Russian soldiers took over Pavlyuk's apartment building, turning the homes of Ukrainian families into wartime dormitories for drunk, violent thugs, he said. Rooms that Pavlyuk showed ABC News were strewn with blankets and old food. Pavlyuk said he and his wife lived in the basement for more than month with little food or water, only leaving to cook on a stove outside. He told ABC News they faced the constant fear of an arbitrary killing or a random act of violence, like when a friend was killed by a grenade he said was thrown as a joke by a drunk soldier. The friend's body parts lay outside on the ground for days until Pavlyuk was allowed to gather them, put them in a bag and bury them in a grave next to his two other friends, he said. More bodies were dumped in a mass grave outside a church. Residents had gone out to collect some of the dead from the streets while the town was under Russian occupation. The trench was filled with bodies in black plastic bags that lay on top of other victims, who were either wrapped in sheets or nothing at all. Locals told ABC News there could be as many as 90 people buried there. Russian forces invaded neighboring Ukraine on Feb. 24, seizing territory and bombing entire cities. As the war grinds on, Russia faces strong resistance from Ukraine, whose troops managed to take back some territory in recent days as Russian forces retreated. According to Ukrainian Prosecutor General Iryna Venedyktova, at least 410 civilians have been found dead in Bucha and other recently recaptured towns near Ukraine's capital, where there's an ongoing investigation into possible war crimes committed by Russian forces. Graphic images have emerged from Bucha showing unarmed individuals in civilian clothes who appear to have been executed with their hands or legs bound, sparking outrage from the United States as well as a number of other nations and institutions. Russia has denied responsibility, calling the images ""fake"" and saying all of its units withdrew completely from Bucha around March 30. An ABC News analysis of videos and satellite imagery confirms some of the bodies seen lying in the streets of Bucha were there as early as March 19, when the town was still occupied by Russian forces, contradicting Russia's claims that the scene was ""staged"" after its troops left. While in Bucha, ABC News encountered a Human Rights Watch team gathering evidence of war crimes. ""What we've seen so far and what we've heard from residents -- what we've been documenting -- is really horrific, including reports that Russian forces have pulled people out of their homes, briefly interrogated them and then executed them,"" said Richard Weir, a researcher in the Crisis and Conflict division at Human Rights Watch. A team from the International Committee of the Red Cross was also on scene in Bucha, assessing needs and delivering humanitarian aid. ""Humanitarian situation is dire,"" ICRC spokesperson Alyona Synenko told ABC News. ""We have seen extremely vulnerable people -- elderly, people with limited mobility, people who are sick, who are alone in their unheated apartments with no electricity, with no running water, with medical needs."" Bucha residents Tatyana Chernysh and her husband told ABC News they must have survived ""by God's will"" when so many of their neighbors did not. ""At any time, the occupiers could enter our premises and do with us whatever they wanted,"" said Chernysh's husband, who said he was too frightened to give his first name. ""It was terrifying. It was awful."" The couple didn't leave their house while Russian troops occupied the town. They said ""good people"" brought them food and medicine. Although the Russian soldiers camped away from their home, Chernysh and her husband said they heard unyielding gunfire and that stray bullets pockmarked their house. Since the withdrawal of Russian forces and the recent arrival of aid, Chernysh and her husband have finally come out of hiding to see what remains of their battered town. They recalled seeing bodies strewn across the streets and sidewalks. ""It is obvious their intention was to destroy Ukraine, destroy our people, destroy our economy, destroy our culture,"" Chernysh's husband said of the Russian troops. ""They claimed they came to liberate. They didn't. They are terrorists."" After surviving such ""senseless"" horror, the family said they ""feel safe"" and intend to stay in Bucha, despite a lack of electricity, running water and reliable communication. ""It's where we live. We don't want to yield our homes to occupiers,"" Chernysh's husband said. ""It is our town. It is our home. We are going to stay."" Although he admitted they might think twice if Russian forces return. ""Hopefully they won’t come back,"" he added, ""but with them you can never tell.""",45,,,,7
2022-04-06,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/ag-garland-vows-hold-responsible-atrocities-ukraine-accountable/story?id=83908445,AG Garland vows to hold those responsible for 'atrocities in Ukraine' accountable,"Attorney General Merrick Garland on Wednesday expressed outrage over the ""horrible images"" of killed civilians in Ukraine and said the U.S. is working with international partners to identify those responsible. ""This Department has a long history of helping to hold accountable those who perpetrate war crimes,"" Garland said. ""We have seen the dead bodies of civilians, some with bound hands, scattered in the streets. We have seen the mass graves. We have seen the bombed hospital, theater, and residential apartment buildings. The world sees what is happening in Ukraine. The Justice Department sees what is happening in Ukraine."" Garland said investigators are in the ""collection of evidence"" stage of any war crime prosecution and he is not calling for anything similar to the Nuremberg Trials at this point, but he notably said the Justice Department has a ""long history"" of helping to hold accountable those who perpetrate war crimes. ""One of my predecessors -- Attorney General Robert Jackson -- later served as the chief American prosecutor at the Nuremberg Trials,"" he said. Garland told reporters he personally spoke on Tuesday with the Justice Department's chief prosecutor in Paris who has been meeting with the French war crimes prosecutor. On Monday, Garland said prosecutors from the department's Criminal Division met with prosecutors from Eurojust and EUROPOL to ""work out a plan for gathering evidence with respect to Ukraine."" ""At the same time, the United States is at the request of the Ukrainian prosecutor assisting in the collection of information with respect to the atrocities that took place in Ukraine and that are still taking place,"" Garland said. His remarks come as the Justice Department on Wednesday announced a myriad of actions against Russian oligarchs and Russian darknet operations. DOJ charged Russian oligarch Konstantin Malofeyev with sanctions violations, alleging Malofeyev as one of the main sources of financing for Russians promoting separatism in Crimea, and for providing material support for the so-called Donetsk People’s Republic. These actions are part of the Justice Department's KleptoCapture Task force, established last month and is aimed at seizing Russian oligarch assets. ""After being sanctioned by the United States, Malofeyev attempted to evade the sanctions by using co-conspirators to surreptitiously acquire and run media outlets across Europe,"" Garland told reporters. ""We are also announcing the seizure of millions of dollars from an account at a U.S. financial institution, which the indictment alleges constitutes proceeds traceable to Malofeyev’s sanctions violations."" One of Malofeyev's co-conspirators, according to DOJ, Jack Hanick a former U.S. television producer, was arrested last month in the United Kingdom where he had been living for violating U.S. sanctions stemming from Russia’s 2014 annexation of Crimea. The Justice Department also announced the disruption of a global botnet run by the GRU, which DOJ says the Russians have used similar infrastructure to attack the Ukrainians and were able to shut the system down before it was able to be used against thousands of network devices it had reportedly infected. FBI Director Christopher Wray told reporters the team behind the global botnet was behind some of most infectious cyberattacks in recent memory -- including the cyberattacks against the Winter Olympics in 2018, attacks on Ukrainian power grid in 2015 and the attack on the country of Georgia in 2019. ""We're going to act as soon as we can with whatever partners are best situated to help,"" Wray said. ""The Russian government has show that it has no qualms about conducting this kind of criminal activity and they continue to pose a threat."" Garland echoed Wray's comments, saying, ""We were then able to disable the GRU’s control over those devices before the botnet could be weaponized."" The Justice Department seized a yacht that belongs to Russian oligarch Viktor Vekselberg in Marina Real in the Spanish port of Palma de Mallorca, according to court documents unsealed Monday. In addition to the seizure of Vekselberg's yacht, U.S. authorities also obtained seizure warrants unsealed in Washington, D.C., Monday that target roughly $625,000 associated with sanctioned parties that's being held at nine U.S. financial institutions, the Justice Department said. ""It does not matter how far you sail your yacht. It does not matter how well you conceal your assets. It does not matter how cleverly you write your malware or hide your online activity. The Justice Department will use every available tool to find you, disrupt your plots, and hold you accountable,"" Garland said.",20,,,,18
2022-04-05,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/International/photos-show-devastation-bucha-wake-russian-invasion/story?id=83872938,Photos show devastation in Bucha in wake of Russian invasion,"A man lay sprawled by the roadside in the Ukrainian city of Bucha on Sunday, his hands tied behind his back and a bullet wound to his head, one of hundreds of local residents that officials say have been found dead in the wake of five weeks of Russian occupation. Bucha's deputy mayor, Taras Shapravskyi, said 50 of the dead residents, found after Russian forces withdrew from the city late last week, were the victims of extra-judicial killings carried out by Russian troops, and the officials have accused Moscow of war crimes. Russia's defense ministry said in a statement issued Sunday that all photographs and videos published by the Ukrainian authorities alleging ""crimes"" by Russian troops in Bucha were a ""provocation"" and claimed no resident of Bucha suffered violence at the hands of Russian troops. Reuters was not able to independently verify who was responsible for killing the dead residents. But three bodies seen by Reuters reporters on Sunday -- the corpse with the hands bound and two others that did not have bound hands -- bore bullet shots to the head consistent with what Bucha mayor Anatoliy Fedoruk and his deputy described as executions. In all three cases, there were no signs of any other significant injuries elsewhere in the body. All three people shot in the head were male, and all three were dressed in civilian clothing. On the body of the person whose hands were bound, there were powder burn marks on his lips and face. Such marks can mean a person was shot at close range. The cloth used to bind the man's hands appeared to be a white armband. Russian troops, while they were in Bucha, required that local residents wear the armbands to identify themselves, according to one woman who was still wearing hers. Reuters sent questions to the Kremlin and the Russian defense ministry about the corpses that its reporters had witnessed but received no immediate reply. Russia's defense ministry in its statement Sunday said: ""During the time that Russian armed forces were in control of this settlement, not a single local resident suffered from any violent actions."" It added that before Russian troops withdrew on March 30, they delivered 452 tons of humanitarian aid to civilians around the Kyiv region. Shapravskyi, the deputy mayor, said some 300 people were found dead after the Russian withdrawal. Of these, he said, officials so far have logged 50 as executions carried out by Russian forces. Reuters could not independently verify those figures. The others were either killed in crossfire, or their deaths are so far unexplained. ""Any war has some rules of engagement for civilians. The Russians have demonstrated that they were consciously killing civilians,"" Fedoruk, the mayor, said as he showed Reuters reporters one of the bodies. Reuters also spoke to one local resident who described a person being found dead after Russian troops detained them, and another resident who described two people found dead with single gunshot wounds to the head. Reuters was not able to independently verify the descriptions provided by the residents. Sobbing as she gestured at her husband's shallow grave, a shot of vodka topped with a cracker resting on freshly dug earth, Tetyana Volodymyrivna recounted an ordeal at the hands of Russian troops in this city 23 miles northwest of Kyiv. She said she and her husband, a former Ukrainian marine, were dragged from their apartment when Russian troops set up their command center in their building. The soldiers held them prisoner in the apartment building where they lived. She said the Russians, when they arrived in the city, asked people who they were and demanded to see documents. She said a fighter with the Russian forces who she believed was from Russia's semi-autonomous Chechnya region warned he would ""cut us up."" She did not say how she knew he was Chechen. Reuters sent a request for comment to the office of the leader of Chechnya, Ramzan Kadyrov, a Kremlin loyalist, but received no reply. Tetyana, who identified herself by her first name and patronymic but did not give her family name, was released after being held for four days. Her husband was nowhere to be seen for several days, until she was told about some bodies in a basement stairwell of the building where she and her husband lived. ""I recognized him by his sneakers, his trousers. He looked mutilated, his body was cold,"" she said. ""My neighbor still has a picture of his face. He had been shot in the head, mutilated, tortured."" Reuters reviewed the photograph, which showed that the face and body were badly mutilated. The news agency could not determine if there was a bullet wound. After recovering her husband's body, she and some neighbors buried it in a garden plot near their building, just deep enough ""so dogs wouldn't eat him,"" she said. Another corpse still lay in the stairwell where her husband was found, a Reuters reporter saw. Local residents covered the body with a bedsheet as a mark of dignity. Around the corner, another grave contained the remains of two men, a resident told Reuters. She said the men had been taken away by Russian troops, but she did not witness them being killed. When the bodies were found, both had been shot through the left eye, she said. Six other residents gathered near the grave said her account was correct. One of the residents said she recognized one of the dead men as a tenant in the apartment complex, who she said was a retired member of the Ukrainian military. Bucha was captured in the days immediately after the Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine by Russian forces who swept south, capturing the defunct nuclear reactor at Chernobyl and moving southward toward the capital. Bucha and the northern outskirts of nearby Irpin were the point at which the Russian advance from the northwest was halted after they met with unexpectedly fierce resistance from Ukrainian forces. The area witnessed some of the bloodiest fighting of the battle for the capital, until Russian forces pulled back from north of Kyiv. Moscow said in late March it was regrouping to focus on battles in eastern Ukraine. On Saturday, Ukraine said its forces had retaken all areas around Kyiv and that it now had complete control of the capital region for the first time since the invasion. On Sunday, roads in Bucha were littered with unexploded ordnance. Rockets poked out of the tarmac near burned-out wrecks of tanks. Some residents scrawled ""Beware, mines"" on their walls in chalk after finding booby traps or missiles on their premises. Resident Volodomir Kopachov said Russians troops had set up a rocket system in a vacant lot next to his garden. When a Reuters reporter visited, boxes of ammunition and spent shell casings littered the ground. Kopachov, a Ukrainian dog breeder, was in mourning. He said his 33-year-old daughter, her boyfriend and a friend were shot dead by Russian troops after firing a party streamer toward them just days before the pullback. Kopachov's wife said they fired the streamer as a gesture of defiance, not with the intent of harming the soldiers. ""It is so hard to go through it all,"" said the 69-year-old, as 10 Alabai, a breed of prized Central Asian Shepherd dog, barked in his backyard. Kopachov said he had not ventured beyond the gates of his house for a month. ""They were killing [people] on the spot. No one asked: 'Who you are, why you are out?' The men were simply shot."" The Kremlin denies that it has invaded Ukraine, saying it is carrying out a ""special military operation"" to degrade the Ukrainian armed forces and is targeting military installations rather than carrying out strikes on civilian areas. Speaking in Hostomel, near Bucha, on Sunday, Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov said: ""This is not a special operation, these are not police actions. ... These are inhumans who simply committed crimes against civilians."" Reporting by Simon Gardner for Reuters",45,,,,7
2022-04-04,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/biden-calls-russias-killing-ukrainian-civilians-war-crime/story?id=83865128,Biden calls Russia's killing of Ukrainian civilians a war crime but not genocide,"The killing of Ukrainian civilians committed by Russian forces in Ukraine is a war crime, President Joe Biden said Monday -- repeating his accusation that Russian President Vladimir Putin is a ""war criminal"" who needs to be held ""accountable."" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy accused Russia of ""genocide"" on Sunday after hundreds of Ukrainian civilians were found killed in Bucha, a suburb of the capital Kyiv that was retaken by Ukrainian forces. Some of the civilians were buried in mass graves, others found dead in the street with their hands tied behind their backs. ""These are war crimes, and they will be recognized by the world as genocide. You are here today and can see what happened. We know of thousands of people killed and tortured, with severed limbs, raped women, murdered children. I think it is more than -- this is a genocide,"" Zelenskyy told reporters in Bucha Monday. The U.S. has stopped short of using the term ""genocide"" because of its strict legal definition and the heavy implications it carries. Asked whether the latest reported atrocities are genocide, Biden told reporters, ""No, I think it is a war crime."" He called again for an investigation and trial, even seeming to suggest that Putin himself should face trial himself. ""We have to continue to provide Ukraine with the weapons they need to continue the fight, and we have to gather all the detail so this can be an actual -- have a war crimes trial,"" Biden said. ""This guy is brutal and what's happening with Bucha is outrageous, and everyone's seeing it,"" he added. While stopping short of labeling it ""genocide,"" Biden's call for for a possible war crimes trial raises the pressure on the international community's response to Russia's war, which has killed thousands and displaced more than 10 million people in less than six weeks. Biden said he would seek more sanctions against Putin and his government over the atrocities in Bucha, although it's unclear if more economic pressure will do anything to bring an end to Putin's campaign, even as it has shifted away from the Kyiv area to the south and east. In Bucha and other towns outside Kyiv, the U.S. has also seen ""credible reports of torture, rape, and civilians executed alongside their families,"" according to State Department spokesperson Ned Price -- all of which would be considered war crimes under international law. In southern Ukraine, especially around the besieged city Mariupol, the U.S. is aware of ""reports of tens of thousands abducted or deported by Russia's forces and shocking descriptions of rape, assaults, and murders perpetrated by Russia's forces,"" Price added. The Kremlin has suggested that the scenes out of Bucha, reported publicly by eyewitnesses, reporters, and Ukrainian government officials, were fabricated -- a tactic used repeatedly by Russian officials. Last month, the State Department announced it had made a legal assessment that Russian forces were committing war crimes in Ukraine, including targeting civilians and civilian infrastructure and indiscriminately firing on civilian areas. That assessment was based on public reporting and U.S. intelligence, including intercepted communications between Russian forces, according to U.S. Ambassador-at-Large for Global Criminal Justice Beth Van Schaack. That could implicate Putin himself, according to Van Schaack, who told reporters it depended on what jurisdiction was hearing cases. Her office at the State Department has continued to document and analyze evidence in preparation for trials. But while her office also assists in genocide determinations, U.S. officials have so far avoided using the term. ""We have seen atrocities. We have seen war crimes. We have not yet seen a level of systematic deprivation of life of the Ukrainian people to rise to the level of genocide, but again, that's something we'll continue to monitor,"" Biden's national security adviser Jake Sullivan said Monday. Genocide is an attempt ""to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnic, racial, or religious group,"" according to the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, the 1948 treaty that banned it. It can involve acts of killing or harm, as well as preventing births, forcibly transferring children, or imposing dire conditions that are ""calculated to bring about its physical destruction,"" per the treaty. While Russian forces have targeted Ukrainian civilians, including now with executions, it seems that for U.S. officials, the scale is at this point not large enough to prove an intent to destroy the Ukrainian people. Sullivan used the terms ""mass death"" and ""mass incarceration"" and added that if there is ""a level of atrocity, a level of killing, a level of intentional activity that rises to meet our definition of genocide, we'll call it for what it is."" There are several international investigations underway right now into potential war crimes in Ukraine. The International Criminal Court, which conducts individual prosecutions, launched an investigation in early March, while the United Nations Human Rights Council voted to create a panel of experts to investigate, finally naming its members last week. The U.S. is also supporting a multinational team of independent war crimes investigators, including American experts, that are working with Ukraine's prosecutor-general on her office's probe of Russian war crimes, Price announced. But while the State Department supports those various investigations, its genocide determinations can take years to complete. Last month, Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced he had determined that Myanmar's military had committed genocide against the Rohingya -- nearly five years after the Muslim ethnic minority faced a campaign of terror that killed thousands and displaced nearly one million to neighboring Bangladesh.

2022-04-04,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/sickening-atrocities-bucha-70-russian-troops-kyiv-withdrawn/story?id=83866706,"'Sickening' atrocities in Bucha, nearly 70% of Russian troops near Kyiv have withdrawn: Pentagon update Day 40","The Pentagon has been providing daily updates on the Russian invasion of Ukraine and Ukraine's efforts to resist. Here are highlights of what a senior U.S. defense official told reporters Monday on Day 40: Nearly 70% of Russian troops near Kyiv have withdrawn About two-thirds of the Russian forces that were arrayed against Kyiv have withdrawn toward Belarus, according to the official. This is up from an estimated 20% late last week. Before repositioning, there were close to 20 Russian battalion tactical groups (BTGs) bearing down on Kyiv from the north and northwest, with each group comprised of 700-900 troops. Roughly 13 of those BTGs are now either in Belarus or on their way there, the official said. The Pentagon believes these forces will be resupplied and possibly reinforced in the north before heading back into Ukraine to fight elsewhere. ""Our best assessment -- and it is only an assessment -- is that they will be applied in the eastern part of the country in the Donbas region,"" the official said. During a briefing Monday afternoon, Pentagon press secretary John Kirby said Ukrainian troops are pursuing the Russians as they retreat. ""As they're moving out, Ukrainians are attacking them,"" Kirby said. ""And I'm not a military strategist or a historian, but my understanding of a retreat is that you're moving back as you're getting pushed back, and that's what's happening. So I think that's a very accurate description of what's going on."" The U.S. has also seen some Russian troops leave the Ukrainian city of Sumy to head north to the Russian border, according to the official. Despite these movements, the official said the ""vast majority"" of the more than 125 BTGs that Russia committed to the invasion are still inside Ukraine. 'Sickening' Russian atrocities in Bucha The official said that while the U.S. cannot independently verify Ukrainian claims of Russian atrocities committed against civilians in Bucha, a suburb northwest of Kyiv recently retaken by Ukrainian troops, there is no reason to doubt them. ""It's sickening, it's disgusting,"" the official said, adding that the claims should be included in the growing list of alleged Russian war crimes to be investigated. On Monday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy visited the town, where he accused Russia of genocide. Ukrainian officials have said more than 400 civilians were found dead there, many with hands tied behind their backs, shot at close range. ""We have long said that the Russians would be brutal in their execution of this war. They have been,"" the senior U.S. defense official said. ""We said more than a week ago that we clearly believe the evidence pointed to war crimes by Russian forces. And what we're seeing out of Bucha certainly reinforces those concerns."" Kirby went a step further his briefing. ""It's fairly obvious not just to us but to the world that Russian forces are responsible for the atrocities and Bucha,"" he said. ""Now exactly who, what units, whether they're contractors or Chechens, I don't think we're able to say right now."" Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin ""expressed outrage at the apparent atrocities that were committed by Russian forces in Bucha"" on a call with his Ukrainian counterpart Oleksii Reznikov, according to Kirby. Austin also committed to using ""every tool available"" to help document and share information to help hold responsible parties to account. President Joe Biden put blame on directly on Russian President Vladimir Putin while speaking to reporters Monday. ""You may remember I got criticized for calling Putin a war criminal,"" Biden said. ""Well, the truth of the matter, you saw what happened in Bucha ... he is a war criminal."" Russia shifting airstrikes In addition to moving some of its troops away from the capital, Russia has also refocused its long-range strikes elsewhere, largely in the eastern and southern parts of the country, the official said. ""Clearly they're still hitting Mariupol, but we have not seen the same level of airstrike activity on Kyiv,"" the official said. ""So there's been a declination there over the last few days."" Russia has fired more than 1,400 missiles against Ukraine since the beginning of the invasion. Military aid being rushed into Ukraine The U.S. has continued to rush small arms, anti-tank and aircraft missiles and medical supplies into Ukraine, and has coordinated shipments from a half dozen other donor nations in the last 24 hours, according to the senior defense official. ""Everything we're doing with respect to Ukraine is being expedited -- everything,"" the official said.",7,,,,14
2022-04-01,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/ukrainians-hunting-russians-leave-kyiv-area-pentagon-update/story?id=83799022,Ukrainians hunting Russians as they leave Kyiv area: Pentagon update Day 36,"The Pentagon has been providing daily updates on the Russian invasion of Ukraine and Ukraine's efforts to resist. Here are highlights of what a senior U.S. defense official told reporters Wednesday on Day 36: Russians being hunted as they withdraw from Kyiv area The U.S. continues to see roughly 20% of the Russian forces that were arrayed against Kyiv repositioning away from the capital, the official said. And Ukrainian forces are attacking these troops as they withdraw from the area. ""As these forces begin to reposition, the Ukrainians are moving against them,"" the official said. Most of the Russian forces that are repositioning were located to the north and northwest of Kyiv. Most notably, they seem to have abandoned Hostomel airport, which has been a site of intense fighting at various points since the beginning of the invasion. ""We believe that they have very likely abandoned Hostomel airfield,"" the official said. Although some troops are repositioning, long-range strikes on Kyiv continue. ""Despite the rhetoric of de-escalation, we're still observing artillery fire and airstrikes in and around Kyiv,"" the official said. Shifting focus to Donbas ""This repositioning that they're doing around Kyiv and other places in the north, and this reprioritization on the Donbas, clearly indicates that they know they have failed to take the capital city, that they know they have been under increased pressure elsewhere around the country,"" the official said. While Russia might be dedicating more forces to taking control of the Donbas region, the Ukrainians are primed to make it a tough fight. ""The Ukrainians know the territory very, very well. They have a lot of forces still there, and they're absolutely fighting very hard for that area, as they have over the last eight years,"" the official said. ""So just because they're going to prioritize it and put more force there or more energy there doesn't mean it's going to be easy for them."" Russian ships can hit Donbas While there are still no signs of any imminent amphibious landings, Russia has several ships in the Black Sea and Sea of Azov that could be used to threaten the Donbas region with cruise missiles, the official said. Putin not getting full picture from advisers ""Our assessment is that the planning for this war was done with a very small circle of people, and that Mr. Putin's advisers do not count many. And, you know, our assessment is that they have not been completely honest with him about how it's going,"" the official said. The official said Russian President Vladimir Putin has kept to a ""very, very close circle,"" a leadership style that inherently limits access to information. ""I can't account for the fact that the people advising him have chosen to obstruct certain information or omit certain information. All we can say is we don't believe that he has been getting the full picture,"" the official said.

Kherson contested ""We assess that they're still fighting over Kherson. We know that the Russians are in the city, but we aren't prepared to call it for one side or the other at this point. I mean, it had been in Russian control, but the Ukrainians are attempting to retake Kherson, so it's still being fought over,"" the official said. Bombardment of Mariupol continues ""I don't have an update on the degree to which a cease-fire is being applied in Mariupol. What I try to give you is what we've seen, you know, in the last 24 hours since we last talked, and we have continued to see Mariupol will come under airstrikes,"" the official said.",7,,,,14
2022-04-01,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/US/key-lessons-ukraine-conflict-conventional-warfare/story?id=83746590,Key lessons from the Ukraine conflict about conventional warfare,"More than a month into Russia's invasion, the Ukrainian military has fared better than many expected given its smaller size, budget and number of munitions compared to its adversary. This week, Ukrainian forces reclaimed a town in the northeastern part of the country, while Russian ground forces have stalled around the capital, with some troops moving away from Kyiv and nearby Chernihiv, U.S. officials said. Intelligence experts had initially anticipated that Russia would take Kyiv within days of its attack on Ukraine. ""They failed to take Kyiv, which we believe was a key objective,"" Pentagon spokesman John Kirby told reporters this week. ""Not only do they not manage to take Kyiv, they've not managed to take any population centers and the Ukrainians have been fighting back very hard."" Among the factors shaping the ""David and Goliath"" conflict up to this point has been Ukraine's ""smart tactical use"" of its anti-tank and anti-aircraft weapons, alongside poor planning on the part of Russia, according to retired Gen. Robert Abrams, an ABC News contributor and the former commander of U.S. forces in Korea. ""'They [Russia] have numerical superiority, that's a fact. … They have an enormous missile inventory compared to Ukrainians,"" he said. ""That being said, what we overestimated though, is their ... warfighting competence."" Within days of its invasion, Russia was struggling with fuel and logistics supplies, and verified images and videos of destroyed Russian military vehicles and tanks circulated online. In its latest casualty numbers, Russia’s general staff said late last week that 1,351 Russian soldiers have been killed so far, though NATO last week estimated that between 7,000 and 15,000 had died. The West has worked quickly to send weaponry to Ukraine since the start of the invasion. The U.S. and NATO supplied Ukraine with more than 17,000 anti-tank weapons, including Javelin missiles, in less than a week, the New York Times reported in early March. The U.S. has sent hundreds of millions of dollars worth of military aid into Ukraine, including anti-tank and anti-aircraft weapons such as the Javelin and Stinger systems, which can be fired by just one or two people. Other countries, including Germany and the U.K., have provided similar weapons. The shoulder-mounted Javelin in particular has become a symbol of Ukrainian resistance. Known as a ""fire and forget"" weapon, the Javelin uses an infrared guidance system to travel toward a target, allowing the gunner to fire and then immediately take cover. The missile system can destroy tanks and other armored vehicles. The shoulder-fired Stinger missiles target low-flying aircraft. During a Congressional hearing Tuesday, Gen. Tod Wolters, the top U.S. military commander in Europe, praised Ukraine’s military and their ability to stall Russian military operations throughout the country, especially through the weapons systems being provided by the U.S. military. ""The Ukrainian armed forces show a very, very positive learning curve, and so I'm optimistic about being able to force additional stalling on behalf of the Russians,"" he said. The Javelin and Stinger, which have been used by the U.S. military for over 30 years, are ""very, very effective at what they're intended to do,"" Abrams said. A lone defender could help keep the attacking enemy at bay up to 2 miles away, and aircraft about 6 miles away, he said, showing the power of their range and precision. With enough weapons, ""a defender can keep a much larger enemy force that's mounted in their armored vehicles and trucks, and can keep them at bay because they can't ever get close enough to touch the defenders,"" he said. ""That's really what the advantage is of using these systems."" Anti-tank weapons aren't always a guarantee of success, Abrams said, noting that the attacking force could use a strategy known as combined arms maneuver to defeat them. That might look like firing artillery in advance of armored columns, using smoke -- an obscurant -- to prevent the Ukrainian gunners from seeing the Russian targets and integrating helicopters, he said. To Ukraine's advantage, the Russians are not utilizing this strategy, according to Abrams. ""Frankly, they've made it much, much easier for the Ukrainian defenders with these weapon systems that are getting so much notoriety,"" Abrams said. At the same time, the Ukrainians have carefully chosen where to use these weapons systems ""to maximum advantage"" on their home turf, he said. ""What we're seeing though is such poor tactics by the Russians, it has compounded the effects of the Ukrainian's use of these anti-tank weapons systems,"" Abrams said. The Ukrainians are ""putting up one heck of a fight,"" he added. ""They're utilizing excellent tactics where they are maximizing the effect of their weapons system with the terrain. … I don't want to minimize that. But the Russian army has been equally inept, and it's been a tactical disaster."" Russia's military said last week that it had generally accomplished the ""first stage of the operation"" and reduced the Ukrainian forces ""considerably,"" and would focus on its"" ""top goal"" -- liberating the Donbas region. Russia has claimed to have destroyed thousands of Ukraine's military vehicles, including tanks, and hundreds of aircraft during its so-called military operation. Amid pleas from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy for more weapons, one potential concern is supply. There is not an unlimited supply of anti-tank and anti-aircraft missiles, Abrams said. ""I suspect as the defense industry cranks up production, that there's going to be some supply chain problems,"" he said. ""For Ukraine specifically, they're going to have a supply management challenge, whereby they're going to have to be very smart in how they distribute these key munitions."" Another ""decisive factor"" in Ukraine's war-fighting competence has been training, Abrams said. After Russia invaded Ukraine and annexed Crimea in 2014, military aid from the West has included helping Ukrainian soldiers improve their tactical fighting. ""Russia clearly has the numbers, they have the technological advantage, but we're seeing the value of high-quality training, tough realistic training,"" combined with ""this very precise, exquisite capability for anti-tank and anti-aircraft weapons systems,"" Abrams said. ""They are achieving success and they have denied Russia and their initial objectives in this war."" Ukraine has also begun developing a noncommissioned officer corps -- considered the backbone of the military, who have extensive education and are empowered to lead soldiers, the retired general said. Russia, by contrast, has not made a commitment in noncommissioned officers, and instead is very centralized in who has the authority to give orders and has had several senior Russian army leaders reportedly killed in action, Abrams said. ""We're seeing the benefits of this training, in this professional development, as it plays out on the battlefield,"" Abrams said. ""We're seeing these small groups of Ukrainian soldiers seemingly outnumbered and outgunned achieving amazing success."" ""When you have the power of junior leaders and non-commissioned officers with the right equipment, and they have freedom of action to make decisions to seize the initiative when initiative appears, to take initiative and make those tough decisions without having to call someone -- that is often the difference between victory and defeat on the battlefield,"" he said.

Also, The White House said Russian President Vladimir Putin is being misinformed by his top advisers about military developments in Russia, a development that the Pentagon labeled as ""disconcerting."" ""We have seen over the last 24 hours the repositioning of a small percentage of the troops and the battalion tactical groups that Russia had arrayed against Kyiv,"" Pentagon Press Secretary John Kirby said Wednesday. ""Probably in the neighborhood of 20% of what they had, they are beginning to reposition some of those troops."" Specifically, Kirby said the Russian troops near the Hostomel airport north of the city have been seen moving north towards Belarus. The airport had been the scene of heavy fighting from the opening hours of Russia's invasion. Separately, a senior U.S. defense official said some Russian troops had also been seen moving out of the Chernobyl nuclear facility. However, it remained unclear if they would all be leaving. Some of those troops are being moved into Belarus, said Kirby, who added that none of the units have been seen returning to their home bases. ""If the Russians are serious about de-escalating, because that's their claim here, then they should send them home, but they're not doing that, at least not yet,"" Kirby said. ""That's not what we're seeing."" Kirby said he was intentionally using the term reposition instead of a withdrawal to describe the movement of Russian forces ""because the way it's being spun by the Ministry of Defense is that they're that they're pulling back and they're trying to de-escalate and depressurize the situation and we just don't believe we haven't seen any evidence of that."" Instead, Kirby said the U.S. assesses that the Russians are ""going to refit these troops, resupply them, and then probably employ them elsewhere in Ukraine."" A senior U.S. defense official said U.S. intelligence believes that Russia may intend to shift some of these troops towards the fight in the Donbas region, which would be in line with public statements from Russian officials that they want to make that region a priority of their operations. Even as some of the Russian troops around Kyiv move away, Kirby and the rest have established defensive positions. Kirby noted that Russian forces continue to launch missiles and artillery at the city and surrounding suburbs. Kirby said that without getting into intelligence, the Pentagon concurred with comments in news reports attributed to a U.S. official that Putin is not being fully advised of Russia's performance on the battlefield in Ukraine. ""We would concur with the conclusion that Mr. Putin has not been fully informed by his Ministry of Defense at every turn over the last month,"" Kirby said Wednesday. Kirby described that assessment as ""disconcerting"" and ""an issue of concern."" ""The fact that he may not have all the context, that he may not fully understand the degree to which his forces are failing in Ukraine, that's a little discomforting, to be honest with you,"" Kirby said. ""If he's not fully informed of how poorly he's doing, then how are his negotiators going to come up with an agreement that is enduring? Certainly one that respects Ukrainian sovereignty,"" he added. ""The other thing is you don't know how a leader like that is going to react to getting bad news,"" Kirby said. '",7,,,,14

Instead, it believes the troops might be used in an offensive elsewhere in Ukraine, possibly into the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine. After holding talks with Ukrainian negotiators in Turkey, Russia's defense ministry said it was withdrawing forces from around Kyiv and Chernihiv as ""a good faith"" measure in the talks. However, the move coincided with the Russian military's lack of success in its moves on the two northern cities. ""We're seeing a small number now that appears to be moving away from Kyiv,"" John Kirby, the Pentagon's top spokesman, told reporters Tuesday. ""This on the same day that the Russians say they're withdrawing, but we're not prepared to call this a retreat, or even a withdrawal. What they probably have in mind is a repositioning to prioritize elsewhere."" ""It's certainly not a significant chunk of the multiple battalion tactical groups that Russia has arrayed against Kyiv,"" Kirby said. ""It's not anywhere near a majority of what they have arrayed"" around Ukraine's capital. He noted the Russians have said in recent days that it has made the Donbas area a priority. ""We believe that it is likely more repositioning to be used elsewhere in Ukraine. Where exactly we don't know,"" he said. ""We all should be prepared to watch for a major offensive against other areas of Ukraine. It does not mean that the threat to Kyiv is over. "" Kirby expressed similar skepticism about the Russian announcement from other top Biden administration officials, including President Joe Biden. ""We're not taking anything they say at face value,"" Kirby said. ""We're not we're not prepared to buy the Russian argument that it's a withdrawal. Again, our assessment is that their intention is to reposition forces and bolster their efforts elsewhere."" Though Kirby said Russian troops had repeatedly failed in their military objectives in Ukraine, particularly in taking Kyiv, he declined to characterize the Russian move as a defeat. ""I don't think we're prepared to slap a bumper sticker on this thing right now,"" Kirby said. ""I mean, there are still people dying. There's still bombs falling. There's still missiles flying. And they're still give and take on the battlefield. So I don't think we're ready to call it one way or another here."" Earlier on Tuesday, Gen. Tod Wolters, the top U.S. military commander in Europe, told the Senate Armed Services Committee that Russia's invasion was ""a pivotal moment in Europe with generational implications"" that had strengthened the NATO alliance. Wolters said American troop levels in Europe had risen from 60,000 to 100,000 due to the invasion and said more troops might be needed. ""My suspicion is we're going to still need more,"" Wolters said. ""And obviously, there's always a mix between the requirement of permanent versus rotational and there are pluses and minuses of each one. We'll have to continue to examine the European contributions to make a smart decision about where to go in the future."" During his press conference Tuesday, Kirby announced some Marine forces that had recently participated in NATO's Cold Response exercise in Norway would be redirected to Lithuania and Eastern Europe. The Marine units included a command and control unit being sent to Lithuania along with 10 FA-18 fighters and several C-130 transport planes. Wolters praised Ukraine's military and its ability to stall Russian military operations throughout the country, especially through the weapons systems being provided by the U.S. military. ""I think we can, and we will continue to maintain our support for the Ukrainian Armed Forces,"" Wolters said. ""... We've made dramatic improvements in our information and sharing and intelligence sharing."" That support has included the key delivery of American-made Javelin anti-tank weapons and Stinger anti-aircraft missiles that have helped the Ukrainian military stall the progress of Russian troops throughout Ukraine. Wolters said the supply line of weapons to the Ukrainians had been successful and had not come under attack. ""They've been delivering right to the right location at the right time,"" Wolters said.",7,,,,14

Here are highlights of what a senior U.S. defense official told reporters Friday on Day 33: Ukraine retakes town south of Sumy The U.S. assesses that Ukrainian forces retook the town of Trostyanets, south of Sumy, in northeast Ukraine, from Russian forces. ""They continue to make progress in that regard,"" said the official, who could not confirm reports of other areas having been retaken by the Ukrainians as was reported by Ukraine this weekend. The official added that Russian forces remain around in a defensive posture, ""and the Ukrainians are continuing to try to take back ground,"" which they've seen in the south and north. Last Friday, the official said Russian troops north of Kyiv had moved into defensive positions around the city and were putting a priority on operations in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine. The official said Monday that Russian troops around Kyiv have stopped making advances towards the city, though they continue using long-range fires. Russian troops remain 15-20 miles north/northwest of the city and about 35 miles east. Russia has now fired more than 1,370 missiles into Ukraine. ""Static situation on the ground there, except for the fact that we continue to see Ukrainians defend the city and try to to push Russians back as well,"" said the official. The southern strategic city of Kherson remains ""contested territory,"" said the official. On Friday, the official said Kherson, which was seized by Russia early in the fighting, was no longer under full control of Russian forces. Russia prioritizing the Donbas, but US not sure why The official said Russian forces appear to have prioritized operations in eastern Ukraine. The official described Russian forces moving southeast from Izyum as making ""incremental progress"" towards Donbas. ""We're not exactly sure what's behind this reprioritization. All I can tell you is what we're seeing,"" said the official. The U.S. believes it could be to attempt to cut off Ukrainian troops in the east from the rest of the country, to gain leverage for future peace talks or to refocus their strategic goals. Heavy fighting and shelling continues in Mariupol ""The Ukrainians are slugging it out in Mariupol and they are keeping the Russians at bay there so far,"" said the official. Russian troops entered the southern port city after pounding with artillery and long-range missiles, apparently destroying entire sections of the city. ""We continue to see Mariupol getting slammed by long-range fires,"" the official said. ""We are certainly aware of reports that inside Mariupol the Ukrainians are not only fighting very, very hard, but that they are experiencing their own challenges because you're surrounded,"" the official added. ""It is under incredible pressure by the Russians, but the Ukrainians continue to defend it."" US troop extensions in eastern Europe? A major decision of last week's NATO leaders summit in Brussels was that the alliance would establish a long-term presence in eastern Europe as a result of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. This includes an additional 6,000 American ground forces moved into eastern Europe to reassure NATO countries that border Russia ahead of that invasion. Now, there are questions about if they will remain there longer than what has been described by the Pentagon as a temporary deployment. The official noted that when Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin ordered additional troops to Europe in recent months, ""We made it clear at the time that they will be there for as long as we believe they were necessary to be there, and the secretary continues to believe that they're necessary."" The official characterized them as temporary deployments and said Austin is constantly discussing U.S. troop posture with Gen. Tod Wolters, the commander of U.S. European Command and the top commander of NATO forces, and Gen. Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. ""Those troops are still there and the secretary assesses that they need to stay there, and so I have no announcements or changes to that posture except for those six Growlers that we talked about this morning and as we as we can talk about, we certainly will,"" said the official. On Monday, the Pentagon announced that six U.S. Navy EA-18 Growler aircraft capable of jamming radars with electronic warfare equipment were being deployed to Germany to reinforce NATO's eastern flank and to deter Russia. ""They are not being deployed to be used against Russian forces in Ukraine,"" Pentagon spokesman John Kirby stressed in making the announcement. ""They are being deployed completely in keeping with our efforts to bolster NATO's deterrence and defense capabilities along that Eastern flank. They are not being sent because of some sort of acute threat that was perceived or some specific incident that happened."" ""This is in order to bolster readiness, enhance NATO's collective defense posture and further increase air integration capabilities with our allied and partner nations,"" Kirby said.",7,,,,14
2022-03-28,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/International/cost-damage-ukraines-infrastructure-amid-russias-invasion/story?id=83719126,What's the cost of damage to Ukraine's infrastructure amid Russia's invasion?,"LONDON -- The cost of direct damage to Ukraine's infrastructure amid Russia's ongoing invasion has reached almost an estimated $63 billion, according to an analysis by the Kyiv School of Economics. Shocking images and videos have emerged in recent weeks showing just some of the devastation across Ukraine since Russian forces attacked on Feb. 24. Where businesses, homes, hospitals, schools and other infrastructure once stood, there are now massive piles of unrecognizable rubble and crumbling shells of concrete. The KSE Institute, an analytical unit of the Kyiv School of Economics in Ukraine's capital, has been collecting and analyzing data from the ""Russia Will Pay"" project, launched in collaboration with the Ukrainian president's office and the Ukrainian Ministry of Economy. Through the resource, Ukrainian citizens, government officials and local authorities can confidentially submit reports on the loss of or damage to physical infrastructure across the country as a result of the war, including roads, residential buildings, businesses and other facilities. Analysts at the KSE Institute then assess those reported damages and estimate the financial value. ""It is aimed at collecting information about all the facilities destroyed as a result of the war that Russia waged against Ukraine,"" the KSE Institute said in a recent statement about the ""Russia Will Pay"" resource. ""The Ukrainian government will use this data as evidence in international courts for Russia to compensate for the intended damages."" The latest analysis shows that, as of March 24, at least 4,431 residential buildings, 92 factories and warehouses, 378 institutions of secondary and higher education, 138 health care institutions, 12 airports, seven thermal power plants and hydroelectric power plants have been damaged, destroyed or seized in Ukraine since the start of the Russian invasion on Feb. 24 -- totaling an estimated $62,889,000. Compared to the previous estimate published on March 17, net growth amounted to $3.5 billion, according to the KSE Institute. Meanwhile, Ukraine's overall economic losses due to the war -- taking into account both direct losses calculated from the project as well as indirect losses, like GDP decline -- range from $543 billion to $600 billion, according to an estimate by the KSE Institute and the Ukrainian Ministry of Economy. Before updating its calculations, the KSE Institute said it received ""detailed data"" from the Ukrainian Ministry of Infrastructure on the destruction of its facilities, which allowed analysts to clarify and, in some cases, reduce the assessment of losses. The KSE Institute said it has improved the methodology of assessing losses from the destruction of residential real estate ""based on the World Bank’s experience in analyzing losses in Syria and Iraq, as well as the recommendations of the leading Ukrainian investment company Dragon Capital."" ""These calculations are based on the analysis of several thousands of public notifications from Ukrainian citizens, the government, local authorities about losses and damages throughout the country, as well as indirect assessment methods such as calculating the estimated area of the war-damaged property in the most affected cities,"" the KSE Institute said. ""These estimates are not exhaustive: information on numerous damages and destruction may be missing due to the inability of citizens, local and state authorities to promptly record the damage in each city and town.""",7,,,,15

Here are highlights of what a senior U.S. defense official told reporters Friday on Day 30: In apparent shift, Russian offensive toward Kyiv stopped, troops now in defensive positions The official described how Russian forces around Kyiv appear to have stopped offensive operations toward the capital city and are moving into defensive positions as they seem to be prioritizing offensive operations in the Donbas, the eastern part of the country. ""It appears that the Russians are at the moment not pursuing a ground offense or ground offensive towards Kiev,"" said the official. They are digging in. They are establishing defensive positions."" However, the official said that the bombardment of the city using long-range weapons is continuing. ""They don't show any signs of being willing to move on Kyiv from the ground,"" said the official. ""And that is in keeping with our assessment of a couple of days ago that they are going to prioritize the eastern part of the country with in terms of ground offense. And that is exactly what we're seeing."" Earlier on Friday, a top Russian general told reporters that Russia's initial military operations had been completed and that operations would now focus ""on the most important thing, the complete liberation of Donbas."" ""They have stopped trying to move forward and what they have started to do is try to defend what they have,"" said the senior U.S. defense official. ""We're seeing the Ukrainians really go now on the offense on them around Kyiv and that includes to the west of it."" The official described heavy fighting in the towns of Bucha and Irpin northwest of Kyiv where he said the Ukrainians are 'trying hard to dislodge the Russians.'"" Russian military now prioritizing operations in Donbas in eastern Ukraine ""They are putting their priorities and their effort in the east of Ukraine and that's where still there remains a lot of heavy fighting,"" said the official. ""We think they are trying to not only secure some sort of more, more substantial gains there as a potential negotiating tactic at the table, but also to cut off Ukrainian forces in the eastern part of the country."" ""They are more focused on the Donbas,"" said the official, describing the easternmost area of the country where Russian-backed separatists have been fighting against Ukraine's military for the past eight years. ""The defensive crouch that they're now taking in Kyiv, we think is consistent with their desire now to be more on the offense and to be more aggressive in the east and Donbas."" And that includes increased air bombardment in the region including in the port city of Mariupol that continues to see what the official described as ""vicious vicious fighting."" Russian forces lose full control of strategic southern city of Kherson In a significant setback, Russian forces have lost full control of the strategic southern city of Kherson according to the official. If the Ukrainians were to retake the city, it would mark the first time that Russian troops will have been pushed out of a major city seized by Russia. ""It doesn't appear to be as solidly in Russian control as it was before,"" said the official. ""The Ukrainians are trying to take Kherson, but we would argue that Kherson is actually contested territory again."" If Ukrainian forces were to retake the port city, it ""would be a significant development, no question about that in terms of the southern part of the war,"" the official said. If that happened Russian troops would be ""sandwiched"" between Ukrainian forces in Mykolaiv to the west and Kherson, the official said. ""That would put them smack in the middle and that would make it very, very difficult for them to make any kind of ground movement on Odessa. If in fact, that was their plan,"" the official said. Russian reinforcements headed to Ukraine from Georgia ""We've seen our first indications that they are trying to send in some reinforcements from Georgia,"" said the official. ""We have seen the movement of some number of troops from Georgia. In recent days, U.S. officials have said that it appeared that Russia was seeking reinforcements for its military operations in Ukraine, but interestingly from outside of Russia. ""We don't have an exact number,"" said the official. ""I couldn't tell you whether it's a whole BTG (battalion tactical group) or how many troops."" Russian troops have been in breakaway Russian areas of Georgia since 2008. Russian missile failure rates between 20% and 60% The senior U.S. defense official did not dispute press reports that Russian missiles are failing to launch between 20% and 60% of the time. ""It's hard for us to assess that perfectly in terms of numbers, but we have seen some failures,"" said the official. ""The ranges I've seen in the press from anywhere from 20 to 60%. I would not push back on that assessment,"" said the official. ""But again, it's a range, and it's very nearly from day to day, but we have seen times ... when our assessment is they have they have experienced a significant amount of failure in their missiles,"" the official added. While the airspace over Ukraine remains contested, the official said that Russian planes are now flying about 300 sorties a day and are continuing to fire a lot of missiles that are causing their supplies to dwindle. ""They still have more than 50% but that's the air launch cruise missiles in particular the thing that they're running the lowest on,"" said the official.

Altogether, DOJ says the hacking campaigns ""targeted thousands of computers, at hundreds of companies and organizations, in approximately 135 countries."" The unsealing of the cases and their detailed hacking schemes, according to the Justice Department, are intended to serve as a warning amid the current tensions with Russia about the ""urgent ongoing need for American businesses to harden their defenses and remain vigilant."" ""The conduct alleged in these charges is the kind of conduct that we are concerned about under the current circumstances and has been addressed by various parts of the federal government,"" a senior FBI official told reporters Thursday. ""These charges show the dark art of the possible when it comes to critical infrastructure."" In the first case (reported earlier on this DL after its unsealing in D.C. district court), the Justice Department unsealed charges from June of last year against Russian government employee Evgeny Gladkikh who, along with unidentified co-conspirators, carried out hacking attacks that caused two separate emergency shutdowns at a foreign energy facility. They later failed when they allegedly sought to carry out a similar attack on a U.S. company that managed similar critical infrastructure entities. In a separate case charged in August of last year, the Justice Department charged three officers in Russia's FSB with carrying out a two-phased campaign to ""target and compromise the computers of hundreds of entities related to the energy sector worldwide."" ""Access to such systems would have provided the Russian government the ability to, among other things, disrupt and damage such computer systems at a future time of its choosing,"" the Justice Department said Thursday. The hacking attempts, according to investigators, were part of Russia's efforts to ""maintain surreptitious, unauthorized and persistent access to the computer networks of companies and organizations in the international energy sector, including oil and gas firms, nuclear power plants, and utility and power transmission companies."" The indictment alleges that in the first phase of the attacks, the FSB officers were able to install malware on ""more than 17,000 unique devices in the United States and abroad, including computer networks used by some power and energy companies. In the second phase, they carried out targeted spearphishing attacks against more than 3300 individuals from more than 500 U.S. and international companies, including U.S. agencies like the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. According to DOJ, they were actually able to successfully compromise servers that hosted websites visited by energy sector engineers -- when engineers visited a compromised website their login credentials would in some cases be secretly captured by the Russian malware. None of the individuals publicly identified by DOJ in the new indictments reside in the U.S., making it unlikely they will face arrest or extradition over the charges.",20,,,,5

The U.S. now assesses that Russian troops that have been stalled 12 to 15 kilometers north of the city are ""digging in"" and establishing defensive positions according to the official. ""They're forcing them into a defensive position"" the official told reporters on Wednesday. ""So it's not that they're not advancing, they're actually not trying to advance right now,"" said the official. ""They're taking more defensive positions."" ""We're starting to see him sort of dig in around Kyiv but really trying to go more on the offense than they have been, more energy applied, in that eastern part of Ukraine"" said the official. Ukrainians pushing back Russian troops in Cherniviv Meanwhile, Ukrainian troops in the city of Chernihiv, northeast of Kyiv, have also succeeded in slightly pushing back some of the Russian forces that have surrounded the city for weeks. The official described Ukrainians forces there as continuing to fight ""very hard"" against Russian forces to keep them out of the city and in some cases Russian troops have been ""ceding ground."" ""They are actually moving in the opposite direction, but not by much,"" the official said of Russian forces around the city. Russian troops now prioritizing operations in eastern Ukraine's Donbass region The official said Russia appears to be ""starting to prioritize"" their operations in the Donbass region of eastern Ukraine, particularly around Luhansk, to cut off Ukraine's military that has been fighting there against Russian separatists for the past eight years. ""We still believe that the Russians are trying to basically cut it off and therefore pin down Ukrainian forces that are that are in the Luhansk, Donetsk area,"" said the official. ""What we're seeing now is indications that the Russians are really starting to prioritize that part of eastern Ukraine,"" said the official. ""We believe that they are now going to start to apply, actually, they have applied a lot more energy in the Luhansk, Donetsk area, particularly around Luhansk. You're seeing them really put more energy and effort into that part of Ukraine."" The official has previously said that it appears that the Russian forces fighting to take over the southern port city of Mariupol so they can then push north into the Donbass to cut off the Ukrainian military. Meanwhile, the fighting in that city remains ""very very contested"" according to the official who also described the fighting there between Russian and Ukrainian troops as being ""hardcore."" The official noted that Russian forces continue to heavily bombard the city with artillery and long range missile fire. Meanwhile, it appears that recent Russian military activity around the western port city of Odessa that led to speculation of an attack on the city may have been a feint intended to ""pin down Ukrainian forces."" ""It's not entirely it's not entirely obvious that they actually will make a move on Odessa,"" said the official. ""So we're just we're just kind of watching that to see to see where it goes."" More US troops going forward to eastern Europe? The official said that Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin is always assessing the U.S. military presence in eastern Europe and has not ""taken off the table"" the possibility ""that he will flow more forces in from the United States or reposition from elsewhere in Europe."" But for now there are no announcements to make said the official who added that it's unclear what the U.S. military posture in eastern Europe will look like going forward. ""Certainly, the security environment in Europe is different now. And it will be different that it will be different no matter what the outcome is of this war,"" said the official. ""I think it's safe to say that the United States as well as other NATO nations will be taken a hard look at what it whether we have the footprint right and whether the posture is appropriate to the new security environment that results from all this,"" the official said. Russia has lots of missiles left to use According to the official, Russia has now launched more than 1,200 missiles into Ukraine, but ""we still assess that they have the vast majority of their of their assembled available inventory of surface to air missiles and cruise missiles available to them."" Though the Russian military has expended a lot of the missile inventory readied for operations in Ukraine the official noted that ""they still have an awful lot left."" The official said that Russia's military is ""running the lowest on our air launched cruise missiles"" but that they still have ""over 50% of what they had assembled prior to the invasion. But they still have a significant number of ground launched cruise missiles, short range ballistic missiles, and medium range ballistic missiles.",7,,,,14
2022-03-23,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/us-formally-accuses-russian-forces-committing-war-crimes/story?id=83627208,US formally accuses Russian forces of committing war crimes in Ukraine,"Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Wednesday announced that the State Department has made a formal assessment that Russian forces have committed war crimes in Ukraine. ""Based on information currently available, the U.S. government assesses that members of Russia's forces have committed war crimes in Ukraine. Our assessment is based on a careful review of available information from public and intelligence sources,"" Blinken said in a statement. The assessment does not come with any new U.S. sanctions, but it backs a global push for accountability for Russia's artillery and airstrikes on civilians and civilian infrastructure. President Joe Biden has said he believes Russian leader Vladimir Putin is a ""war criminal,"" an accusation that the Russian government said threatened diplomatic relations between the two countries, already strained to their breaking point over Putin's war against Ukraine. But whether the war crimes assessment means Putin himself is a war criminal will depend on an individual court of law, according to U.S. Ambassador-at-Large for Global Criminal Justice Beth Van Schaack. ""There are doctrines under international law and domestic law that are able to reach all the way up the chain of command,"" she told reporters Wednesday, but whether that includes the Russian leader ""would depend on a court that has jurisdiction,"" she said. Van Schaack wouldn't say how the U.S. will push for accountability for what it has now deemed war crimes, adding, ""Everything's on the table. We're considering all the various options for accountability."" That includes the International Criminal Court, which has opened an investigation into potential war crimes, and domestic courts, including in neighboring countries who may gain custody of Russian service members or conduct trials in absentia. But the U.S. legal system is ill-equipped to handle cases, Van Schaack said, because the U.S. War Crimes Act limits prosecutions to U.S. citizens who are perpetrators or victims. Congress is considering amending that law, she said. Because the U.S. is not a party to the ICC, she said they have no ""affirmative cooperation duties,"" but left open the possibility for cooperating with it. Russia and Ukraine are also not parties to the ICC, but Ukraine reached an agreement with the court to grant it jurisdiction to investigate potential war crimes dating back to Russia's first invasion in 2014 when it seized the Crimean Peninsula and sparked the separatist war in eastern provinces known as the Donbas. Van Schaack declined to speak to individual attacks that backed up the new U.S. assessment, but she and Blinken pointed to Russia directly targeting sites that were clearly marked for civilian use. ""Russia's forces have destroyed apartment buildings, schools, hospitals, critical infrastructure, civilian vehicles, shopping centers, and ambulances, leaving thousands of innocent civilians killed or wounded. Many of the sites Russia's forces have hit have been clearly identifiable as in-use by civilians,"" Blinken said in his statement. This includes the Mariupol maternity hospital and ""a strike that hit a Mariupol theater, clearly marked with the word 'дети' -- Russian for 'children' -- in huge letters visible from the sky. Putin's forces used these same tactics in Grozny, Chechnya, and Aleppo, Syria, where they intensified their bombardment of cities to break the will of the people,"" Blinken added. Van Schaack said individual Russian service members who conducted these attacks could be prosecuted, but so too could their commanders who were responsible for them and were either complicit in the attacks or even just because they didn't stop their forces from conducting them. The State Department will continue to compile evidence of war crimes and share them with the appropriate bodies, including Ukraine's prosecutor general's office, which has said it's recorded over 2,400 ""crimes of aggression and war crimes"" in the month-long war and identified 127 suspects, prosecutor general Iryna Venediktova told the AFP. That evidence includes not just video, photos, and other publicly available information, but U.S. intelligence, including intercepted communications between Russian service members, according to Van Schaack, who said all of it is being preserved for future trials. ""We don't want to lose that evidence. We don't want that evidence to be tampered with. So it's extremely important that it be collected now and preserved with an eye towards future accountability,"" she told reporters. For weeks, U.S. officials, up to and including Biden, hinted that the U.S. was seeing evidence that Russia was committing war crimes, but deferred to a formal assessment from Van Schack's office, the State Department's office of global criminal justice. Still, Biden told reporters last week he believed Putin is a ""war criminal"" -- a comment that the Russian Foreign Ministry summoned U.S. ambassador John Sullivan over, warning it put U.S.-Russian relations ""on the brink of collapse.""",45,,,,10
2022-03-23,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/ukrainian-forces-offensive-russian-combat-capability-falls-90/story?id=83608057,"Ukrainian forces on offensive, Russian combat capability falls below 90%: Pentagon update","The Pentagon has been providing daily updates on the Russian invasion of Ukraine and Ukraine's efforts to resist. Here are highlights of what a senior U.S. defense official told reporters Tuesday on Day 27: Russian forces estimated below 90% combat capability for first time ""Let me remind, that is of the combat power that they assembled in Belarus, and in the western part of their country prior to the invasion, it is not an assessment of all Russian military power,"" the official said. ""But we assessed it for the first time they may be just a little bit below 90% on that. And no indications, no tangible indications of reinforcements being brought in from elsewhere in the country, no tangible indications of foreign fighters that have flown into the country ... no indications that they've moved in foreign fighters from Syria or elsewhere. ""And on resupply, again, no tangible indications that they are making an effort to resupply from outside the theater there that they're pulling in from elsewhere around the around Russia. But we do continue to see indications that they are having these discussions and that they are making those kinds of plans."" ""It's our assessment that as they look at reinforcements, it's probably the most likely scenario that they would want to pull in from places not inside Russia. I'd remind you that of the battalion tactical groups that Mr. Putin has available to him across Russia, he's used about 75% in this particular operation. So, I think our assumption would be he'd pull from outside the country first, but that's an assumption and I really don't want to get any more detailed than that,"" the official said. On whether troops in Belarus were massing on border with Ukraine, this official said, ""I don't have anything specifically with respect to Belarusian intentions, we're watching this as closely as we can. But nothing specific to report to in terms of Belarusian activity towards moving in."" Forces still stalled outside Kyiv, frostbite now an issue, missiles fired top 1,100 For the most part Russian troops remain stalled around Kyiv at the same distances we've heard for more than a week, the official said. ""We haven't seen any major repositioning by them around Kiev. Again, it's kind of been static 15 kilometers or so to the north, west and 30 kilometers to the to the east. They just haven't. We have not seen a lot of movement on their part."" The logistical and resupply issues continue to plague Russian troops with the official noting that Russia now has concerns about fueling the ships in the Black Sea. In addition to lack of food and equipment Russian troops are now enduring frostbite. ""We've picked up some indications that some of their soldiers are suffering from frostbite because they lack the appropriate cold weather gear for the environment"" said the official who added that some of those soldiers have been taken out of the fight as a result. The number of Russian missiles fired in Ukraine remains above 1,100, the official said. Ukrainian troops on offensive ""We have seen indications that the Ukrainians are going a bit more on the offense now,"" Pentagon press secretary John Kirby said at a briefing later on Thursday. ""They have been defending very smartly, very nimbly, very creatively in places that they believe are the right places to defend and we have seen them now in places particularly in the south, near Khersan, they have tried to regain territory. Again we don't have great fidelity of tactical movements, but we have seen them, make these make these efforts."" He noted how the Ukrainians had said a few days ago that they were planning counterattacks and ""I think we have seen indications that they're that they're moving in that direction."" He said later, ""We do assess it in some places they are they are attempting to take back territory that the Russians have captured or occupied."" Russian siege of Mariupol ""The Ukrainians are fighting very, very hard to keep Mariupol from falling,"" said the official. The official said Ukrainian forces have mounted a strong resistance inside of Mariupol against the ""significant number"" of Russian forces that have made their way into the city including Russian separatist forces from the Donbas. For the most part, the Russian forces now pressing on Mariupol are forces that came south from Donetsk. The significant artillery and long-range bombing of Mariupol continues, but what's news is that the U.S. has observed over the last 24 hours ""that the Russians have likely been firing into the city from the sea from the Sea of Azov"" where the Russians have seven ships. The official said the U.S. assessed that the Russian push toward Mariupol is intended to be the ""southern pole"" of an effort by the Russians to cut off Ukrainian troops in the Donbas. ""So that Ukrainian forces can't ... come to the defense of cities further to the west, including Kyiv. So, Mariupol serves as an anchor for that effort, if you will, on the southern stretch of Ukraine."" ""A lot of significant fighting going on. Ukrainians are not giving up on Mariupol. They're fighting hard to prevent that. I'm sure that they don't need to be reminded about the importance of that city to this entire effort,"" the official said. In the Black Sea, the official said, there was ""no indication that there is an imminent amphibious assaults on or near Odesa and again we did not observe, at least from the navy side, we did not observe showing over the last 24 hours."" The Russians have 21 ships in the Black Sea. Twelve of them are surface combatant ships and nine of them are amphibious ships. Ukraine invasion raises questions about US troops in eastern Europe Kirby acknowledged that Russia's invasion of Ukraine has changed the security situation in Europe and that NATO's meeting this week may need to address new questions such as whether to keep troops in eastern Europe in the long term. ""We've got to think about it in a completely different way, no matter how this all ends up,"" Kirby said. Kirby said he couldn't get ahead of the NATO meeting and President Joe Biden's participation but recalled that during Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin's trip to NATO last week that the alliance was ""taking steps to bolster deterrence and readiness"" in the wake of Russia's invasion, including the formation of new battle groups. ""The degree to which they exist long term is really going to be an alliance decision, not something that the United States will be able to decide unilaterally,"" said Kirby. Noting that the U.S. has boosted its troop levels in Europe from 80,000 to 100,000, Kirby said he couldn't predict the future but ""I can tell you that the secretary wants to preserve his options to a unilaterally be able to continue to bolster the eastern flank."" He added, ""We're not sure where this is going to go but the secretary is convinced that wherever it goes, the security environment on the European continent is now changed. And we've got to think about it in a completely different way, no matter how this all ends up.""",7,,,,14
2022-03-22,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/us-recognizes-myanmars-atrocities-rohingya-genocide/story?id=83582997,US recognizes Myanmar's atrocities against Rohingya as 'genocide',"The U.S. government has determined the attacks by Myanmar's military against the Rohingya, a Muslim ethnic minority, constituted genocide and crimes against humanity, Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced Monday. The legal determination comes nearly five years after the brutal violence killed approximately 9,000 Rohingya and drove nearly 1 million from the Southeast Asian country across the border into Bangladesh, fleeing murder, rape and arson. Despite calls from Congress, human rights advocates, and other bodies to designate the atrocities a genocide, the State Department had held out. But now, with many of the same military leaders that were responsible for the genocide in power as part of a military coup last year, Blinken said recognizing the genocide was a key part of promoting accountability for its victims. ""The day will come when those responsible for these appalling acts will have to answer for them,"" Blinken said firmly during remarks at the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington. The determination is only the eighth such one made by the State Department in the decades since the Holocaust, including in Bosnia and Rwanda, by ISIS and the Chinese government. It doesn't bring with it any automatic punishment. Instead, Blinken vowed to continue efforts toward accountability, including by announcing $1 million in new funding for the United Nations' Independent Investigative Mechanism for Myanmar. U.N. investigators have already found that the military committed ""genocidal acts,"" but the IIMM is collecting evidence for potential future prosecutions of military commanders involved in atrocities, just as investigations continue at the International Criminal Court and elsewhere. The U.N.'s top court, the International Court of Justice, also ruled in January 2020 that Myanmar must ""take all measures within its power"" to prevent the genocide of Rohingya after The Gambia, a small West African country, filed a lawsuit against Myanmar on behalf of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, a coalition of countries with significant Muslim populations. Still, activists and human rights groups say Blinken's historic announcement could help spur action, ahead of the fifth anniversary of the military's deadly campaign this August. ""Rohingya faced genocide, one of the most terrible crimes imaginable, and then faced the international community not even acknowledging it had happened. Today, the U.S. has gone a long way to correcting that,"" said Tun Khin, a Rohingya activist. But Myanmar, still called by its former name, Burma, by the U.S. government, is now led by the military commanders who oversaw and orchestrated the genocide, including Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, the leader who deposed Myanmar's democratically-elected government and its civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi. Myanmar has denied it has committed a genocide, instead calling it a military operation against Islamist extremists. It has rejected the ICJ's findings and refused to cooperate with the ICC probe. The Trump administration stopped short of designating the atrocities a genocide, in part because of concerns that pushing Myanmar's government too strongly would cause a military coup that collapsed the power-sharing civilian-military government. But critics have argued the impunity the military largely faced laid the groundwork for its February 2021 coup, just days after President Joe Biden took office. Trump's first secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, called the attacks ""ethnic cleansing"" and his successor, Mike Pompeo, quietly released a State Department report documenting the atrocities, but declined to speak to its significance. But that report was one ""key"" basis for Blinken's determination, he said Monday. When he took office, he said the department would conduct a new review of the evidence and make a determination. Conducted in 2018, the State Department report documented through interviews with victims of grisly crimes that approximately three-quarters personally witnessed a killing, a majority witnessed sexual violenceand one-fifth witnessed a ""mass casualty event"" in which more than 100 people were killed or injured. Blinken didn't just cite those statistics Monday, he also read the firsthand accounts of some victims, including those documented by the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum's exhibit, ""Burma's Path to Genocide,"" which he toured before his remarks. ""It's painful to even read these accounts, and I ask you -- I ask each and every one of you listening -- put yourself in their place. ... These stories force us to reckon with the immeasurable pain wrought by every heinous abuse. That pain ripples outward -- from the individual victims and survivors to loved ones, to friends, to entire communities,"" he said -- adding a reference to his stepfather Samuel Pisar, a Holocaust survivor and renowned author, who he said ""carried"" that pain ""for the rest of his life."" But despite that pain, Myanmar's military leaders have suffered few consequences for their bloody actions -- not just the genocide, but last year's coup -- according to some activists. Successive rounds of U.S., European Union, British and Canadian sanctions, including on key economic sectors and military-owned enterprises, have not changed their course, especially amid continued support from Russia and China. ""Stronger actions must be followed to punish perpetrators, to protect remaining Rohingya in Myanmar, rebuild our lives,"" Wai Wai Nu, a Rohingya activist, tweeted Monday. Since the coup, the military has widened its attacks on civilians across the country and on other ethnic minority groups, while the same systems of persecution and violence that repressively targeted Rohingya for decades and presaged the genocide remain in place. ""We urge the administration, and the international community, to continue to do more to hold the military junta accountable, redouble efforts to restore democracy and bring about a genuine national reconciliation to Burma,"" said Sen. Bob Menendez, D-N.J., and James Risch, R-Idaho, the chair and ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. But that kind of reconciliation seems increasingly out of reach. Over a year after the coup, the armed forces have killed more than 1,600 people and detained thousands more. An opposition ""National Unity Government"" has received some backing from the U.S., but the country is heading toward a protracted civil war with increasingly dangerous implications for Myanmar and the region, according to some analysts.",45,,,,3
2022-03-22,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/fbi-concerned-russian-cyberattacks-critical-us-infrastructure-wray/story?id=83604956,FBI 'concerned' about Russian cyberattacks on critical US infrastructure: Wray,"FBI Director Christopher Wray said Tuesday the FBI is ""concerned' with the possibility of Russian cyberattacks against critical U.S. infrastructure in the wake of Russia's war with Ukraine. ""The reason we're concerned about it is not just based on our longstanding understanding of how the Russians operate, but it's actually the product of specific investigative work and surveillance work that we've been doing all together,"" Wray told an audience at the Detroit Economic Club. ""Most cyberattacks don't just happen in an instant. There's activity that leads up to it. There's scanning and researching, researching a victim, scanning for vulnerabilities and systems. There's developing access to those systems. So, there's a whole range of preparatory work, which is what we've been seeing,"" he said. It comes as the FBI has seen five U.S. energy companies have their systems scanned, according to a source familiar with the situation, outlined in an agency bulletin first reported by CBS News. ABC News has confirmed the bulletin's contents. ""Today, with the ongoing conflict raging in Ukraine, we're particularly focused on the destructive cyber threat posed by the Russian intel services, and cybercriminal groups they protect and support,"" Wray said in prepared remarks. ""We have cyber personnel working closely with the Ukrainians and our other allies abroad, and with the private sector and our partners here."" On Monday, President Joe Biden urged American businesses to shore up their cyber defenses, saying the threat of a cyberattack on the U.S. has grown now that Russian President Vladimir Putin has his ""back against the wall."" ""I have previously warned about the potential that Russia could conduct malicious cyber activity against the United States, including as a response to the unprecedented economic costs we've imposed on Russia alongside our allies and partners,"" Biden said in a statement. ""It's part of Russia's playbook. Today, my Administration is reiterating those warnings based on evolving intelligence that the Russian Government is exploring options for potential cyberattacks."" Echoing his comments was the deputy national security adviser for Cyber and Emerging Technology Anne Neuburger at Monday's White House press briefing. She did not go into details about what exactly officials are seeing, but stressed to reporters the government has stepped up preparations for a cyber attack. ""Just last week, federal agencies convened in more than 100 companies to share new cybersecurity threat information, in light of this evolving threat intelligence. During those meetings, we shared resources and tools to help companies harden their security. Like advisory sourced from sensitive threat intelligence and hands on support from local FBI field offices, and sister regional offices, including their shields up program,"" Neuberger said. Neuberger said there was not evidence of a specific cyberattack, but ""some preparatory activity"" that prompted the White House to give classified briefings to companies in sectors they thought could be impacted -- without detailing what sectors that included, despite being pressed for more specifics several times during the briefing. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency Director Jenn Easterly both said DHS has resources to combat cyberattacks for private businesses and urged companies to protect themselves. ""Organizations of every size and across every sector should continue enhancing their cybersecurity defenses,"" Mayorkas said. Last week, Mayorkas was asked about the threat of ransomware attacks as the conflict in Ukraine continues. He said in 2021 there was a 300% increase in the number of ransomware attacks from 2020 -- with ransomware losses totally close to $300 million. He urged companies to sure up their cyber defenses, especially while the conflict continues. ""Some of those measures are so simple and accessible. changing one's password making one's password strong multi factor authentication, backing up one system, there are elementary steps that one can take,"" he told reporters Thursday. ""We have been leaning so far forward in communicating with the private sector, which owns the vast majority of critical infrastructure to equip them to prevent a threat from materializing, to respond swiftly and effectively to an attack should it [occur], and to prove resilient in contemporaneous with the Russian attack and the real possibility that Russia might seek to retaliate via a cyber channel."" As a result of major cyber-attacks in 2021, the Biden administration has tightened cyberattack reporting regulations for certain portions of critical infrastructure, such as pipelines and airlines. Industry and experts are taking this warning from the White House seriously. ""While Russia has not yet launched more aggressive or destructive cyber-attacks that have impaired critical infrastructure or deleted sensitive data in Ukraine or elsewhere, the administration's comments suggest recent intelligence indicates Russian cyber operators are conducting digital reconnaissance or electronically probing electronic systems in the United States that could lead to those types of operations,"" Javed Ali, the former senior counterterrorism Director at the National Security Council told ABC News. ""These public statements that seem to give clues about Russian cyber threats and other military developments from different intelligence sources and methods are part of the Biden administration's overall strategy to put pressure on Putin and demonstrate that the United States and its partners have advance notice of Russia's intentions,"" he said. Critical infrastructure companies are monitoring the threat, including the Tennessee Valley Authority, a company that provides electricity for 153 local power companies in Tennessee and surrounding states. ""TVA continually monitors for ever-changing threats to cybersecurity,"" a company spokesperson told ABC News. ""We use a multi-layer security strategy, including a combination of hardware, software and procedural controls, to secure our critical generation, transmission and business infrastructure systems. TVA's cybersecurity team monitors the entire enterprise 24/7 and coordinates with federal security agencies to rapidly implement new protective measures for targeted cybersecurity issues.""",20,,,,5
2022-03-22,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/pentagon-demurs-biden-confirms-russia-fired-hypersonic-missile/story?id=83587994,"After Pentagon demurs, Biden confirms Russia fired hypersonic missile: Ukraine Day 26","The Pentagon has been providing daily updates on the Russian invasion of Ukraine and Ukraine's efforts to resist. Here are highlights of what a senior U.S. defense official told reporters Monday on Day 26: Russia uses hypersonic missile against Ukraine: Biden President Joe Biden confirmed Monday night that Russia has used a hypersonic missile in Ukraine, saying it’s “the only thing that they can get through with absolute certainty.” ""It doesn't make that much difference, except it's almost impossible to stop it. There's a reason they’re using it,"" Biden said at the Business Roundtable’s CEO Quarterly Meeting in Washington, D.C. Earlier on Monday, a senior U.S. defense official could not confirm Russia's claims to have used hypersonic missiles in Ukraine, but said it's not clear why it would. ""It's a bit of a head-scratcher to be honest with you, because it's not exactly clear why, if it's true, would you need a hypersonic missile fired from not that far away to hit a building?"" the official said. One of the major advantages of hypersonic weapons is the ability to evade radar detection from distant targets. But for hitting nearby Ukraine, the advantages are less obvious. One reason Russia might have used such a weapon could be due to running low on precision-guided munitions, or to send a message to the West and Ukraine in order to gain leverage in negotiations, the defense official said, adding that it is not practical from a purely military perspective. No Russian progress on the ground Russian forces are no closer to Kyiv than they were more than a week ago, the official said. ""They haven't achieved anything in terms of what we assessed to be their objectives, which was population centers so that they could occupy and take over Ukraine,"" the official said. The official added that you can count ""on one hand"" the cities Russian forces have taken, noting that Donetsk and Luhansk were already under their control before the invasion. ""So what have they gained in now 26 days? They got Melitopol, they got Berdyansk, and they got Kherson. That's it. They don't have Kharkiv, they don't have Mariupol,"" the official said. Ukrainian forces even mounted a counter-attack to try to retake Kherson, according to the official. ""It's very clear that the Ukrainians are showing no signs of stopping the resistance and no signs of slowing down their attacks on the Russians,"" the official said. The official said most credit for the stalled Russian efforts goes to the Ukrainian forces and citizens, and the leadership of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. ""President Zelenskyy has been quite inspirational, as you've all seen, and has really motivated his forces and his citizens, because some average citizens are picking up arms and fighting,"" the official said. But weapons and training from the U.S. and others are also playing a major role. ""It's not just about pointing and shooting,"" the official said. ""They're able to be nimble and creative because they were so well trained over the last eight years."" Despite setbacks, Russian forces have most of their forces intact and are trying to overcome. ""They are looking for a chance to gain some momentum -- not even regain momentum ... because they never really had it. And that's what's so frustrating for them,"" the official said. The frustrated Russian ground effort is leading to more missile strikes and artillery bombardment on cities, which makes things ever more dangerous for civilians, according to the official. ""This is not a military known for precision,"" the official said of the invaders. Pentagon press secretary John Kirby told reporters Monday the Pentagon believes Russia is in some cases deliberately targeting civilians. “We certainly see clear evidence that Russian forces are committing war crimes,"" Kirby said. ""And we are helping with the collecting of evidence of that. But there's investigative processes that are going to go on and we're gonna let that happen. We're going to contribute to that investigative process.” Failure to launch The U.S. assesses Russia has fired more than 1,100 missiles against Ukraine since the beginning of the invasion. And there are indications it is having ""inventory issues"" with its precision-guided munitions, which could be one reason we're seeing greater use of unguided ""dumb bombs,"" the official said. The official added that Russia still has the majority of its missile stocks available. But the Pentagon is also seeing problems with the reliability of Russia's precision weapons. Some Russian missiles are ""failing to launch, or they're failing to hit the target, or they're failing to explode on contact,"" the official said. More Russian naval action near Odessa While there is still no sign of an imminent amphibious assault, the U.S. has seen more naval activity in the northern Black Sea, where Russia has more than a dozen surface warships of varying types. ""Clearly they're using surface combatants for shelling purposes, and for the long-range fires in and around Odessa,"" the official said. ""Whether this is a prelude to an amphibious assault is not clear."" Russian combat power Russia's invading force has ""just below"" 90% of its combat power intact, according to the official. ""We recognize that they are taking casualties every day. They are losing aircraft, they are losing armor and vehicles -- there's no doubt about that. Tanks, APCs, artillery units, helicopters, fixed wing jets,"" the official said. As for Ukraine, the Pentagon assesses it still has more than 90% of its combat power intact. The official credits this to the constant arms replenishment coming in from the U.S. and others. Also keep in mind that while this estimated percentage is slightly higher for Ukraine than Russia, Russia has more total power to lose. So far, the U.S. hasn't seen any movement of additional Russian troops to Ukraine. Russia lacks small-unit leadership The official could not confirm Ukrainian claims to have killed six Russian generals, but said it makes sense that there would be senior officers on the ground with the invading force. First, this is a major operation for the Russian military Second, ""they don't organize their military the way we do, they don't have an equivalent to a noncommissioned officer corps. And their junior officers don't have the same wherewithal, flexibility -- they don't invest in their junior officers the kind of initiative that we do,"" the official said. While the U.S. military instills a sense of battlefield leadership starting at the junior NCO ranks (corporals and sergeants on up), the Russian military has no such ethos, according to the official. ""The fact that there might be senior leaders on the field perhaps involved at a more tactical level than we would have a two star or a one star, it's apples to oranges in terms of how they organize themselves and how they lead,"" the official said, adding that Russian forces seem to be having command-and-control problems. $800 million weapons package from US shipping soon Initial shipments of the new $800 million U.S. weapons package to Ukraine will arrive ""very, very soon,"" the official said. This package includes thousands of shoulder-fired anti-armor/air systems, small arms, and 100 small Switchblade drone systems. The Pentagon has not seen any attempts by Russia to hit incoming weapon shipments so far. ABC News' Justin Gomez and Luis Martinez contributed to this report.",7,,,,14
2022-03-18,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/International/lviv-ukraine-hit-missiles-1st-time-russian-invasion/story?id=83526019,"Lviv, Ukraine, hit with missiles for 1st time since Russian invasion","Russian missile strikes hit the western Ukrainian city of Lviv Friday around 6:30 a.m. local time, marking the first strike on the city since the invasion began. The missiles hit the area near Lviv's airport, about 4 miles from the city center, according to the mayor of Lviv, Andriy Sadovyi. No casualties were reported after the attack, according to Sadovyi. Lviv is about 50 miles from the border with Poland. An aircraft repair plant was hit and destroyed and windows in the buildings of the communal transport enterprise were damaged in the strike, Sadovyi said. Six missiles, likely X-555, were fired from the Black Sea, according to preliminary data from the Ukraine's western military command. Two of the missiles were destroyed by anti-aircraft missile troops, command said. In an address Friday, Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the country's air force is ""not enough to ensure safety."" ""Russian forces continue to bomb and shell our cities -- from Lviv to Kyiv, from Kharkiv to Chernihiv, Sumy, Zhytomyr, cities of Donbas especially Mariupol. They fire missiles, drop bombs and launch GRADs. We try to intercept and shoot down whatever we can: aircraft, helicopters and missiles although we don't yet possess the adequate anti-missile weapons, modern systems,"" Zelenskyy said. He added that his appeals for weapons will be ""more forceful."" ""We'll remind those leaders that they will suffer moral defeat if they don't provide us with adequate and modern weapons promised to us, weapons that could quite literally save thousands upon thousands of Ukrainian lives. Russian missiles will not be shot down by age-old rifles that certain parties try to supply to us instead of modern equipment,"" Zelenskyy said. A senior U.S. official told ABC News Thursday that Russians have been using more long range systems, mobile systems repositioned from inside Russia to the border, but on the Russian side. There is apparently concern if they move across the border, guerilla fighters will intercept them.",49,,,,13
2022-03-15,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/International/civilians-war-amid-ukraine-conflict/story?id=83178098,What to know about civilians in war amid Ukraine conflict,"In the Ukraine conflict, reports of civilian casualties have dominated the headlines as Russian troops siege cities around the country. Civilian buildings have been hit by Russian forces, with hospitals and residential buildings shelled, causing thousands of civilian casualties and massive human suffering. Russia has denied they are deliberately targeting civilians and insisted in some cases that enemy fighters were hiding within the buildings. Russia is also reported to have used unguided ""dumb"" bombs in Ukraine, which greatly increase the risk of missing targets and hitting civilian infrastructure. Many countries, including the United States, along with independent monitors, like Amnesty International, have condemned Russia's actions. ""We've all seen the devastating images coming out of Ukraine and are appalled by Russia's brutal tactics,"" White House deputy press secretary Andrew Bates said Friday. ""Pregnant women on stretchers, apartment buildings -- buildings shelled, families killed while seeking safety from this terrible violence. These are disgusting attacks; civilian casualties are increasing. If Russia is intentionally targeting civilians, that would be a war crime."" But whether or not these attacks constitute war crimes has been debated. U.S. officials and the United Nations have been more reserved, saying legal assessments must be done, but Ukrainian officials have clearly condemned Russia's attacks as violations of international humanitarian law. Making matters murkier is the issue of civilians taking up arms to resist the Russian advance and the fact that the front lines often disappear in the realm of urban warfare. Here's what you need to know about the laws of war pertaining to civilians: Civilians off limits, except when they take up arms In an armed conflict, countries are not allowed to deliberately target or indiscriminately attack civilians, the civilian population or civilian properties, according to the rules of international humanitarian law, or IHL. IHL covers the rules of war, specifying what parties can and can't do during an armed conflict. The Geneva Conventions, four treaties adopted in 1949 and signed by 196 countries, are the core of IHL, according to the humanitarian organization International Committee of the Red Cross. Additional protocols were later adopted in 1977 and 2005. The conventions and protocols regulate the conduct of armed conflict and seek to minimize its effects. Russia signed Protocol 1 in 1977, but Russian leader Vladimir Putin revoked Russia's acceptance in October 2019, citing potential abuse of a commission set up to investigate war crimes. But the protections for civilians who participate in an armed conflict by taking up arms are different, Allen Weiner, the director of the Stanford Program in International and Comparative Law, told ABC News. ""The rule is that civilians can be targeted, but only for such time as they are directly taking part in hostilities. So while a civilian is shooting at you, they become a permissible target. When they go back home, they cease to be permissible target under the law of armed conflict,"" Weiner said. Principles of distinction, proportionality, precautions Under the Geneva Conventions, signatory states must abide by the IHL principles of distinction, proportionality and precautions during an armed conflict. Distinction requires all sides to distinguish between civilian populations and combatants at all times, including distinguishing between civilian and military infrastructures, according to the ICRC. This distinction is important, as the rules of war forbid countries from launching attacks on civilians and civilian objects or even launching indiscriminate attacks that hit military targets and civilians or civilian objects without distinction. ""Essential infrastructure must be spared, including water, gas and electrical systems that, for instance, provide civilian homes, schools and medical facilities with vital water and electricity supplies,"" the ICRC told ABC News. Russia, for instance, has captured the Chernobyl and Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plants and attacked at least 26 health care facilities, the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, or OHCHR, last week. Russia has also hit other gas and electric infrastructure. ""There's not really different tiers of immunity; civilian objects are immune, period. So a civilian house is immune, a school is immune and a hospital is immune. And there's really only one degree of immunity, which is, it can't be targeted,"" Weiner said. The ICRC said that the use of ""weapons with wide area effects must be avoided in populated areas"" and that ""attacks carried out with new technologies and cyber means must also respect international humanitarian law."" The Russian army has been accused of using cluster bombs by Ukraine, including at Central City Hospital in Vuhledar on Feb. 24, reports the Office of the OHCHR called ""credible."" Proportionality prohibits states from launching attacks against military targets if the attack is expected to cause incidental loss of civilian life, injury to civilians or damage to civilian objects. Attacks may only be launched against a military objective if the potential civilian losses are not expected to outweigh the foreseen military advantage, according to the ICRC. Parties to a conflict must ""at all times take action to minimize civilian harm,"" Cordula Droege, the chief legal officer for the ICRC, told ABC News in an interview. In a conflict, countries are required to take constant precautions to spare civilians and their objects, which includes doing everything possible to verify that targets are military objects and giving advance warning of attacks that may affect the civilian population when possible, according to the ICRC. ""Civilians should be spared,"" Droege said. Consequences There are consequences for breaking the rules of war. War crimes are documented and investigated by governments and international courts, such as the International Criminal Court. Individuals can also be prosecuted for war crimes, according to the ICRC. Russia has been accused of targeting civilians and civilian infrastructures during its invasion of Ukraine, which is considered illegal under international law. Russia has denied the accusations and in some cases claimed enemy fighters were hiding behind civilians and in civilian buildings. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken accused Russia of hitting civilian targets in Ukraine, killing innocent people and destroying hospitals, schools and critical infrastructure such as running water, electricity and gas, all of which is protected under international law. But while the U.S. has said it is documenting the incidents, officials have stopped short of saying Russia is guilty of war crimes. ""States are obligated to prosecute people who commit these crimes. ... If the Russians are doing it, they have a legal obligation to prosecute their own,"" Weiner said. ""A lot of militaries do actually prosecute their own people if they violate the rules."" The ICRC is ""extremely worried about the protection of civilians"" in Ukraine, Droege said. ""We are engaging all parties to the conflict on a bilateral and confidential dialogue to ensure they abide by their [IHL] obligations, including the respect of civilian objects, such as essential infrastructure, and, more broadly, all other IHL rules on the conduct of hostilities,"" the ICRC said. Even though Ukraine did not sign on to be a party to the International Criminal Court, it issued a declaration recognizing the jurisdiction of the court in 2015 -- a year and a half after Russian forces first invaded Ukraine, seizing the Crimean Peninsula and launching a separatist war in the eastern provinces Donetsk and Luhansk. That declaration gives the ICC the ability to prosecute criminal cases in the country, while the Ukrainian government has also said it is collecting evidence to be able to prosecute Russian service members they capture who have violated IHL. Theoretically, Weiner said, there could be a prosecution of Russian soldiers or even Russia civilians in command of the army, such as the head of state or minister of defense, in the case of ""ordering or directing these violations of international humanitarian law."" While Weiner said the evidence gathered will show what, if any, violations of international humanitarian law have occurred, one thing is clear to him. ""This is really unusual in terms of being one of the most flagrant violations that I have seen of the basic idea that one country can't simply invade another and try to take its territory by force, or to replace its government,"" Weiner said.",45,,,,10

She was captured in a powerful photo taken by an Associated Press photographer after a Russian airstrike destroyed the hospital. She was carried out from the rubble of the hospital on a stretcher. In the now internationally known photo, the woman can be seen covered in dust, holding her lower abdomen as she was carried through the wreckage. She died after medics at a nearby hospital attempted to save her and her baby's life. Her name is not yet known, according to the Associated Press, as her body was taken by her husband and father. According to reporter Asya Dolina from Voice of America, AP photographer Evgeny Maloletka, who took the photos of the woman, also confirmed her death. Another pregnant woman evacuated from the wreckage, Marianna Podgurskaya, gave birth to a girl Sunday, Dolina said Ukrainian officials said the attack initially killed at least three people, including a child, and wounded at least 17 people. Mariupol deputy mayor Sergei Orlov said that at least 1,207 people have died in the city because of shelling and aerial attacks since the Russian invasion began. Half of those killed were ethnic Russians. Among the casualties was a child who died from dehydration, according to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Zelenskyy had posted a video on social media last Wednesday, which he said showed the heavily damaged children's hospital and maternity ward in the southeastern Ukrainian port city. ""Direct strike of Russian troops at the maternity hospital,"" he said, calling on the international community again to impose a ""no-fly"" zone over Ukraine. ""People, children are under the wreckage. Atrocity! How much longer will the world be an accomplice ignoring terror?"" The city has been burying its dead in a mass grave on the outskirts of Mariupol as it endures heavy shelling, officials said.

2022-03-14,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/base-russia-struck-poland-funnel-weapons-pentagon-ukraine/story?id=83437698,Base Russia struck near Poland not used to funnel weapons: Pentagon Ukraine updates,"The Pentagon has been providing daily updates on the Russian invasion of Ukraine and Ukraine's efforts to resist. Here are highlights of what a senior U.S. defense official told reporters on Monday: Fallout from deadly airstrike near Polish border On Sunday, Russian long-range bombers launched ""more than a couple dozen"" cruise missiles at a western Ukrainian training facility near Yavoriv, about 10 miles from the Polish border. All of the missiles were launched from Russian airspace, damaging at least seven buildings, according to the official. The attack left at least 35 dead and 134 wounded, according to Ukrainian officials. Russia also hit two airfields in western Ukraine on Friday in the towns of Lutsk and Ivano-Frankovsk. During a Monday press briefing at the Pentagon, press secretary John Kirby said the strikes in western Ukraine are part of a broadening Russian assault across Ukraine. ""I wouldn't think that that we would consider this or the other strikes in western Ukraine as some sort of turning point,"" Kirby said, but adding, ""The Russians clearly are expanding some of their targets sets."" ""If Mr. Putin was trying to signal his displeasure about a strong, united NATO with this war of his then he's failed, because he's getting exactly what he says he doesn't want -- a strong, united NATO on his Western flank,"" Kirby said. While there were 150 Florida National Guardsmen training Ukrainians on part of the base as recently as February, all U.S. troops and contractors were pulled from the country before the beginning of the invasion. The strike occurred after the Kremlin claimed arms shipments to Ukraine are ""legitimate targets,"" but the U.S. official said no security assistance sites were hit in this case. Kirby confirmed the training center was not being used to funnel U.S. weapons to Ukrainian forces. ""I would just tell you that we have multiple routes to get security assistance into the hands of the Ukrainians,"" Kirby said. In total, Russia has now launched more than 900 missiles against Ukraine, according to the senior U.S. defense official. This estimate is up from 810 on Friday. Reports of Russia seeking military supplies from China ""I would just say that we're going to watch that very, very closely. And as others in the administration have said, if China does choose to materially support Russia in this war, there will likely be consequences for China,"" the official said. Cease-fire talks ""We want to see the violence stop,"" the official said. ""All I can do is tell you what we're seeing on the ground, and what we're seeing on the ground is a continued military effort to subdue these population centers and to do it now with ever more violence using more and more long-range fires, which are increasingly indiscriminate in terms of what they're hitting."" Russian advance mostly stalled ""Almost all of Russia's advances remain stalled,"" the official said. Kyiv: The Russians closest to Kyiv are still near Hostomel Airport to the northwest, about 9 miles (15km) from city center. Some troops are moving in behind those advance forces, ""but not at a great pace,"" the official said. The forces approaching from the east are still about 12-19 miles from the heart of Kyiv, according to the official. This was the same estimate given by the official on Friday. ""No real progress to speak to,"" the official said of these forces. They're facing heavy resistance from the Ukrainians. The U.S. assesses the defenders still have control of Brovary, just east of the capital, where in videos published last week we saw a column of Russian tanks hit. Kharkiv: Significant fighting continues over Kharkiv, with Russians relying more and more on long-range missile attacks. The U.S. sees a new line of advance with 50 to 60 vehicles moving from the southwest of Kharkiv down toward the town of Izyum. ""The assessment is that they are trying to block off the Donbass area and to prevent the flow westward of any Ukrainian armed forces that would be in the in the eastern part of the country, prevent them from coming to the assistance of other Ukrainian defenders near Kyiv,"" the official said. Mariupol: The city remains isolated and under heavy bombardment, with Russian forces to the north and east. Ukrainians continue to fight back, the official said. Mykolayiv: Russian forces remain roughly where they were Friday, about six to nine miles northeast of the city. Ukrainians continue to resist. It is unclear what the Russian plan is for Mykolayiv. ""It could be a left turn to move on Odessa from the ground or it could be they go north up towards Kiev,"" the official said. Odessa: The Pentagon still sees no sign of any looming amphibious assault on Odessa, according to the official. Ukrainians going after Russian supplies ""The Ukrainians, as we've said all along, they've been quite creative here. They're not simply going after combat capability -- tanks and armored vehicles and shooting down aircraft -- although they're doing all that. They are also deliberately trying to impede and prevent the Russians' ability to sustain themselves,"" the official said, citing the long Russian convoy as one example.",7,,,,14
2022-03-12,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/ukraine-drones-great-effect-russian-forces-pentagon-updates/story?id=83391603,Ukraine using drones to 'great effect' on Russian forces: Pentagon updates,"The Pentagon has been providing daily updates on the Russian invasion of Ukraine and Ukraine's efforts to resist. Here are highlights of what a senior U.S. defense official told reporters on Friday: Russia flying 20 times as many sorties as Ukraine Russian military planes are flying an average of 200 sorties per day, compared to only about 10 per day flown by Ukraine, according to the official. Much of the airspace above Ukraine is heavily guarded by both Ukrainian and Russian surface-to-air missiles, making air operations risky for both sides. But Russian aircraft don't have to enter Ukrainian airspace to do damage. ""You can launch cruise missiles from aircraft from a great distance away. And if your target is relatively close, you don't need to enter the airspace,"" the official said. For the first time, the official gave details on the total number of functioning Ukrainian fighter jets and how much they're being used. ""They have 56 available to them now, fully operational, and they're only flying them five to 10 hours a day,"" the official said. Ukraine needs drones, not jets: Official Noting Russia's vast umbrella of anti-aircraft capability over Ukraine and its larger air force, the official repeated some of the arguments we heard from the Pentagon earlier this week about the relative ineffectiveness of sending more aircraft to Ukraine. ""It makes little sense to us that additional fixed-wing aircraft is going to have somehow solve all these problems. What they need are surface-to-air missile systems, they need MANPADS, they need anti-armor, and they need small arms and ammunition, and they need these drones, because that's what they're using with great effect. And so, that's what we're focused on,"" the official said. Ukrainian forces are making ""terrific"" use of drones, especially against Russian ground movements, according to the official. The drones can be also used both for reconnaissance and surveillance. ""They're trained on how to use them, they can fly below radar coverage by the Russians,"" the official said. They are also much cheaper than fighter aircraft, and being unmanned, don't risk pilots being killed or captured. Chemical weapons and false flags The official said that despite claims from China and Russia, the U.S. is not helping Ukraine create or use any chemical or biological weapons. ""This is bio research with regard to two things: One, helping Ukraine over the years decrease the pathogen inventory that they had under Soviet years, and then to develop strategies to defeat pathogens going forward,"" the official said. ""It's scientific research, it's not bio-weapons capabilities."" The official said the U.S. has nothing to hide, and that information on its role in scientific work in Ukraine was already publicly available. ""The only reason why we elevated the discussion is because the Russians and the Chinese decided to lie about it -- just flat out lie,"" the official said. The official would not offer any U.S. intelligence assessment of the likelihood of Russian President Vladimir Putin deploying chemical or biological weapons in Ukraine. ""We know that the Russians have had -- and we assess that they still have -- a sophisticated chemical and biological weapons program. I'm not going to talk about intelligence assessments about what they may do with that program or what, if any, designs they might have on Ukraine in that regard,"" the official said. The official said Russia's ""ridiculous narrative"" could possibly ""be building a pretext for some sort of false flag event."" State of the invasion The push to Kyiv: Russians have not moved any closer to Kyiv from the northwest since yesterday, still approximately 9 miles from city center. But the U.S. has seen rear elements move up closer to those advance troops. Russians advancing on the capital from northeast now 12-19 miles out. Pentagon press secretary John Kirby told reporters Friday that the Russians coming from the east, while further from Kyiv, are gaining more ground than those to the northwest near the Hostomel Airport. ""We do assess that the Russians are beginning to make more momentum on the ground towards Kyiv, particularly from the east, not quite so much from the north,"" Kirby said. Kharkiv: Russians are ""closing in,"" but the city is well defended and hasn't been taken yet. Mariupol: The port city is under increasing pressure today. It is surrounded from northeast and southwest, under heavy bombardment, but Ukrainians are fighting back there. Kherson: The city remains under Russian control: ""We continue to assess that they have Kherson,"" the official said. Mykolayiv: Russian forces remain to the northeast of the city, though it is under increasing pressure. ""We've observed the Ukrainians are continuing to defend the city, and the Russians are just outside the city,"" the official said. Lutsk and Ivano-Frankovsk: The Russians struck airfields in each city Friday. ""Obviously, they wanted to eliminate the Ukrainians' ability to use these airfields,"" the official said. The official did not know how much the Ukrainians were using these two airfields or how extensive the damage was. ""What's unusual about it is that [the Russians] haven't been striking in western Ukraine,"" the official said of the strikes. Russian missile strikes The Russians have now launched nearly 810 missiles against Ukraine -- almost half have been fired from within Ukraine using mobile platforms. The rest have been fired from Russia, Belarus, and a small number from the Black Sea. This is up from an estimate of 775 missiles offered by the official Thursday. Majority of combat power intact Russia still has roughly 90% of its invading combat power still viable, with Ukraine falling just under 90%, the official said.",7,,,,14

Here are highlights of what a senior U.S. defense official told reporters on Thursday: Russians approaching Kyiv The Russian forces closest to the heart of Kyiv are coming from the northwest, in the area of the Hostomel Airport. Since Wednesday, these troops fought their way three miles closer, bringing them within roughly nine miles of the city center, according to the official. The airport is only about five miles as the bird flies from the outer city limits. Two parallel lines of advance from the northeast are also making progress on their push to the capital, the closest of these troops now about 25 miles from the center of Kyiv. Some Russian troops from one of those lines, emanating from above the town of Sumy, seem to have turned around, heading back northeast. The official said the reason for the about-face is unclear. Russian bombardment continues Russian forces have now fired more than 775 missiles against Ukraine, the official said. This is up from an estimate of 710 on Wednesday. No Patriots to Ukraine The official said there is no talk at the Pentagon of sending Patriot systems to Ukraine, as they would require U.S. troops on the ground to operate them. ""It's not a system that the Ukrainians are familiar with. And as we have made very clear, there will be no U.S. troops fighting in Ukraine,"" the official said. Other air-defense options for Ukraine Security assistance continues to flow into Ukraine, even in the last 24 hours, according to the official. While the U.S. is sending its own anti-armor and anti-aircraft weapons, it is also working with other countries to send items the U.S. doesn't have in its arsenal but could be used effectively by Ukrainian troops. When asked, the official said this includes air-defense systems that are ""more sophisticated"" than the shoulder-fired Stinger missiles being sent by the U.S. So, while the Pentagon has rejected the idea of sending Patriot missile batteries, it could be helping facilitate the transfer or replenishment of similar systems that Ukrainians are trained on. Ukraine making little use of its fighter jets The official repeated the Pentagon's rejection of a Polish proposal to pass its fleet of MiG-29 fighter jets to Ukraine by using the U.S. as an intermediary. ""We do not support a proposal whereby jets would be transferred to our custody, then to be brought into Ukraine,"" the official said. The Defense Department views sending aircraft to be an inferior form of support for Ukraine, despite Ukrainian officials' requests. ""They are not flying their fixed-wing aircraft very much on a daily basis. We're not making a judgment here, it's just a fact. What they are using very effectively to slow the Russian advance, particularly in the north, are their own surface-to-air missile systems and MANPADS, as well as ... anti-armor munitions,"" the official said.",49,,,,14

""Given Putin's track record, given the fact that he's someone who hates to act out of what he believes to be weakness, that he needs to concede or admit mistakes, that's probably a long shot,"" Burns said of any chance talks might succeed. A session Thursday in Turkey between the countries' top two diplomats failed to produce a cease-fire. Burns also told the Senate Intelligence Committee that Putin, at the same time, is turning Russia into a ""propaganda bubble."" ""He's intensified his domination of the state run media and in his strangulation of independent media, especially in recent years, and particularly since the invasion of Ukraine began."" ""I don't believe he can wall off [Russians] indefinitely from the truth, especially as realities began to puncture that bubble. The realities of killed and wounded coming home in an increasing number. The realities of the economic consequences for ordinary Russians as I was discussing before, the realities of you know, the horrific scenes of hospitals and schools being bombed next door and Ukraine, enough civilian casualties there as well. I don't think he can bottle up the truth indefinitely,"" he said. Intelligence agency leaders from around the government testified in the second of two hearings detailing their annual report on ""worldwide threats,"" after speaking to the House Intelligence Committee on Tuesday. Burns told Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, that the U.S. needs to ""focus"" on Russia's potential use of chemical weapons both in terms of a ""false flag"" operation and in reality. ""This is something as all of you know very well is very much a part of Russia's playbook,"" Burns said. ""They've used those weapons against their own citizens. They've at least encouraged the use in Syria and elsewhere. So, it's something we take very seriously."" He said believes the U.S. is adequately pushing back on the Russian narrative. ""In all the years I spent as a career diplomat, I saw too many instances in which we lost information wars with the Russians. In this case, I think we have had a great deal of effect in disrupting their tactics and their calculations and demonstrating to the entire world that this is a premeditated and unprovoked aggression, built on a body of lies and false narratives,"" he said. The head of U.S. Cyber Command, Gen. Paul Nakasone, defended U.S. information-sharing with Ukraine amid Republican suggestions the U.S. was holding back. ""The intelligence that we're sharing is accurate. It's relevant, and it's actionable. I think when we look back at this, that's the key piece of, of what we've been able to do as an intelligence community,"" he said. Defense Intelligence Agency Director Gen. Scott Berrier admitted he could have done a better job assessing problems Putin's military would have overcoming the Ukrainians' will to fight. ""So, we assessed prior to the invasion that he was overestimate or underestimating, rather, the Ukrainians ... resistance,"" he said. ""We did not do as well in terms of predicting the military challenges that he has encountered with his own military."" ""We made some assumptions about his assumptions, which proved to be very, very flawed,"" Berrier said. ""Among the many profoundly flawed assumptions that President Putin made in launching this invasion, was his assumption that he had built a sanctions-proof economy,"" Burns said. Putin, Burns said, thought he built a ""very large war chest to foreign currency reserves and gold reserves, and by not anticipating that the sanctions against the Russian Central Bank, by not anticipating that the German leadership would show such resolve in particular, I think he deeply underestimated the economic consequences, and I think they're just now being felt in Russia, and that's going to intensify.""",20,,,,1

At least three people, including a child, were killed in the airstrike, according to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Another 17 people, including women, children and medical workers, were wounded, he said. The Ukrainian leader accused Russian state media of lying about the lack of patients inside the hospital at the time of the attack. ""War crimes are impossible without propaganda that covers them,"" Zelenskyy said in a televised address Thursday. ""You will bear responsibility as well as those who give orders to throw bombs on peaceful people."" Zelenskyy had posted a video on social media Wednesday that he said showed the heavily damaged children's hospital and maternity ward in the southeastern Ukrainian port city. ""Direct strike of Russian troops at the maternity hospital,"" he said, calling on the international community again to impose a no-fly zone over Ukraine. ""People, children are under the wreckage. Atrocity! How much longer will the world be an accomplice ignoring terror?"" Pavlo Kirilenko, the head of the Donetsk regional military administration, claimed in a post on Facebook that a Russian aircraft deliberately targeted the 600-bed hospital. ""City center maternity hospital, hospital, children's ward and therapy -- all destroyed during a Russian aviation flight to Mariupol,"" he said. ""The Russians! You have not only crossed the border of unacceptable relations between states and peoples. You have crossed the line of humanity."" Russia's foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova claimed during a daily briefing Wednesday that Ukraine had put firing positions inside the children's hospital in Mariupol, though there is currently no evidence to support that allegation. The comment, however, appears to be an implicit acknowledgment that Russia deliberately targeted the hospital, as Kirilenko had claimed. UNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell said she was ""horrified"" by the reported attack on the hospital. ""We do not yet know the number of casualties but fear the worst,"" she said in a statement. ""This attack, if confirmed, underscores the horrific toll this war is exacting on Ukraine's children and families. In less than two weeks, at least 37 children have been killed and 50 injured, while more than 1 million children have fled Ukraine to neighboring countries.""

In a video conference Wednesday, Mariupol deputy mayor Serhiy Orlov said the city is on the ""brink of a humanitarian catastrophe"" and that ""'Russia is trying to wipe Mariupol from the face of the earth."" Orlov reported that 1,207 people have died in the city because of shelling and aerial attacks -- and that half of those killed were ethnic Russians. Among the casualties was a child who died from dehydration, according to Zelenskyy. The city has been burying its dead in a mass grave on the outskirts of Mariupol as it endures heavy shelling. New satellite imagery collected by commercial satellite company Maxar Technologies on Wednesday morning, before the reported shelling of the hospital, showed extensive damage to civilian infrastructure in and around the city, including residential homes, high-rise apartment buildings, grocery stores and shopping centers. Orlov accused Russia of indiscriminately bombarding the city because its forces were unable to break through its defenses, but he said that Mariupol would not surrender. He also called on the international community to impose a no-fly zone, an escalation that the White House and NATO allies have opposed. ""The Russian army cannot break our defenses and win on the ground, and this is why they are just bombing us relentlessly to break our spirit,"" he said. ""Our spirit is strong but we need help. To the outside world we say: Help us save our city! Close the skies! Impose a no-fly zone!""' ABC News' Patrick Reevell, Yulia Drozd and Christine Theodorou contributed to this report.",47,,,,7

2022-03-09,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/pentagon-rejects-polands-plan-make-us-provide-ukraine/story?id=83324397,Pentagon again rejects Poland's plan to make US provide Ukraine fighter jets,"The Pentagon on Wednesday, for the second day in a row, rejected a plan by Poland to provide Ukraine with its Soviet-era warplanes through U.S. hands, saying the proposal would risk wider war between Russia and NATO. Poland's announcement Tuesday, which shocked U.S. officials, peaked hope in Ukraine that President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's calls for more fighter jets would be answered. But Poland's proposal essentially punted the responsibility to the U.S. by calling for America to take control of the MiG-29 fighter jets at a U.S. air base in Germany and then provide them to Ukraine -- an idea the Pentagon roundly rejected as ""not tenable."" Hours after the White House left the door open to a deal Wednesday, saying ""logistical and operational"" details were being discussed among the U.S., its NATO allies, and Ukraine, there was another surprise: The Pentagon roundly rejected the idea altogether. ""We do not support the transfer of additional fighter aircraft to the Ukrainian Air Force at this time and, therefore, have no desire to see them in our custody either,"" Pentagon spokesperson John Kirby said Wednesday. The back-and-forth by both NATO allies has sparked confusion and exasperation. Poland originally opposed a transfer while the U.S. backed it -- until Poland suddenly proposed doing so through the U.S., which now opposes it. ""This is not pingpong. This is about people's lives. We ask again -- make the decision faster. Don't throw the responsibility. Send us the jets,"" Zelenskyy said in a speech Wednesday. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, recounting what she said was a 45-minute call with Zelenskyy about the U.S. providing lethal aid, said, ""He wants the planes, the planes, the planes."" Russia has warned any country from allowing Ukraine to use its airfields to support military aircraft, with Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov saying Wednesday, ""This is an extremely undesirable and potentially dangerous scenario."" U.S. intelligence has concluded the same thing, according to Kirby, who added that sending Ukraine additional fighter jets is not what Kyiv needs now in its fight against invading Russian forces and their overwhelming bombardment. ""There are alternative options that are much better suited to support the Ukrainian military in their fight against Russia. We will continue to pursue those options,"" Kirby told reporters Wednesday. Ukraine's air force already has ""several squadrons of fully mission capable aircraft,"" he added, and the U.S. instead plans to continue providing ""the systems that they need most to defeat Russian aggression -- in particular, anti-armor and air defense."" The U.S. has provided Ukraine with Stinger missiles -- shoulder-fired anti-aircraft missiles that previous administrations had viewed as too escalatory to provide. The United Kingdom announced Wednesday it would provide its similar system known as Starstreak. But for now, the U.S. is drawing the line against fighter jets, which U.S. officials say would be logistically difficult to deliver to Ukraine without risking Russian retaliation. ""The intelligence community has assessed the transfer of MiG-29s to Ukraine may be mistaken as escalatory and could result in significant Russian reaction that might increase the prospects of the military escalation with NATO,"" Kirby said. Just days ago, however, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the U.S. had given ""a green light"" to Poland to provide the planes directly to Ukraine, although he said it was Poland's choice. Polish officials opposed the idea, fearing exactly the scenario Kirby laid out -- with Russian strikes on Polish airfields. The Polish prime minister's office even called reports the country would provide warplanes ""FAKE NEWS‼️"" in a tweet Sunday. But two days later, Poland stunned the U.S. by saying it would provide over two dozen MiG-29 fighter jets to the U.S. ""immediately and free of charge,"" sending them to Ramstein Air Base and ""at the disposal of the Government of the United States of America."" ""That actually was a surprise move by the Poles,"" Victoria Nuland, Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs, told the Senate hours later, adding, ""It wasn't pre-consulted with us."" Surprise turned to opposition, with the Pentagon calling the plan ""not tenable"" for the risk it would pose to U.S. service members. U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin called Polish Minister of National Defense Mariusz Błaszczak Wednesday, thanking him, but expressing outright opposition, per Kirby. Western countries have significantly escalated their military aid to Ukraine, providing thousands of anti-tank missiles in recent weeks alone, according to a U.S. official. But warplanes now seem to be a step too far, along with a no-fly zone. U.S. and NATO officials have repeatedly warned their forces will not get involved in the conflict in any way, fearing a Russian attack that could quickly spiral into war between nuclear-armed states. Calls for a ""limited"" no-fly zone -- over western Ukraine to allow for refugees to exit and aid to enter, or over humanitarian corridors -- have fallen flat, too. ""Introducing, in our case, American service members in Ukraine, on Ukrainian territory or soil, or American pilots into Ukrainian airspace, whether on a full or on a limited basis, would almost certainly lead to direct conflict between the United States, between NATO and Russia, and that would expand the conflict. It would prolong it. It would make it much more deadlier than it already is,"" Blinken said Wednesday. To some analysts, a no-fly zone would not be a silver bullet here either, with the Kremlin using long-range artillery, even indiscriminate shelling, to grind Ukrainian forces and civilian targets down. Russia has now launched more than 710 missiles against Ukraine -- about half of which have been launched from within Russian territory, according to a senior U.S. defense official. ""The best way to help protect the skies is through anti-air weaponry, which the U.K. is now going to be supplying to Ukraine,"" British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said alongside Blinken at the State Department. While the Biden administration has said repeatedly it's consulting with allies and partners on what other military aid to provide, it's unclear what else it could be. Some 75 percent of a $350 million package approved by Biden late last month has already made it into Ukrainian hands, according to officials. But beyond individual missiles, the U.S. may be considering anti-missile batteries like the Patriot system. Nuland declined to speak publicly about that option, but told a Senate panel Tuesday there are ""other things"" on Ukraine's ""list that we think we can do, and I'll leave it at that.""

Here are highlights of what defense officials told reporters on Wednesday: Pentagon against rejects sending fighter jets to Ukraine On Tuesday evening, Pentagon press secretary John Kirby dismissed a surprise offer from Poland to send all of its MiG-29 fighter jets to a U.S. air base in Germany ""and place them at the disposal"" of the U.S. government. ""The prospect of fighter jets 'at the disposal of the Government of the United States of America' departing from a U.S./NATO base in Germany to fly into airspace that is contested with Russia over Ukraine raises serious concerns for the entire NATO alliance,"" Kirby said in a statement, adding that ""we do not believe Poland’s proposal is a tenable one."" On Wednesday, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin spoke to his Polish counterpart about the MiG-29 offer, thanking him for Poland's willingness to help Ukraine, but rejecting the notion of using the U.S. as an intermediary for any aircraft transfer. ""He stressed that we do not support the transfer of additional fighter aircraft to the Ukrainian air force at this time, and therefore have no desire to see them in our custody either,” Kirby said during a press conference at the Pentagon. Kirby characterized the idea as high risk, low reward -- the risk being possible escalation by Russian President Vladimir Putin. ""The intelligence community has assessed the transfer of MiG-29s to Ukraine may be mistaken as escalatory and could result in significant Russian reaction that might increase the prospects of military escalation with NATO,"" he said. In addition to that risk, the U.S. believes other forms of military support are more effective. ""We believe the best way to support Ukrainian defense is by providing them the weapons and the systems that they need most to defeat Russian aggression,"" Kirby said. ""In particular, anti-armor and air defense."" The U.S. has sent hundreds of millions of dollars worth of military aid into Ukraine, including anti-tank and anti-aircraft weapons such as the Javelin and Stinger systems. Earlier on Wednesday, a senior U.S. defense official told reporters Russian anti-air capability now spans much of Ukrainian airspace, which also makes aircraft less viable in the fight against the invaders. Kirby added that the Ukrainian air force still has several squadrons of ""fully mission-capable"" aircraft of its own. ""We assess that adding aircraft to the Ukrainian inventory is not likely to significantly change the effectiveness of Ukrainian Air Force relative to Russian capabilities. While the U.S. has rejected the idea for now, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has continued to call for more aircraft. ""This is about people's lives. We ask again: make the decision faster. Don't throw the responsibility -- send us the jets,"" Zelenskyy said in a Wednesday speech. And the skies above Ukraine are not yet dominated by Russia. On Wednesday morning, the U.K. Ministry of Defense tweeted an intelligence update saying ""Ukrainian air defenses appear to have enjoyed considerable success against Russia's modern combat aircraft, probably preventing them from achieving any degree of control of the air."" ""Although Russian air capabilities are significant, their effectiveness has been limited due to Ukrainian ... air-defense systems, surface-to-air missiles, and MANPADS,"" Kirby said. Patriot batteries arrive in Poland Late on Tuesday evening, U.S. European Command confirmed that two Patriot anti-missile systems already in Europe would be moved to Poland. By Wednesday they had arrived, according to the senior U.S. defense official. ""We're not going to talk about where they are, I'm not going to talk about their operational status, but they are in Poland and they are manned,"" the official said. The Patriot systems are capable of detecting and intercepting incoming ballistic missiles. Russian missiles and 'dumb' munitions Russia has now fired more than 710 missiles against Ukraine, with about half launched from within Ukraine using mobile platforms, according to the official. The U.S. has also seen indications Russia is using ""dumb"" munitions, meaning ordnance that is not precision-guided. The official said it is not clear if these imprecise weapons are being used as part of the original Russian plan or due to problems with their guided missile targeting process. ""What we see manifested is increasing damage to civilian infrastructure and civilian casualties,"" the official said. Russian combat power Russia has about 90% of its invading combat power still intact, the official said. On Tuesday, the estimate was 95%, but the official emphasized that these numbers are rough estimates, so it doesn't necessarily mean 5% of Russian forces were taken out of the fight overnight. No sign Putin preparing reserve forces The U.S. still sees no indications Putin is trying to gather any more troops in addition to the more than 150,000 originally designated for the invasion, the official said. Russia's ground effort Since Tuesday, Russians have further closed in on Kharkiv, gaining about 12 miles of ground. ""It's still heavy, heavy fighting there,"" the official said. ""We don't assess that they've taken the city by any means."" The U.S. has not seen any significant Russian movement toward Kyiv or Chernihiv in the last 24 hours, and there is still no sign of an an immanent amphibious assault on Odessa. Ukrainians have mounted a strong resistance in Mariupol, but Russians continue to surround and bombard the city.",49,,,,13

""The [Intelligence Community], as you know, provided warning of President Putin's plans, but this is a case where I think all of us wish we had been wrong,"" Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines told the House Intelligence Committee at its annual hearing on worldwide threats. Russia's failure to rapidly seize Kiev and overwhelm Ukrainian forces has deprived Moscow of the quick military victory they probably had originally expected would prevent the United States and NATO from being able to provide meaningful military aid to Ukraine."" Adding that the U.S. is seeing an ""ill-constructed plan, morale issues and considerable logistical issues"" among Russian troops, Haines said it is ""unclear"" whether Russia will pursue a plan to capture all of Ukraine, but that it's already loosening its rules of engagement. ""Russian forces are at the very least operating with reckless disregard for the safety of noncombatants, as Russian units launch artillery and airstrikes into urban areas as they have done in cities across Ukraine and near critical infrastructures such as the nuclear plant, and the IC is engaged across the interagency to document and hold Russia and Russian actors accountable for their actions,"" she said. ""We assess Putin feels aggrieved. The West has not given proper deference and perceives this as a war he cannot afford to lose,"" Haines said. CIA Director William Burns, a former U.S. ambassador to Moscow who has studied Putin for years, concurred that the Russian president is ""angry and frustrated"" by the situation in Ukraine, and will likely step up his efforts. ""He's likely to double down and try to grind down the Ukrainian military with no regard for civilian casualties,"" Burns testified. ""He has no sustainable political endgame in the face of what is going to continue to be fierce resistance from Ukrainians."" ""Putin has commented privately and publicly over the years that he doesn't believe Ukraine's a real country,"" Burns continued. ""He's dead wrong about that -- real countries fight back. And that's what the Ukrainians have done quite heroically over the last 12 days."" ""I think he's been unsettled by the Western reaction and allied resolve particularly some of the decisions the German government has taken. I think he's been unsettled by the performance of his own military,"" he said. ""The big countries don't get to swallow up small countries just because they can."" He called Putin's actions in the past two weeks ""premeditated and savage."" Asked about Putin's mental state, Burns did not answer directly, but did say Putin's views on Ukraine have ""hardened over the years."" ""I think he's far more insulated from other points of view and people who would challenge or question his views in but in my opinion that doesn't make him crazy, but it makes them extremely difficult to deal with because of the hardening of his views over time and a narrowing of his inner circle,"" he said. National Security Agency Director Gen. Paukl Nakasone said the U.S. had gamed out scenarios for a Russian cyberattack. ""We have to get better , we have to harden our infrastructure and have ability to be resilient,"" he said.

2022-03-08,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/dhs-identified-specific-threat-information-related-jan-watchdog/story?id=83324444,DHS 'identified specific threat information' related to Jan. 6: Watchdog,"The Department of Homeland Security Office of Intelligence and Analysis ""identified specific threat information related to the events on January 6, 2021, but did not issue any intelligence products about these threats until January 8,"" according to a DHS inspector general report released Tuesday. ""Open source collectors in I&A's Current and Emerging Threats Center collected open source threat information but did not produce any actionable information,"" the inspector general's report concluded, saying the information was identified ""weeks"" before the attack on the U.S. Capitol. The report said that was because of an inexperienced intelligence collector who didn't receive proper training as well as a ""hesitancy"" to report information after the 2020 summer of unrest. During the summer of 2020, the unit faced criticism for compiling intelligence on journalists reporting on the events, as well as non-violent protesters. The report was first reported by CNN. The mission of the Intelligence and Analysis unit at DHS, according to the IG, is to provide information to state and local law enforcement partners on various issues of national attention. ""I&A's Counterterrorism Mission Center (CTMC) identified indicators that the January 6, 2021 events might turn violent but did not issue an intelligence product outside I&A, even though it had done so for other events,"" the report said. They did email information the agency had to local Washington, D.C., law enforcement agencies but that is as far as the communication went, the report said. On the morning of Jan. 6, the deputy secretary of Homeland Security was briefed on potential violence at the Capitol, but did not disseminate any intelligence products relating to the threat of violence, the inspector general found. Some of the information collected by the unit were online calls by event organizers to bring weapons to the event and more lethal weapons. ""An individual claimed there would not be enough law enforcement officers to stop the number of armed people arriving in the area,"" an assessment of the online activity from December 30th says. In another instance, an I&A intelligence collector messaged colleagues indicating individuals were sharing a map of the U.S. Capitol online. ""I feel like people are actually going to try and hurt politicians. Jan 6th is gonna be crazy, not to mention the inauguration,"" an unnamed intelligence collector wrote on Jan. 2. A day later, collectors found chatter discussing ""hanging politicians,"" but maintained these threats did not meet their reporting threshold. Ultimately, according to the inspector general, the collectors did not think storming the Capitol was remotely possible and dismissed these notions. Comparatively, the inspector general said DHS distributed information on possible violence stemming from the riots in Portland, Oregon, over the summer, but it had less threat indicators than that of perspective violence at the Capitol. The inspector general also says DHS shared ""limited"" information with state and local partners. Shortly after the FBI Norfolk office published an intelligence product about individuals who wanted to establish a ""quick reaction force"" in Northern Virginia, which did prove true according to court documents, I&A analysts shared their information in a limited scope with local law enforcement. As a response to the inspector general report, I&A is improving their information sharing and training capabilities. In a message to all Intelligence and Analysis Unit staff, acting Director John Cohen said they are working to strengthen the I&A capabilities. ""We have embarked on many improvements to bolster our intelligence collection and analysis, clarify guidance for intelligence officers, improve information sharing and operational coordination, and identify new resources to combat domestic violent extremism (DVE),"" Cohen wrote in an email obtained by ABC News. ""We will continue to build on the positive momentum we made in 2021, implement new and necessary changes as we adapt to the next generation of threats, and remain focused on the defense of the Homeland."" ""As Secretary Mayorkas has said, the attack on the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021 was a violent assault on our democracy. Over the past fourteen months, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has strengthened intelligence analysis, information sharing, and operational preparedness to help prevent acts of violence and keep our communities safe,"" a DHS spokesperson told ABC News in response to the report's release. The spokesperson said the agency has increased their information sharing with partners from across government and bringing all the department's resources to bare in ways that ""protect privacy, civil rights, and civil liberties, and adhere to applicable laws.""",20,,,,17

Here are highlights of what a senior U.S. defense official told reporters on Tuesday: Russian forces mostly still intact Nearly all Russian forces arrayed at the Ukrainian border for the invasion have now gone in, according to the official. Despite losing troops, ground vehicles and aircraft in the fighting, the official estimated these forces remain roughly 95% intact. Russian ground efforts stalled in the north Russian troops approaching Kyiv have made little progress in recent days, according to the official. ""We continue to see Ukrainian resistance efforts slow down the Russians, particularly in the north,"" the official said. Another factor is that ""they still seem to be plagued by logistics and sustainment challenges,"" including fuel and food shortages, the official said. The Pentagon also continues to see fighting and resistance against the Russian advance in the northern cities of Chernihiv and Kharkiv. The farthest the main Russian force heading to Kyiv seems to have been able to reach is Hostomel Airport, a site of intense combat some 20 miles northwest of the city. But their intent is clear, the official said: ""We still have every reason to assess that their effort is to encircle and force the surrender of Kiev."" A new Russian approach emerges Further out than those advance troops, a Russian push toward the capital is emerging in the northeast, just above the town of Sumy, the official said. These troops are roughly 37 miles from Kyiv. Russians try to ""sow fear and confusion"" in the city While the main invading force has not reached Kyiv, the official was in ""no position to refute"" reports of minor, isolated skirmishes between Russian ""reconnaissance elements"" and Ukrainian forces inside the city. ""We think that these reports of street fighting in Kyiv are really the result of their efforts to sow fear and confusion and and try to set the stage for what could be coming later,"" the official said. Strikes on civilians continue Russian air and missile attacks are increasing as their ground effort has been frustrated, according to the official. ""Whether intentionally or not, they're hitting military and government infrastructure as well as residential areas and civilian targets,"" the official said. Russians see more success in the south Russian troops advancing to the northwest out of Crimea are about 25 miles from Mykolayiv, the official said. The official noted that while there is speculation that the move on Mykolayiv is meant to put troops in position to attack the port city of Odessa from the north as amphibious troops assault from the coast, ""we don't see any evidence of amphibious landings"" at this point. On the Sea of Azov coast, Russian forces have isolated Mariupol and continue to bombard it with long-range attacks. Thousands of troops put ashore in an amphibious landing on the second day of the invasion are approaching the city from the southwest as more troops push down from Donetsk. U.S.-Russia deconfliction line in working order Last week Pentagon press secretary John Kirby announced it had set up a ""deconfliction line"" with Russia to ""reduce the chances of miscalculations and try to bring down the tensions as that contested airspace over Ukraine now bumps up against NATO airspace."" The senior defense official said that as of Tuesday, the two countries have used the line about a dozen times, but so far only for test calls to make sure ""somebody's picking up on the other end.""

2022-03-08,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/ukraine-pleads-western-war-planes-us-deliver/story?id=83298160,Ukraine pleads for Western warplanes. Will the US help deliver?,"Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has made repeated and passionate pleas now for the U.S. and NATO to implement a 'no-fly' zone over his country and ground Russian warplanes -- through intimidation or force. But he's also made another ask -- one that President Joe Biden's administration said it is working with allies like Poland to facilitate -- for fighter jets to replenish the Ukrainian air force. ""We know where these Soviet planes are stationed, which countries host them, and we asked these countries,"" Zelenskyy told ABC News's David Muir in an exclusive interview Monday, adding Biden ""can do more, I'm sure he can, and I would like to believe that, that he's capable of doing that."" U.S. officials, including Secretary of State Antony Blinken, have said the administration is working to address this, including by possibly replenishing Poland's air force with U.S. jets. But amid growing pressure from U.S. lawmakers to do so, the White House and Pentagon said Monday it's not as simple as handing over keys -- especially as Russian leader Vladimir Putin eyes growing Western military aid for Ukraine as inching toward a direct role in the war. ""We are not, certainly, preventing or blocking or discouraging Poland -- that is, they are a sovereign country. They make their own decisions. But it is not as easy as moving planes around,"" White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Monday. ""It's just a discussion about the possibility of, should there be a nation that would want to give aircraft to the Ukrainians and would ask for a backfill from the United States -- should that happen, what would that look like?"" Pentagon spokesperson John Kirby said shortly after. Putin has warned that any country attempting to implement a 'no-fly' zone over Ukraine would ""immediately"" become ""party to the military conflict"" -- the kind of slide to a wider war that U.S. and NATO officials said they're working to avoid. But U.S. officials are concerned that increasing U.S. military support to include warplanes could be seen as a step too far for Putin, too. In dramatic fashion, the U.S. and several Western countries have shifted what aid they're willing to provide, including shoulder-fired anti-aircraft missiles known as Stingers. Germany, long opposed to providing lethal military aid to war zones, has moved to boost its defense spending and agreed to provide Stingers as well. Whereas the Obama administration once held off on providing anti-tank missiles known as Javelins, the Biden administration and other U.S. allies have provided thousands in just the last couple weeks, according to a U.S. official. But so far, that line has been drawn at military aircraft and advanced missile defense systems. ""In addition to assisting getting the Ukrainians fighter aircraft and letting them fly out of Polish airfields with full NATO protection, we need to provide them medium- and long-range air defense systems,"" said Mick Mulroy, a former top Pentagon official and retired CIA officer. ""The Stinger system is very effective, but its range is limited. Russian planes are flying at altitudes that make them out of reach."" Polish officials have expressed strong opposition and deep concerns about precisely that, with the fear that Putin would strike Polish airfields for supporting Ukrainian fighter jets. Psaki brushed aside Putin's role, telling reporters, ""We're not waiting for the advice of Vladimir Putin on what we're going to do here as it relates to backfilling planes."" But she added again it's Poland's right to decide. For now, it seems Warsaw is the one opposed. The Polish prime minister's office called reports the country would provide Soviet-era MiG-29 fighter jets and Su-25 attack aircraft ""FAKE NEWS‼️"" in a tweet Sunday -- adding, ""Poland won't send its fighter jets to #Ukraine as well as allow to use its airports. We significantly help in many other areas."" It's possible the U.S. could provide enough protection to calm Polish nerves and enough support to make it worth Poland's while, according to some analysts. Chief among them would be giving Poland more F-16 fighter aircraft. But that's a lengthy process that could leave Poland without air cover as it waits on those U.S. replacement jets. Either way, Zelenskyy and other Ukrainian officials said they need air support now, including during a briefing Zelenskyy held with more than 300 U.S. lawmakers and staff on Saturday that bolstered bipartisan support for his government. In the days since, several top lawmakers have publicly urged the Biden administration to ensure Ukraine gets more warplanes, including several top Democrats openly pressuring the president. Sen. Bob Menendez, D-N.J., the chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, urged Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin in a letter Monday to push NATO allies to provide aircraft ""without delay."" ""Asking them to provide their own aircraft, especially as Russia's military aggression edges closer to their own borders, would be unthinkable except in the direst circumstances. Unfortunately, that is the situation the world faces. Extraordinary times require extraordinary measures and sacrifices,"" he wrote to the cabinet officials. In the meantime, some 70% of the latest package of U.S. military assistance -- which totaled $350 million and brought aid in the last year to $1 billion -- is already in Ukrainian hands, Blinken said Monday. But he conceded Russia's military outguns and outmans Ukraine's, saying the Kremlin has ""the ability to continue to grind down the Ukrainian military and, of course, to take horrific actions against the Ukrainian people, including attacking civilians.""

2022-03-06,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/International/nato-implement-measures-isolate-putin-targets-civilians-analysis/story?id=83270236,NATO could implement measures to isolate Putin as he targets civilians: ANALYSIS,"The reports of Russia targeting civilian areas in Ukraine may not be surprising to most. Over the past decade, Russian President Vladimir Putin's military has allegedly killed thousands of civilians sheltering in cities across Syria. Putin reportedly used thermobaric weapons in attacks there to save Bashar Assad's regime. The Russian army was accused of killing Syrian civilians between May and July of 2016 with 47 separate cluster munition attacks. The Russian air force also conducted massive airstrikes, allegedly targeting civilians in Hama and Aleppo at schools and hospitals. Allegedly with Russian support, the Assad regime was accused of using chemical weapons in Douma, Syria, on April 7, 2018, reportedly killing between 40 and 50 people, including women and children. Together, the United States, the United Kingdom, and France responded on April 14, 2018, with airstrikes against regime facilities used to manufacture and facilitate the use of chemical weapons. Some experts fear Putin might turn to chemical weapons again, this time to terrorize the Ukrainian people if his military continues to perform poorly. Many believe he views chemical weapons as a legitimate means to fight in urban terrain to penetrate underground shelters, killing combatants and non-combatants alike. As the Russian military continues to fail in its efforts to conquer Ukraine, Ukrainian officials have accused Russia of turning to attacks against the civilian population and the use of weapons like cluster bombs and thermobaric munitions on residential areas. As a result of the Russian military's apparent inadequacies, many expect the targeting of Ukrainian civilians to increase. The International Criminal Court announced it has launched an investigation into allegations of war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide committed in Ukraine by Russia. Everyone in the Russian chain of command carrying out illegal orders to target civilians could be prosecuted under international law. And, if Russian officers can be positively identified, some will seek to publicly name them. If they travel anywhere outside of Russia, every country could be required to detain and deport them to the Hague. If they hide in Russia, no sanctions would be removed until Russia voluntarily sends them to the Hague. Officials across the world will look to consequences for countries and individuals who deliberately target innocent civilians. Targeting civilians is not what soldiers do. It's what war criminals do. At some point, the international community will ask: When do we stop Putin? After 5,000 Ukrainians are killed? 10,000? 100,000? Never? Do we take the risk of escalating the conflict with a nuclear-armed state run by a dictator? Along with severe sanctions, the United States could act to get Russia removed from the United Nations Security Council immediately. Countries could also expel all Russian diplomats, shuttering Russian embassies in the process, while making all of those that keep Putin in power for their benefit isolated by targeting the oligarchs and his inner circle. Putin wants to restore Russian power and prestige. The U.S. and its allies could seek to make it clear he knows that invading a sovereign country is not the path to achieve this; it is a path leading away from it. A key goal would be to ensure that Putin doesn't push his army further westward. NATO would establish a buffer zone dividing Russia from the rest of Europe, patrolled by NATO military aircraft and air defense systems. It would clarify to Putin that an incursion into another country neighboring by Russia will not be permitted. NATO's aim would be to not allow him to build up his forces to invade another country. Military deterrents would be accompanied by expediting the inclusion of Finland, Moldova, and Sweden into NATO if they request to join. President Putin might see that his actions have led to the very circumstances he claimed to be concerned were happening. Putin has already deemed NATO's current sanctions ""akin to a declaration of war."" But NATO could look past Russia's ""manufactured threats,"" choosing to moving forward with the defense of its member nations. NATO could isolate Russia economically, diplomatically, geographically, and double down on military support to the Ukrainians in their effort to save their country.

2022-03-03,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/us-documenting-russian-strikes-ukrainian-civilians-stopping-short/story?id=83213246,US documenting Russian strikes on Ukrainian civilians but stopping short of calling them war crimes,"Russia is hitting civilian targets in Ukraine, killing innocent people and destroying hospitals, schools and critical infrastructure like running water, electricity and gas, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken alleged Wednesday. But President Joe Biden and his administration have stopped short of accusing the Kremlin of conducting war crimes in its invasion of Ukraine so far, with the top U.S. diplomat saying instead they are ""looking very closely at what's happening"" and ""documenting it."" The U.S. and its NATO allies continue to provide Ukraine with assistance, including anti-aircraft missiles known as Stingers, a senior U.S. official confirmed. But that lethal military aid, overwhelming condemnation at the United Nations and the flight of Western businesses and crippling sanctions, including new ones announced Wednesday, have yet to change Vladimir Putin's calculus as he seeks to topple Ukraine's government. Instead, Russia is increasingly switching to using indiscriminate bombardment to terrorize cities into submission -- a tactic Putin's forces honed previously in Chechnya and Syria and that seems to have secured them their first major Ukrainian city, Kherson. Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, has been pummeled with heavy artillery, rockets and airstrikes, destroying apartment buildings and government offices alike. Another major city, Mariupol, is under ferocious, continual bombardment with rocket barrages and ballistic missile strikes, knocking out the power. Schools, hospitals and residences; buses, cars and ambulances; and infrastructure like drinking water, electricity,and gas amid Ukraine's bitter winter have all been hit. ""These aren't military targets. They are places where civilians work and families live,"" Blinken told reporters, adding, ""This is shameful."" But while Biden said Wednesday morning he believed Russia is intentionally targeting civilian infrastructure, Blinken stopped short of that, saying the U.S. is still assessing particular strikes. ""We're looking very closely at what's happening in Ukraine right now, including what's happening to civilians. We're taking account of it, we're documenting it, and we want to ensure, among other things, that there's accountability for it,"" he told reporters Wednesday. The International Criminal Court announced Wednesday it would launch an immediate investigation into possible war crimes in Ukraine after 38 member states, including the United Kingdom and Canada, referred reported atrocities to the ICC. ""Our work in the collection of evidence has now commenced,"" ICC Prosecutor Karim A.A. Khan said in a statement. Khan announced Monday that he would request to open a probe, which requires either authorization from a pre-trial ICC chamber or a referral by member states. Ukraine, like Russia and the U.S., is not a member state. Under the ICC's founding document, the Rome Statute, ""intentionally directing attacks against the civilian population as such or against individual civilians not taking direct part in hostilities"" is a violation of international law. Russia has outright denied that it has struck any civilians or civilian infrastructure. Amnesty International, among other human rights groups, reported Tuesday that it had documented ""the escalation in violations of humanitarian and human rights law, including deaths of civilians resulting from indiscriminate attacks on civilian areas and infrastructure."" ""Strikes on protected objects such as hospitals and schools, the use of indiscriminate weapons such as ballistic missiles, and the use of banned weapons such as cluster bombs may all qualify as war crimes,"" the group said. While Blinken wouldn't go that far, he compared Russia's tactics in Ukraine to previous conflicts, where its forces were ""absolutely brutal in trying to cow the citizenry of a given country, and that includes at the very least indiscriminate targeting and potentially deliberate targeting as well."" To fight back, the U.S. provided several hundred anti-aircraft missiles, known as Stingers, to the Ukrainian military Tuesday, a senior U.S. official confirmed to ABC News. The missiles were part of a $350 million package Biden approved late Friday night, bringing total U.S. military aid to approximately $1 billion. Before Putin launched his war, U.S. aid had been shipped in on regular flights to the capital Kyiv, where the airport has been shut down. Still, the U.S. has been successfully delivering military aid, according to Blinken, who declined to offer details on how. ""We are very actively working -- every day, every hour -- to provide that assistance,"" Blinken said of the U.S. and its NATO allies, adding, ""Vitally needed assistance is getting to where it needs to go."" The U.S. also unveiled new sanctions Wednesday that target Russia's oil and gas sector, its defense industry and its ally Belarus. New export controls will bar oil and gas extraction equipment and refining technology, preventing Russian firms ""from maintaining and upgrading current projects and, to some degree, from launching new projects,"" the White House said. The State Department is also implementing ""full blocking sanctions"" on 22 entities in Russia's defense sector, while the Commerce Department is extending export controls on Russia to include Belarus, to prevent the country from transferring semiconductors and other technology to its powerful neighbor and ally.

2022-02-28,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/International/ukraine-mounting-stiff-resistance-inflicting-painful-casualties-russia/story?id=83145245,"Ukraine mounting stiff resistance, inflicting painful casualties on Russia","KYIV -- There is growing evidence that Ukraine is managing to inflict significant casualties on Russian forces as they try to advance deeper into the country -- and that the swift strike Russia hoped to carry out on the capital, Kyiv, has been slowed by intense and popular resistance. Russia hasn't managed to make significant progress in the last two days. The main Russian force pushing down from Belarus towards Kyiv does not appear to have advanced closer towards the city since coming within about 20 miles, although smaller advanced groups have been fighting gun battles with Ukrainian forces inside the capital since at least Friday. Ukraine's military claims the Russian troops are struggling with fuel and logistics supplies. Images and videos of destroyed Russian military vehicles and tanks, which have been verified, have been circulating online. One example of the effective Ukrainian resistance took place Sunday when Russia appeared to mount a half-hearted attempt to destroy resistance in Ukraine's second city, Kharkiv. Russian special forces units in light armored vehicles tried to push into Kharkiv after indiscriminately bombarding the city with artillery, but they were rapidly destroyed by Ukrainian troops and volunteer territorial defense, according to videos posted online. Kharkiv's Mayor Oleg Sinegubov on Sunday night pushed a triumphant message, saying that ""control over Kharkiv is completely ours"" and that Ukrainian forces had succeeded ""in a full clearing of the city of the enemy."" Sinegubov said dozens of Russian troops had surrendered with little fight, sometimes in whole groups of five to 10 men, with some abandoning their equipment. A number of military analysts -- including those that correctly predicted the invasion -- believed Russia had hoped for a lightning ""shock and awe"" advance to the edge of Kyiv in the first days that would lead to President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's government surrendering without Russia needing to actually seize the city. Instead, the resistance is growing, officials said. ""It is clear they hoped to get Zelenskyy to surrender quickly without inflicting heavy casualties on the Ukrainian military [and] civilians. That failed, but their execution still appears to be fairly restrained,"" Rob Lee, analyst from Kings College London's War Department, wrote on Twitter on Sunday. Lee said that strategy had now failed, and that Russia would have to move to a plan B, which he feared would mean ""more force."" Time is working against Russia. Ukrainian popular resistance is gaining in self-confidence, and the Russian piecemeal strategy so far has allowed cities more time to set up defenses, putting in place barricades and distributing thousands of weapons. In Berdyansk, the only major city Russia has gained full control of, videos posted to social media Monday showed a crowd of residents angrily chanting a slogan insulting President Vladimir Putin at Russian troops guarding a government building on the main square. At the same time, the international response is also growing, with more sanctions and moves aimed at crippling Russia's economy, while European countries are sending more and more weapons to bolster the Ukrainian defense, with the European Union also announcing that for the first time it would provide Ukrainian officials with military support. Russia has so far held back its main army and has been using its air and artillery power against military targets, avoiding widespread, intense bombardment against civilian areas. Analysts, including Lee, said Russia appeared to have initially sought to inflict limited casualties on Ukrainian civilians and the military, likely out of concern about backlash in Russia and making it harder to achieve a swift political change in Ukraine, as well as a stronger international reaction. U.S. officials and independent analyst now fear if Russia's attempt to overpower Ukraine quickly fails, it may turn to using more brute force to achieve it. That could mean unleashing indiscriminate artillery and airstrikes to destroy Ukraine's military and terrorize civilians, as well as besieging cities. That already appears to be happening in Kharkiv, where Russia in the last two days has fired heavy artillery, including ""Grad"" multiple rocket launchers onto the city, causing significant damage to civilian buildings. ""I think today we've seen a shift in Russian targeting towards critical civilian infrastructure, greater use of MLRS, and artillery in suburban areas. Unfortunately, my concern that this was going to get a lot more ugly and affect civilians is starting to materialize,"" Michael Kofman, an analyst at CNA, who also predicted the invasion as likely, tweeted late Saturday. U.S. officials caution, though, that Russia still has major combat power yet to be deployed, with roughly half its forces massed near Ukraine still not engaged. A massive 3-mile-long column of hundreds of vehicles has formed up in northern Ukraine after crossing from Belarus and appears to be moving towards Kyiv.",7,,,,11
2022-02-25,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/International/shields-cyberattack-affect-americans-prepare/story?id=83085211,Shields up: How a possible cyberattack could affect Americans and how to prepare,"As Russia's military continues to strike Ukrainian cities, national security officials are keeping eyes on a different battlefield. Senior U.S. law enforcement and Homeland Security officials have told ABC News that there is growing concern that Russia could launch further cyberattacks against the West. The potential targets include electrical grids, banking systems and mobile networks, according to the officials. Currently, there is no cyber threat to the U.S. homeland, according to the Department of Homeland security. Cybersecurity experts tell ABC News that people shouldn't panic over a potential cyberattack, but they should start preparing for one. ""Freaking out is not a productive thing to do. There are lots of reasons to think that the fact that something is out there but that doesn't mean it could happen,"" Stuart Madnick, the founding director of Cybersecurity at MIT Sloan, told ABC News. ""But there are still a number of things that people can do to stay safe and protected."" Madnick, whose group has consulted with U.S. agencies and private companies such as Nasdaq, said the world is in uncharted territory when it comes to cyber security since this involves alleged cyberattacks by a major superpower. However, what has transpired so far is similar to previous cyber security incidents, he said. There are two types of cyberattacks, he said: ones that have an indirect impact on people's livelihood and attacks targeting the tech of specific people. The biggest indirect hacking examples in the past have targeted key infrastructure points such as the Colonial Pipeline ransomware attack in May 2021, which affected everything from gas prices to flights. ""In the last two years, we've been seeing more of these attacks around the world,"" Madnick said. ""You need to realize how many of our systems are connected to computers and just one hack can have bigger effects."" U.S. and international officials have accused the Russian government of committing cyber attacks that targeted Ukraine's banks in recent weeks. On Friday, Ukrainian officials warned of a phishing scheme emanating from Belarus, which pretended to be a member of the Ukrainian cybersecurity agency. Javed Ali, the former senior director of counterterrorism at the National Security Council, told ABC News that the attacks could escalate to affect utilities, such as gas and electricity. ""Those will be escalatory steps from Russia and that will also likely be integrated with physical military operations all designed to bring cascading effects against Ukraine,"" he said. Madnick warned that cyberattacks on the Ukrainian computer systems could potentially spill over to other regions depending on how close computer networks work. However, he noted, that U.S. officials are paying close attention to online activity. Ali said it's hard to predict if Russia would take such an action on the West since it would mean an immediate retaliation from countries with their own state-of-the-art tools and tactics. ""The thresholds for those operations being launched, the effects, [and] the duration those are all things would have to be thought through very carefully,"" Ali said. ""But U.S. Cyber Command is the lead for military operations from the United States, has a world-class capability."" The Department of Homeland Security, the agency tasked with the domestic response to the invasion in Ukraine, has set up a page on the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency’s website specifically warning of cyber-attacks emanating from Russia. Earlier this week, the U.S. Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency sent an advisory to businesses and organizations urging them to enact a ""shields up"" guidance. ""While there are not currently any specific credible threats to the U.S. homeland, we are mindful of the potential for the Russian government to consider escalating its destabilizing actions in ways that may impact others outside of Ukraine,"" the agency said in its letter. The federal government has called on businesses to make sure their information technology teams update their computer software to close any vulnerabilities and train their employees to watch out for any malware. Madnick said the preparedness of such attacks varies by sector and their experience as cyberattack victims. ""Organizations like banks that have been targeted for a long time have done a better job in shoring up their cybersecurity,"" he said. ""Others, like hospitals and smaller municipalities that haven’t been attacked in the past tend not to do well."" Madnick said when it comes to individual Americans, there is very little they could do to prevent an indirect attack on the country's infrastructure systems, but they should always prepare for the possibility. He likened it to preparing for a big storm and suggested that individuals who are concerned about their money should always have cash available for emergencies. Madnick also urged people to back up their important computer files, including bank statements, important e-mails and other documents frequently and to offline sources such as an external drive. ""Everyone should be doing this regardless of increasing cyber threats,"" he said. Madnick said cyber attackers linked to foreign agencies wouldn't likely conduct attacks that target individual Americans, but people should still be mindful of the vulnerabilities in their tech. Having updated anti-virus and malware software, staying on top of computer updates and avoiding any suspicious links and e-mails, go a long way he said. ""Cyberattacks and cyber security are not something we talk about a lot, but we need to,"" he said. ""This is not a brand new issue."" ABC News' Pierre Thomas contributed to this report.",20,,,,5
2022-02-25,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/International/questions-ukraine-russia-conflict-answered/story?id=83085067,"Questions about the Ukraine-Russia conflict, answered","Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday launched an all-out military assault on Ukraine after weeks of denying ""hysteria"" from the West about the possibility of a Russian invasion. Despite calling the attack a ""special military operation"" in the eastern Donbas region, bombing campaigns began across almost the entirety of Ukraine, including near the capital of Kyiv, and Russian forces crossed borders from three sides of Ukraine, including Russian-occupied Crimea to the south and Ukraine's neighbor Belarus to the north. Putin claimed Russia's plans did not include occupying Ukraine, while warning other countries not to interfere or ""face consequences greater than any you have faced in history."" This is not the first time in recent years that Russia has invaded Ukraine, a former Soviet republic. In 2014, Russia invaded Ukraine and annexed Crimea. Here's what we know and don't: Why is Putin invading Ukraine? In December, the Kremlin published two draft treaties laying out its demands as it massed troops and weaponry around Ukraine. Chief among them were ""security guarantees"" that NATO bar Ukraine from membership and that the western military alliance (which started as a collective security pact against the Soviet Union) pull back its forces from Eastern European member states. But in a ranting speech Monday night, Putin went further, laying out his false pretext for an invasion by questioning Ukraine's legitimacy as a country and even claiming it needed to be liberated from Nazis and pro-Nazi people. Putin also signaled he sees the current democratically elected government in Ukraine as criminal. In addition, Putin used his speech Monday night to lament the end of the Soviet Union and claim that the countries created from Soviet republics weren't really independent. That led President Joe Biden and other world leaders to accuse Putin of trying to reestablish a Soviet empire -- something Putin denied the next day. While it's impossible to see inside Putin's mind, those stated concerns have proven false. On Tuesday, he warned Russia was ready to provide ""military assistance"" to the two Russian-created separatist republics in eastern Ukraine, the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic and Luhansk People's Republic. But his assault on Ukraine hit targets far beyond those tiny separatist areas, where Russian forces have been covertly stationed since 2014. ""This was never about genuine security concerns on their part. It was always about naked aggression, about Putin's desire for empire by any means necessary,"" Biden said Thursday. Who is involved? Russia had been holding huge joint military exercises within Belarus, which shares a border with Ukraine, in the weeks leading up to the invasion -- while scoffing at concerns they would be used for an invasion. On Thursday, Russian and Belarusian forces attacked Ukraine from the north. Other states, including the U.S. and European Union countries, had been attempting to resolve the conflict diplomatically. For weeks, the U.S., NATO, France, Germany, and others engaged in talks with Russia, while threatening heavy sanctions for any invasion and arming Ukraine with defensive lethal weapons. But Biden and other Western leaders have made clear they will not deploy troops to Ukraine to support its military. Still, a U.S. official told ABC News that surrounding nations are worried they will be overwhelmed with refugees fleeing Ukraine. Those surrounding nations include Poland, a NATO ally. The Baltic States -- Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania -- also border Russia to the west and are members of NATO. Should Russia invade any of them, as some fear, the United States has said it will uphold NATO's Article 5, which says an attack on any NATO country is an attack on them all and necessitates a military response. ""The United States, together with our allies, will defend every inch of NATO territory,"" Biden said Tuesday. Biden has deployed thousands of U.S. troops to Europe, including the Baltics, to reassure allies of that promise. What do we know about the separatists? Putin recognized two Moscow-backed rebel regions within eastern Ukraine as independent states. The two self-proclaimed People's Republics of Donetsk and Luhansk want to control the whole of eastern Ukraine's Donbas region, while they only held one-third of it before the Russian invasion. The Russian-controlled separatists claimed they were under attack by Ukraine and were in need of military assistance from Russia ""in repulsing Ukrainian aggression."" Many of these so-called aggressions have been exposed as false flag attacks, and called out as such by the U.S. government and allies. Before pulling out its personnel, the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe's war monitor reported an exponential increase in shelling and other attacks, but made clear it was largely from the separatists' territory. How are the U.S. and its allies responding? Biden announced sanctions against Russian elites and their families and four financial institutions on Thursday, as well as export controls that block key materials like semiconductors for Russia's defense and high-tech industries. Two days earlier, Biden unveiled sanctions on two smaller Russian banks and a first group of oligarchs, warning Putin not to attack or face these harsher punishments -- a threat that was ignored. The U.K. on Thursday announced severe sanctions against more than 100 Russian individuals and entities, including freezing the assets of all major Russian banks and moving to exclude them from the U.K.'s financial system. The European Union also hit Russia with sanctions, including freezing assets. The G-7 countries released a joint statement on Thursday condemning Russia's military aggressions and announcing it will adopt ""severe"" coordinated sanctions. Several members, like Japan and Canada, announced their own, while other nations like South Korea, Australia, and Taiwan have joined, too. The U.S. also sanctioned 24 Belarusian officials, businesspeople, defense agencies and firms, state-owned companies and banks and financial institutions in response to ""Belarus's support for, and facilitation of"" Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the Treasury Department said in a statement. What's at stake? At least 137 people have been killed so far and several hundred have been injured, according to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. As the conflict continues to unfold, many Ukrainians will likely be forced to leave their country en masse, becoming refugees. There also may be large numbers of casualties. Russian troops reportedly took full control of the area around the Chernobyl nuclear power station, including the plant itself, on Thursday, according to Ukraine's prime minister. The zone is about 60 miles north of Kyiv. The destroyed Chernobyl reactor itself is sealed under a giant containment shield, a stadium-sized metal structure that was built over it and completed a few years ago. But the biggest stakes are the rules-based order and general respect for sovereignty in Europe that has helped prevent all-out war for decades, potentially providing a playbook for further land grabs from Putin or other strongmen around the world.",4,,,,26

Biden said in an address Thursday that NATO would meet to ""affirm our solidarity and to map out the next steps we will take to further strengthen all aspects of our NATO alliance."" He also announced escalated sanctions to correspond with the escalated Russian aggression, but not the full economic punishment Ukraine and others have called for and none yet on Putin himself, although he did say that option was ""not a bluff. It's on the table."" ""He has much larger ambitions than Ukraine,"" Biden warned of the Russian leader. ""He wants to, in fact, reestablish the former Soviet Union. That's what this is about. And I think that his ambitions are completely contrary to the place where the rest of the world has arrived."" Pressed on why the U.S. hasn't gone further with sanctions, Biden said that some decisions must be made in unison with European allies -- signaling more sanctions may follow Friday's meeting of NATO's 30 member countries. ""The sanctions that we are proposing on all their banks have the equal consequence, maybe more consequence than SWIFT, number one. Number two, it is always an option but right now that's not the position that the rest of Europe wishes to take,"" Biden said, referring to an international messaging system that allows large financial institutions to send money to each other. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg offered public remarks to open the meeting and was scheduled to hold a news conference at its conclusion, which will be live-streamed on ABC News Live. ""Russia has shattered peace on the European continent,"" he began. ""What we have warned against for months has come to pass, despite all our efforts to find a diplomatic solution. Moscow bears sole responsibility for the deliberate, cold-blooded and long-planned invasion."" Stoltenberg said NATO condemns Russia's aggression ""in the strongest possible terms"" and is calling on Russia to ""immediately cease its military action."" ""We stand with the brave people of Ukraine. We fully support Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity, its right of self-defense, and its right to choose its own path,"" he added. Following the meeting, NATO announced it has activated its NATO Response Force (NRF) because of Ukraine -- a significant development as it's the first time that that the alliance has activated the potentially 40,000 man force for ""a deterrence and defence"" role, according to a NATO spokesperson. ""We are now making significant additional defensive deployments of forces to the eastern part of the Alliance,"" NATO said in a release. The first unit to be deployed will likely be a French and German infantry brigade of 3,500 troops that is always on a heightened state of alert. Then other NATO countries will provide forces, including the U.S. Biden reiterated on Thursday that U.S. troops would not be involved in the fight against Russia in Ukraine, but he did announce that he will deploy more forces to Germany, including some of the 8,500 troops in the U.S. that have been on a ""heightened alert,"" and said he is open to sending additional troops elsewhere in Europe. ""Our forces are not going to Europe to fight in Ukraine but to defend our NATO allies and reassure those allies in the East,"" Biden said. ""As I made crystal clear, the United States will defend every inch of NATO territory with the full force of American power."" Throughout the crisis, Biden has maintained U.S. involvement is about fulfilling a responsibility to defend NATO allies -- and democracy around the world. ""America stands up to bullies,"" Biden said Thursday. ""We stand up for freedom. This is who we are."" ABC News' Luis Martinez contributed to this report.",4,,,,26
2022-02-25,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/International/nato-factors-ukraine-russia-conflict/story?id=83090926,How NATO factors into the Ukraine-Russia conflict,"Ukraine is not a member of NATO, though the international security alliance has been a key player in its ongoing conflict with Russia, which escalated to a full-scale invasion by Russian forces Thursday. Since the United States helped form NATO, or the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, in 1949 to counter Soviet aggression in Europe, the alliance has grown to 30 member countries, including three former Soviet republics -- the Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. In 2008, NATO appeared to open the door to membership to two more former Soviet republics when its heads of government declared that Georgia and Ukraine ""will become members of NATO."" Neither have formally received a pathway to eventual membership, with corruption concerns and a lack of consensus among members seen in part as holding back Ukraine's invitation. Russian President Vladimir Putin has demanded that Ukraine never join the alliance as he seeks to limit NATO’s presence in Eastern Europe. Putin's military operation has prompted NATO allies, worried about further escalation, to issue sanctions meant to impact the Russian economy, bolster troops along the alliance's Eastern flank and repeatedly warn that an attack on one NATO member is an attack on all. In the wake of Russia's attack on Ukraine, President Joe Biden announced that NATO will convene a summit Friday to ""affirm our solidarity and to map out the next steps we will take to further strengthen all aspects of our NATO alliance."" Biden has repeatedly said the U.S. won't be sending troops to engage with Russia in Ukraine, though he has recently authorized the deployment of ground and air forces in Europe to support NATO's eastern flank allies -- Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and Romania -- in response to Russian aggression. Following Thursday's attack on Ukraine, Biden said he has authorized additional forces to deploy to Germany as part of NATO's response. According to a senior Defense Department official, 7,000 service members will be deployed to Germany in the coming days. ""Our forces are not going to Europe to fight in Ukraine but to defend our NATO allies and reassure those allies in the East,"" Biden said during an address Thursday. ""As I made crystal clear, the United States will defend every inch of NATO territory with the full force of American power."" During a video address days before he announced a military operation in Ukraine, Putin linked the current crisis directly to Russia's NATO demands, which include a guarantee that NATO stop expanding to the East and pull back its infrastructure from Eastern European countries that joined after the Cold War. He accused the U.S. and NATO of ignoring Russia's demands and blamed the West for the current crisis in Ukraine. The potential impact of the Ukraine conflict on U.S. interests is considered ""significant,"" by the Council on Foreign Relations, which said in part that the conflict ""risks further deterioration of U.S.-Russia relations and greater escalation if Russia expands its presence in Ukraine or into NATO countries."" ""I think we shouldn't get fixated only on Ukraine,"" Doug Lute, a former U.S. ambassador to NATO and ABC News contributor, told ABC News Live following Putin's speech. ""[Putin's] ambitions beyond that are to essentially rewind the clock 30 years and reverse the progress made in Western Europe, certainly Central and Eastern Europe, and if possible, break the ties between the United States and its European allies."" Were the conflict to go beyond Ukraine and impact NATO members, that could lead the organization to invoke its mutual self-defense clause -- what's known as Article 5 of the NATO treaty, which states that ""an armed attack against one or more of them in Europe or North America shall be considered an attack against them all."" If one ally is attacked, the others will respond with necessary action, including armed force, ""to restore and maintain the security of the North Atlantic area."" The first and only time NATO invoked Article 5 was in response to the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, in support of the U.S. On Thursday, Biden said the U.S. and its NATO allies ""will meet our Article 5 commitments"" if necessary in response to Russian aggression, though they are seeking to deescalate the conflict through increased sanctions. ""If [Putin] did move into NATO countries, we will be involved,"" Biden told reporters. ""The only thing that I am convinced of is -- if we don't stop now, he'll be emboldened. If we don't move against him now with these significant sanctions, he will be emboldened."" U.S. officials see Article 5 as another deterrent for any further Russian aggression. ""Is it a possibility that Putin goes beyond Ukraine? Sure, it's a possibility, but there's something very powerful standing in the way of that -- that's something we call Article 5 of NATO,"" Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in an interview with ABC's David Muir on Thursday. ""The president's been very clear that we will defend every inch of NATO territory. I think that's the most powerful deterrent against President Putin going beyond Ukraine."" One ""gray area"" around NATO's Article 5 response is Russian cyberattacks and their impacts beyond Ukraine, according to U.S. Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.), who oversees the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. ""The real deal is if they suddenly decide to shut down all the power in Ukraine, chances are that may shut down the power in eastern Poland, where American and NATO troops are located,"" Warner told reporters Thursday. ""If they shut down the hospital systems in Poland, and people die because you can't operate, we are suddenly outside of the hypothetical realm of what could constitute what's called an Article 5 violation, where if you attack one NATO nation, you attack all 30 NATO nations. And these hypotheticals become a reality."" If Russia responds to NATO allies' sanctions with cyberattacks, ""we are again going into uncharted territory,"" he said. Last year, NATO said the alliance would consider whether to invoke Article 5 in response to a cyberattack ""on a case-by-case basis."" When asked by ABC White House correspondent MaryAlice Parks on Thursday if the White House thought a cyberattack against a NATO member would trigger an Article 5 response, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said that'd be a ""point of discussion."" ""That, again, is up to the NATO alliance to determine, but obviously a cyberattack does constitute an attack, so that would certainly be a point of discussion among the NATO members,"" she said.

Russia has spent weeks building up military forces near eastern Ukraine, amassing more than 150,000 troops in Belarus and on the Russian side of the border, according to U.S. officials, before it invaded, striking several cities and military bases in Ukraine, including Kyiv, its capital. The Kremlin had repeatedly denied warnings of an invasion before Russian President Vladimir Putin announced his intention to conduct a ""special military operation"" in Ukraine Thursday. Leading up to the invasion, Americans were somewhat mixed on how the U.S. should respond. In a recent poll from Quinnipiac University, 57% of Americans said the U.S. should not send troops into Ukraine if Russia invades, and 54% support Biden's decision to deploy troops to support NATO allies. Last week, as U.S. officials continued to warn about an invasion and the escalating conflict, President Joe Biden addressed the American public and again made clear the U.S. will not send troops to support Ukraine. But he promised to defend ""every inch"" of NATO territory, already deploying several thousand more troops to Europe, and to support the Ukrainian people and their government with lethal defensive weapons, economic aid and crippling U.S. and allied sanctions on Russia. In the wake of the invasion, Biden announced new sanctions on Russian banks. That high level of U.S. involvement is necessary, he said, because ""this is about more than just Russia and Ukraine."" ""It's about standing for what we believe in, for the future that we want for our world, for liberty, the right of countless countries to choose their own destiny, and the right of people to determine their own futures, or the principle that a country can't change its neighbor's borders by force,"" Biden said. ""If we do not stand for freedom where it is at risk today, we'll surely pay a steeper price tomorrow."" To understand the United States' vested interest in the conflict, you'd have to go back to the Cold War, Craig Albert, an associate professor of political science and the director of Intelligence and Security Studies at Augusta University, told ABC News. To counter Soviet aggression in Europe, the U.S. helped form the security alliance NATO, or the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, in 1949. In the years since, NATO has expanded several times, including adding three former Soviet republics. Ukraine, a former Soviet republic that is bordered by Russia on the east, is not a NATO member, though in 2008 the alliance opened the door to membership. Putin has demanded this not happen, as he seeks to limit NATO along Russia's border. ""Ukraine has attached itself to the West, to NATO,"" Albert said. ""They still have military agreements, treaties, economic treaties, business treaties or relationships, even though there's no NATO treaty in place between Ukraine and NATO and the U.S."" One previous agreement is the Budapest Memorandum on Security Assurances, reached between the U.S. and Russia in 1994, under which Ukraine would turn over its nuclear weapons stockpile in exchange for security assurances against threats to its territorial integrity and sovereignty, including seeking ""immediate United Nations Security Council action to provide assistance to Ukraine."" Russia would later flout that agreement when it seized Crimea in 2014. The NATO members bordering Russia also present a concern to U.S. officials. The potential impact of the Ukraine conflict on U.S. interests is considered ""significant,"" by the Council on Foreign Relations, which said in part that the conflict ""risks further deterioration of U.S.-Russia relations and greater escalation if Russia expands its presence in Ukraine or into NATO countries."" As Russia tries to ""reassert itself into the great power game,"" the U.S. is seeking to maintain the balance of power in Europe and ""protect Ukraine as a buffer against Russian-perceived aggression in Europe itself,"" Albert said, noting that Ukraine is ""strategically important"" for Russia, the U.S. and NATO. NATO is ""critical to U.S. policy in Europe,"" and supporting Ukraine for the past 30-plus years ""has been integral to U.S. security policy for the European continent as a whole,"" Matthew Pauly, an associate professor of history at Michigan State University who is an expert on Russia, Ukraine and Eastern Europe, told ABC News. ""There's no doubt that the most eastern-facing NATO member states are quite rightly anxious about Russia's actions in Ukraine,"" Pauly said. ""The United States obviously views it as its duty to oblige by the responsibilities of NATO membership to hold the line on the eastern front of NATO."" Indeed, the U.S. had sent in troops amid the Russian aggression to support NATO's eastern flank. On Thursday, Biden announced he was authorizing additional U.S. force capabilities to deploy to Germany as part of NATO's response force -- including the 8,500 troops put on ""heightened alert"" last month. ""Our forces are not going to Europe to fight in Ukraine but to defend our NATO allies and reassure those allies in the East,"" Biden said during an address Thursday. ""As I made crystal clear, the United States will defend every inch of NATO territory with the full force of American power."" The U.S. has sent thousands of additional troops to Central and Eastern Europe in recent weeks, though Biden made it clear he won't be sending any to Ukraine to fight Russia and had stressed the importance of diplomacy toward achieving de-escalation. In an interview with NBC News anchor Lester Holt earlier this month, Biden acknowledged the risk of further aggression. When asked what scenario could prompt him to send troops to aid Americans in Ukraine, Biden said, ""There's not. That's a world war when Americans and Russia start shooting at one another."" ""We're dealing with one of the largest armies in the world. It's a very different situation, and things could go crazy quickly,"" he said. The risk of the conflict escalating beyond Ukraine is ""high,"" Michael ""Mick"" Patrick Mulroy, ABC News national security and defense analyst, said on ABC News Live last week. ""It should be a concern to everybody,"" he said. Another important dimension to U.S. involvement in the crisis has to do with its support of Ukraine as a democracy, Pauly said. Since 1991, when Ukraine declared its independence, the U.S. has offered ""substantial"" foreign aid, particularly in the 1990s, to help it emerge from the Soviet period, democratize and develop a free market economy, he said. ""Ukraine is a democracy, it's the only really functioning democracy of the few in the former Soviet space,"" Pauly said. ""Although democratization has had sort of a challenging path in Ukraine, it's hard to argue that it is not a democracy."" ""Democracy in Ukraine is worth protecting,"" he continued. ""Democracy is our best guarantee against war and best assurance of peace."" The U.S., along with Western allies, has also voiced support for Ukraine maintaining its sovereignty and territorial integrity against Russian aggression. Biden said the U.S. has been supplying Ukraine's military with arms, training and intelligence to help defend itself. ""Nations have a right to sovereignty and territorial integrity,"" the president said last week. ""They have the freedom to set their own course and choose with whom they will associate."" The exact impact of an invasion beyond the front lines remains unclear. Though Biden warned the American people that there would be ""consequences at home"" -- foremost an increase in energy prices as a result. ""I will not pretend this will be painless,"" Biden said last week. ""There could be impact on our energy prices, so we're taking active steps to alleviate the pressure on our own energy markets and offset rising prices."" In an incursion limited to eastern Ukraine, there could be a rise in the price of oil by $5 or $10 a barrel, according to Patrick De Haan of GasBuddy. Currently, a $1 per barrel rise equates to about a 1.5 cents per gallon rise in the national average price of gas. In response to sanctions, Russia, could retaliate by curbing oil exports, he said, impacting global markets. If higher oil and gas prices cause the Federal Reserve to be more aggressive in its monetary tightening, that could also impact inflation, according to Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody's Analytics. Cyberwarfare also remains a concern. Last month, the Department of Homeland Security warned that the U.S. response to a possible Russian invasion could result in a cyberattack launched against the U.S. by the Russian government or its proxies. Amid increased warnings of a Russian invasion of Ukraine, senior law enforcement and homeland security officials last week urged private industry and state officials to shore up their cyber infrastructure. There's also the impact on American troops, as more military forces are being deployed to support NATO countries. ""I think [Americans] should be paying attention to this because it could significantly affect strategic deployments of U.S. personnel,"" Albert said. ""If nothing else, just people moving from where they are in their typical assignments right now, to move somewhere else, more strategically positioned against, perhaps, a Russian invasion.""

2022-02-23,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/analysis-inside-process-shutting-us-embassy/story?id=83060002,ANALYSIS: How the US government shut down the US Embassy in Ukraine,"Russian President Vladimir Putin has been threatening aggressive action against Ukraine for weeks in an attempt to ensure Russian security. These overtones have increased by the day, forcing the United States and the rest of the world to react and respond to a growing threat to Ukrainian sovereignty, its residents and the tens of thousands of American personnel and citizens living and working in the country. The need to protect American assets and personnel in country has become more necessary, resulting in a Feb. 12 “Do Not Travel” notification, the highest the State Department issues. An order was also issued, mandating the immediate evacuation of almost all government personnel in the country and the closure of the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv. Under any departure circumstance, the Chief of Mission (ambassador) coordinates with the Diplomatic Security Service (DSS) Regional Security officer and the Embassy’s Emergency Action Committee (EAC), which is responsible for planning for and directing emergency responses in times of crisis or during threats against an embassy and/or its personnel. DSS special agents are the most widely deployed American assets throughout the world, protecting over 275 U.S. diplomatic missions in over 170 countries and 30 U.S. cities. These missions include investigation and protection and enable the agents to get involved in all aspects of American foreign policy, from international criminal identification and apprehension of criminals and terrorists to the protection of important U.S. figures and citizens, such as the secretary of state, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations and other senior diplomats. Similar to the recent drawdown of the U.S. Embassy in Kabul, the situation in the Ukraine is forcing the DSS Agents to adapt and respond. In Kabul, the drawdown triggered the immediate evacuation of all staff from the embassy. In Ukraine, the State Department initially ordered an authorized departure, allowing voluntary relocation of families and some staff, and then moved to an ordered departure, the highest level of non-emergency departure for State Department personnel. Like a drawdown, an ordered departure is not voluntary. This departure mandates that all family members and non-essential staff are ordered to depart on evacuation status. Typically, the ambassador will designate the DSS RSO as the incident commander for contingency operations impacting the embassy and its personnel, including during drawdowns or departures. As the Incident Commander, an RSO is empowered and authorized to do all that is necessary to protect people, property, materials and assets located at the embassy or in country. The first step is to secure and destroy all sensitive information and equipment at the embassy, including those used by the intelligence agencies. This includes facilitating the removal of sensitive intelligence or gear deemed of national security significance back to the United States with the use of DSS Diplomatic Couriers. To assist, the RSO is empowered and authorized by law to supervise and direct any and all Department of Defense (DOD) assets to include the Marine Security Guard Detachment. In most cases, when a drawdown or departure is authorized, RSOs will call in a supplemental Marine Security Augmentation Unit (MSAU) which can be a force multiplier during the closure of an embassy. RSOs can also call in additional DSS assets, including elite Mobile Security Deployments (MSD) teams, which is the State Department’s dedicated on-call crisis response tactical element. MSD teams are available to deploy anywhere in the world within 12 hours notice and provide RSOs with supplemental equipment, skills and capability similar to a military Special Operations team. Unlike their DOD counterparts, these MSD teams are exclusively made up of specially selected and trained DSS special agents, not soldiers. While securing the embassy and destroying sensitive information and equipment is critical, the evacuation of Kyiv embassy personnel is also a priority. Depending on the circumstances on the ground, the evacuation of personnel can be facilitated by commercial or DOD assets. In the case of Kabul, DOD assets were used but the sensitivity of the situation in the Ukraine means the RSOs had to coordinate and rely on commercial modes of travel outside of the capital to Lviv or other parts of Eastern Europe. And while the RSOs are handling the evacuation of embassy personnel and the closure of the embassy, the fate of American citizens, an estimated 30,000 in Ukraine, must also be factored into the planning and execution. Under the State Departments’ “No Double Standard” policy, American citizens were warned to leave the country due to the threat. They can leave by commercial means or, if an emergency happens, work with the U.S. Embassy to get out. As the embassy in Kyiv was secured, the last Americans to leave were the DSS agents assigned there. One of their final tasks was to lower the United States flag and ensure the ambassador safely takes it and then secure compound. But even with the embassy closed and flag removed, the State Department has announced this is hopefully a temporary measure, meaning that when the circumstances are right, the embassy building could be reopened. When that happens, the DSS personnel will be the first back in. Donald J.

""He has a number of options available to him and he could attack in short order,"" Austin told Raddatz in an interview conducted in Powidz, Poland, where Austin had come to visit American and Polish troops. Raddatz's full interview with Austin airs Sunday on a special edition of ""This Week"" from Lviv, Ukraine. ""This is not a bluff?"" Raddatz asked Austin about the potential for a Russian invasion. ""I don't believe it's a bluff,"" Austin replied. ""I think it's ... I think he's assembled the right kind -- the kinds of things that you would need to conduct a successful invasion,"" he added. Tensions over the potential for a Russian invasion in Ukraine have increased as American officials have repeatedly said that a Russian invasion could occur ""any day."" Russia's defense ministry claimed this week that it had begun withdrawing tank units and other forces from the area at the conclusion of exercises that had been cited as the reason for the massive troop buildup around Ukraine. But U.S. officials have rejected those claims, saying instead that Russia has continued to flow more troops into the border area while it was claiming a troop withdrawal was taking place. ""He's got things like medical tents and nurses -- you ... would never have seen that if you were going to be withdrawing your troops?"" Raddatz asked Austin. ""Exactly. If they were redeploying to garrison, we wouldn't be seeing the kinds of things in terms of, not only combat power, but also logistical support, medical support, combat aviation that we've seen in the region,"" Austin responded. On Friday, the American representative to the Organization for Security Cooperation in Europe reported to that organization that the U.S. assesses that Russia has ""probably"" amassed between a force numbering between 169,000 and 190,000 near Ukraine's borders, a total that includes Russian separatist forces in eastern Ukraine. The number of Russian separatists forces has not previously been included in estimates of Russian troop levels provided by American officials.",4,,,,1

Answering questions afterward, he appeared to go further than he has before about what Russian President Vladimir Putin might do, saying, ""As of this moment, I am convinced he has made the decision"" to invade. When asked if this means that diplomacy is off the table, Biden said, ""no"" and said until he invades, ""diplomacy is also a possibility."" Pressed why he was confident in his assessment, he responded, ""We have significant intelligence capability."" In his prepared remarks, Biden said, ""We have reason to believe the Russian forces are planning to and intend to attack Ukraine in the coming week -- the coming days. We believe that they will target Ukraine's capitol of Kiev, a city of 2.8 million innocent people. We're calling out Russia's plans loudly and repeatedly not because we want a conflict,"" Biden said, but to prevent them from moving. He made the remarks after he held a call with translatlantic leaders to discuss continued efforts at deterrence and diplomacy and what the White House called ""Russia's buildup of military troops on the border of Ukraine."" He said he spoke with members of Congress attending the Munich Security Conference as well. ""Despite Russia's efforts to divide us at home and abroad, I can affirm that has not happened. The overwhelming message on both calls was one of unity, determination and resolve,"" Biden said. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau participated in the call, along with the leaders of France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Romania, the United Kingdom, the EU, and NATO, according to Trudeau's office. On Friday, the leader of Russian-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine called for his supporters to begin a mass evacuation to Russia, claiming Ukraine was readying for an invasion of the region. Ukraine immediately denied the claim. The Biden administration has repeatedly warned Moscow will likely manufacture Ukrainian provocations to justify an invasion of its smaller neighbor. Putin Friday warned the situation is ""escalating,"" appearing to place blame on Ukraine. ""All Kyiv needs to do is sit down at the negotiating table with representatives of Donbas and agree on political, military, economic and humanitarian measures to end the conflict,"" Putin said Friday during a news conference alongside the leader of Belarus. But Putin continues to demand assurances from the West that Ukraine will never join NATO, a concession U.S. officials are unwilling to make.",4,,,,4
2022-02-17,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/International/tensions-rise-ukraine-russian-backed-separatist-shelling-hits/story?id=82962555,Tensions rise in Ukraine as Russian-backed separatist shelling hits nursery school,"LVIV, Ukraine -- Tensions have jumped in eastern Ukraine as Russian-controlled separatists there shelled a nursery in Ukrainian government-held territory and warned of escalation, amid concerns that Russia may be looking to build a pretext to launch an invasion. Mortar rounds fired by the separatists struck kindergarten number 21 in the village of Stanytsa Luhansk on Thursday morning close to the frontline with Ukrainian troops, injuring three adults, according to Ukraine’s military. Video filmed by Ukrainian soldiers showed a hole blown in the school’s wall. Twenty children had to be evacuated but were unhurt, Ukraine’s armed forces said. Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy accused the Russian-backed separatists of “provocative shelling” and as the United States warned Russia is now preparing to launch an invasion in the coming days. President Joe Biden on Thursday told reporters “every indicator we have is they’re prepared to go into Ukraine, and “we have reason to believe they are engaged in a false flag operation to have an excuse to go in."" NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg also said he was concerned Russia “is trying to stage a pretext for an armed attack against Ukraine.” The firing occurred at the same time as the Russian-controlled separatists accused Ukraine of “large-scale” shelling onto their territory and warned of a “substantial worsening” of the situation along the front line. The self-declared Peoples Republics of Donetsk and Luhansk on Thursday issued “emergency statements” claiming Ukrainian troops had fired onto civilian areas in nine villages, including with heavy caliber mortars. Rodion Miroshnik, a political advisor for the Lugansk ‘republic’, accused Ukraine of ordering a “massive provocation.” The two unrecognized statelets control part of Ukraine’s Donbas regions, after Russia helped create them during fighting in 2014 and they remain heavily dependent on Moscow and its troops, which are covertly stationed there. For weeks, the separatist leadership and Russian state media have accused Ukraine of preparing to mount an offensive against the separatist territories. Western officials and independent experts worry Russia may be laying the groundwork for a pretext it could use to justify a military intervention should it choose to attack. This week, Russia opened a war crimes investigation into separatist claims to have found mass graves, supposedly containing the victims of alleged Ukrainian atrocities. Russian President Vladimir Putin told a press conference on Tuesday “genocide” was taking place in eastern Ukraine. At least 14,000 people have died during the eight-year conflict in Ukraine, many of the victims died following indiscriminate artillery fire by both sides. However, no evidence has emerged of large-scale massacres or genocide as Russia claims. Late Wednesday night, Russia's mission to the United Nations circulated a document that alleged Ukraine had committed large-scale war crimes in the eastern regions ahead of a U.N. Security Council session on the war. U.S. Secretary of State Anthony Blinken in the U.N. council session Thursday accused Russia of planning to manufacture a pretext for an imminent invasion of Ukraine, singling out the mass grave claims and saying Moscow might also stage phony drone strikes or chemical or biological weapons attacks. Russia might try to claim such an event as “ethnic cleansing or a genocide.” Blinken said. He said that would make a “mockery of a concept that we in this chamber do not take lightly.” “Nor do I take lightly, based on my family history,” said Blinken, a reference to his stepfather who survived the Holocaust. Blinken said the U.S.’ information now indicates that Russia’s build up of forces near Ukraine means they “are preparing to launch an attack against Ukraine in the coming days.” He warned that after spreading false claims about a Ukrainian attack on the separatist, Russia might convene high-level emergency meeting to address them, after which it would launch an assault. Blinken said the Russian plan would see aerial bombardment across Ukraine, backed up by massive cyberattacks, as Russian tanks and troops moved on cities, including the capital Kyiv. ""Here today, we are laying it out in great detail with a hope that by sharing what we know with the world, we can influence Russia to abandon the path of war and choose a different path while there's still time,"" Blinken said. Russian officials have dismissed the U.S. accusations as “hysteria” and pointed out that a date announced for the possible Russian attack this week, Feb. 16, had passed without anything materializing. ""We have long ago clarified everything and explained everything, and the announced date of the so-called invasion is behind us, so therefore, my advice to you is not present yourself in an awkward situation,"" Russia’s Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Vershinin told Blinken during the UN council meeting. The Feb. 16 was reported as a possible day for a Russian attack after U.S. officials privately briefed NATO allies last week, but U.S. officials have said the reason they identified it was because of information Putin has ordered his military to be ready to go from that date. Russia’s parliament earlier this week passed a law appealing to Putin to recognize the separatist regions as independent from Ukraine. The step would be a major escalation, opening the path for Russia to formally annex them as it did Crimea in 2014. But Putin so far has signaled he will not act on the appeal, saying on Tuesday that Russia will continue to work through the so-called Minsk agreements. The 2015 peace deal aimed at end the conflict in eastern Ukraine. Russia recognizing the self-declared republics would amount to it exiting the Minsk deal. Russia’s military this week has claimed to be moving some of its forces back from near Ukraine and its Defense Ministry on Thursday insisted again some troops were now returning to base. A spokesman said, the first units from Russia’s western and southern military districts, had already reached their home bases far from the border and more were moving there now. But NATO countries and Ukraine, as well as independent analysts, have said so far there is no evidence of Russia is withdrawing substantial forces and that in reality it is continuing its build up. Huge Russian exercises are continuing in neighboring Belarus and the Black Sea, scheduled to go on until Feb. 20, after which Russia has said its forces will leave. A Russian deputy foreign minister on Thursday said it was time for western countries “to calm down,” saying the exercises would soon end. ABC News' Conor Finnegan contributed to this report.",4,,,,11

""My sense is this will happen in the next several days,"" he told ABC News Chief White House Correspondent Cecilia Vega as he left the White House for a trip to Ohio. Biden told reporters the threat of an invasion is ""very high."" ""They have not moved any of their troops out. They have moved more troops in,"" he said. ""We have reason to believe that they are engaged in a false flag operation, to have an excuse to go in. Every indication we have is they're prepared to go into Ukraine and attack Ukraine."" A senior administration official said Wednesday evening the Kremlin had added about 7,000 troops near the Ukraine border in recent days -- ""with some arriving as recently as today"" -- placing the number of Russian forces near Ukraine above the 150,000 figure cited by Biden in an address to the nation Tuesday. At the same time, Biden repeated there is still a path to diplomacy but said he has no plans to hold a call with Putin. ""That's why I asked Secretary Blinken to go to the U.N. to make his statement today,"" he said, referring to Secretary of State Antony Blinken changing plans at the last minute to address the U.N. Security Council. ""He'll lay out what that path is. I've laid out a path to Putin as well ... There is a path, there is a way through this."" Even as Russia delivered its written response Thursday to U.S. and NATO proposals for talks, a senior administration official dismissed Russia's diplomacy, so far, as disingenuous, to reporters on an earlier call. ""Every indication we have now is that they mean only to pretend to engage in diplomacy, where they publicly offer to talk and make claims about de-escalation -- while privately mobilizing for war,"" the official said. For days now, the Kremlin has claimed to be pulling back Russian forces after completing military ""exercises,"" but U.S. security analysts have said it appears Russian troops are rotating in and growing in number, with the ability to invade Ukraine at any point. Russian leaders, meanwhile, have accused the West of creating ""hysteria"" over the situation at Ukraine's border. The buildup of Russian forces has prompted the biggest concentration of troops in Europe since the Cold War, the NATO secretary-general said Wednesday. Biden warned Putin in remarks from the White House earlier this week that if Russia invades Ukraine, the U.S. is prepared to respond decisively and in unison with NATO allies. ""If Russia attacks Ukraine, it will be met with overwhelming international condemnation,"" Biden said. ""The world will not forget that Russia chose needless death and destruction. Invading Ukraine will prove to be a self-inflicted wound. The United States and our allies and partners will respond decisively. The West is united and galvanized."" Explaining U.S. involvement in the region, Biden told the American people, ""this is about more than just Russia and Ukraine."" ""It's about standing for what we believe in, for the future that we want for our world, for liberty, for liberty, the right of countless countries to choose their own destiny. And the right of people to determine their own futures, or the principle that a country can't change its neighbor's borders by force,"" Biden said.

""Given the very high tensions that we are experiencing, companies of any size and of all sizes would be foolish not to be preparing right now as we speak -- to increase their defenses, to do things like patching, to heighten their alert systems, to be monitoring in real-time their cybersecurity,"" deputy attorney general Lisa Monaco said in remarks at the Munich Cybersecurity Conference. ""They need to be as we say, 'shields up' and to be really on the most heightened level of alert that they can be and taking all necessary precautions."" Monaco said the threat was in no way ""hypothetical,"" citing the devastating NotPetya cyberattack in 2017 that started in Ukraine before spreading globally and causing billions of dollars worth of damage. ""I think cybercriminals need to know that -- and cyber malicious actors need to know -- that attacks on critical infrastructure are unacceptable and will be met with response,"" Monaco said. It comes as various U.S. agencies warned earlier this week of a cyberattack happening at the same time as a potential Russian invasion of Ukraine. On a call with state and local officials on Monday, top cybersecurity officials from the Department of Homeland Security and FBI warned of potential attacks on U.S. cyber infrastructure in concert with a physical invasion of Ukraine, according to a person familiar with the call. Last Friday, DHS explicitly warned of Russian cyber-attack and made a veiled mention at the ongoing geopolitical climate. ""The Russian government has used cyber as a key component of their force projection over the last decade, including previously in Ukraine in the 2015 timeframe,"" the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) warned in an online post. ""The Russian government understands that disabling or destroying critical infrastructure—including power and communications—can augment pressure on a country's government, military and population and accelerate their acceding to Russian objectives."" Ukrainian officials believed they were already the victim of a Russian cyber-attack earlier this year, when suspected Russian hackers defaced Ukrainian government websites, according to officials. Wednesday, the FBI, CISA and the National Security Agency are warned defense contractors of that Russian state sponsored actors continue to attempt and exploit their networks. From 2020 to at least February 2022, Russian state sponsored cyber actors have targeted U.S. cleared defense contractors, according to Wednesday's joint release. The agencies say Russians have targeted various sectors in the defense and intelligence world including intelligence, weapons and missile development and software development. The agencies warn that Russian threat actors use Microsoft 365 to first enter the system and gain official credentials and then send malware to compromise devices without the person knowing. ""Historically, Russian state-sponsored cyber actors have used common but effective tactics to gain access to target networks, including spear phishing, credential harvesting, brute force/password spray techniques, and known vulnerability exploitation against accounts and networks with weak security,"" the joint bulletin says. ""These continued intrusions have enabled the actors to acquire sensitive, unclassified information, as well as CDC-proprietary and export-controlled technology,"" the FBI, NSA and CISA said.",20,,,,5

Ukraine on Wednesday held a nationwide “Unity Day,"" hanging flags and holding ceremonies to sing the nation's anthem on the day that U.S. officials had said a Russian invasion could take place. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy instituted the public holiday in an apparent signal of defiance that also indicated Ukrainian skepticism that an attack would take place. Russian officials, meanwhile, mocked claims that the attack would materialize Wednesday, saying it illustrated Western “hysteria” around Russia’s buildup of troops close to Ukraine. Russia’s military a day earlier said some of its troops have started to withdraw after completing “exercises” and on Wednesday said that process was continuing, releasing new video showing a trainload of armored vehicles rolling across a bridge from Crimea to Russia. But NATO’s secretary general Jens Stoltenberg said that despite the few videos released by Russia, the alliance so far sees no evidence of actual withdrawal and that more troops have continued to arrive. “So far we have not seen any de-escalation on the ground. On the contrary, it appears that Russia continues the military buildup,"" Stoltenberg told reporters before a two-day meeting of NATO’s 30 defense ministers in Brussels. “We are, of course, monitoring very closely what Russia does in and around Ukraine. What we see is that they have increased the number of troops and more troops are on their way and so, so far, no de-escalation,” he said. But Stoltenberg said the alliance still hoped Russia would choose a diplomatic way out of the crisis, noting recent statements from President Vladimir Putin expressing a readiness to engage with the West. “Of course, we hear all the messages about diplomacy and we are ready to engage in diplomatic efforts with Russia,"" Stoltenberg said. Russia’s military said units from its western and southern military districts, that have amassed thousands of troops near Ukraine, have begun returning to their bases. The defense ministry on Wednesday said the western military district units had completed loading their tanks onto transports and were now beginning a “1000 kilometer” journey back to their home base. Russia is continuing to hold huge exercises in neighboring Belarus and in the Black Sea, which are due to run until the end of this week. Western and Ukrainian officials, as well as independent military analysts have expressed skepticism that the announced moves reflect a true pull-back, noting that previously announced withdrawals have amounted to little more than shuffling forces around. U.S. officials also said they have not seen a real withdrawal. ""On the contrary, we continue to see forces, especially forces in the vanguard of any renewed aggression against Ukraine, continuing to be at the border, to mass at the border,"" Secretary of State Anthony Blinken told ABC’s George Stephanopoulos on ""Good Morning America"" Wednesday. Russia has amassed an estimated 150,000 troops on three sides of Ukraine, a presence that includes long-range artillery, advanced aircraft and dozens of attack helicopters. U.S. officials have warned in recent days that some of the troops appear to be moving into ""firing positions"". Satellite photographs from a private company and videos spotted on social media by open source researchers appear to show that for now Russia has continued to move forces closer to the border with Ukraine. A large number of cellphone videos have appeared on TikTok that seem to show convoys of tanks and armored vehicles moving in the Belgorod region that borders Ukraine. The Russian state newspaper Izvestia cited defense ministry sources that the units re-basing were the western district’s 3rd Motor Rifle Division and the southern district's 42nd Guards and 150th Motorized-Rifle Division. But analysts said that the units' home base are located close to Ukraine in any case. The 3rd Motor Rifle Division is based in the town of Boguchar, only about 60 miles from the border. It means the units rather than pulling back from the border are simply moving to a different location along the border. Belarus' foreign minister Vladimir Makey said at a press conference on Wednesday that all Russian troops would leave his country after the joint drills end February 20. U.S. officials continue to believe it is likely Russia will launch a large-scale invasion, potentially as early as this week, although they don't believe Putin has made a final decision yet. ABC News learned that U.S. officials had briefed allies that Wednesday could be the day of the attack because they had information Putin has ordered his military to be ready to go from that day. The U.S. assesses that Russia now has all the necessary forces in place to launch a major attack if Putin chooses. It believes such an attack would not be limited to eastern Ukraine but would target the capital Kyiv, aiming to decapitate the government in a lightning strike planned to be over within 72 hours. The operation would be preceded by large-scale cyber attacks and aerial bombardments against critical infrastructure, before special forces enter Kyiv to target Ukraine's leadership. Russian forces in neighboring Belarus would sweep in from the north, according to the U.S. assessment. A cyber attack hit the website of Ukraine’s defense ministry and two of its largest state banks on Tuesday night. The cyber defense department of Ukraine’s national security service said the DDoS attack was very large, but the damage appeared limited, it said due to preparations Ukraine had taken in recent weeks. After some disruption in online payments, the two banks, Privat Bank and the State Savings Bank, said their systems were working again. The security service said the U.S. was assisting Ukraine in protecting itself against the attack. Ukraine’s government has appeared more skeptical of the invasion risk, with senior officials saying they did not see signs Russia was preparing to attack Wednesday. President Zelenskyy inspected military exercises in the Rivne region near Belarus, wearing army fatigues. In an address filmed selfie-style on his phone earlier Wednesday, he told Ukrainians, “Our shared desire to live unites us, to live together in peace. We are in Ukraine and no one can defend our home like we can.” In Lviv, the largest city in western Ukraine, hundreds of cadets at a local military academy gathered around a towering flag pole on Wednesday morning for a ceremony, where they sang the national anthem, which begins “Ukraine is not dead yet.”",4,,,,11
2022-02-16,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/russian-troops-moved-firing-positions-ukraine-putin-ready/story?id=82909721,"Some Russian troops moved to firing positions near Ukraine, Putin said be ready by Feb. 16: Sources","While Russia's defense ministry said Tuesday that some forces would pull back from Ukraine's borders after completing military exercises, the U.S. has so far not seen that, President Joe Biden said in an address to the nation. But worrying U.S. officials, Russians troops are instead moving forward closer to the line, including with medical supplies, and being put into firing positions, sources told ABC News. The U.S. believes that Russia now has all the necessary pieces in place, including 150,000 troops in the region, to launch a swift and brutal invasion of Ukraine, the sources added -- the reason why Biden administration officials have now publicly been saying Russia could move ""at any time."" In particular, ABC News has learned that Russian leader Vladimir Putin had told his military forces to be ready to go by Wednesday, Feb. 16, but it is still unclear whether he has made a decision to attack his neighbor. The Russian government has denied any plans to invade Ukraine and repeatedly accused the U.S. of ""hysteria"" with these increasingly urgent warnings about one. ""After Russian troops finish drills and return to barracks, the West will declare 'diplomatic victory' by having 'secured' Russian 'de-escalation' -- a predictable scenario and cheap domestic political points,"" Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Saturday, according to the country's foreign ministry. The U.S. believes an invasion would likely begin with electronic warfare and aerial bombardment against critical infrastructure, the sources said, followed by special operations forces entering Kyiv to decapitate the Ukrainian government and resupplying troops entering from Belarus -- with plans to complete their operations in 24 to 72 hours. During his remarks Tuesday, Biden confirmed that Russian troops ""remain very much in a threatening position"" -- warning that an invasion remains ""distinctly possible"" and would inflict an ""enormous"" human toll. But Biden said the U.S. would welcome Moscow pulling back its forces and engaging in diplomatic talks on U.S. and NATO proposals, on issues like arms control and transparency over military exercises. While Lavrov said Moscow's response to those proposals would be transmitted in the coming days, Putin said that Russia's key demands were being ignored -- that Ukraine be barred from joining NATO and that the Western military alliance pull back its forces from Eastern European member states. The U.S. and NATO have said those are nonstarters -- issues that only the alliance itself or individual countries can decide and not under Russian pressure. ""This is about more than just Russia and Ukraine. It's about standing for what we believe in, for the future that we want for our world, for liberty -- for liberty, the right of countless countries to choose their own destiny, and the right of people to determine their own futures, or the principle that a country can't change its neighbor's borders by force,"" Biden said at the White House. Biden and Putin spoke Saturday -- their first conversation in over a month -- while their top diplomats Lavrov and Secretary of State Antony Blinken have spoken twice now in recent days. While the door to continued dialogue remains open, both sides have indicated, there are concerns Russia may resort to war even as it negotiates. Russia already seized Ukrainian territory when it annexed Crimea in 2014, and since then, it has fomented a war against Ukrainian troops by arming and financing separatists in Ukraine's eastern provinces known as Donbas. Russian parliament passed a resolution Tuesday calling on Putin to recognize them as independent republics -- something Putin indicated he would not yet do. But sources said if Russia attacks Ukraine, it would likely not be against a small slice of territory in Donbas, but a bloody, brutal, and swift campaign to topple President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's administration and install a puppet government. Amid the heightened U.S. fears, the U.S. has also been concerned that the Zelenskyy's government hasn't responded quickly enough and isn't better prepared for a potential Russian invasion, sources said, including the positioning of its forces in eastern Ukraine. U.S. officials have been urging better preparedness for two months now, the sources added, but President Zelenskyy and his inner circle have been both intent on staving off a panic and persistent in a belief that Moscow wouldn't invade. While some U.S. officials doubt Putin is bluffing given the costs, financial and political, of the buildup, many analysts have been skeptical of dire U.S. assessments -- with some saying Putin is achieving his ultimate objective: destabilizing an increasingly democratic Ukraine aligned with the West. ""Putin has the hard experience of humiliation in Chechnya that tells him that while Russia might eventually be able to conquer Ukraine, they can’t hold it, and with any crossing of the border they will pay a very high price in blood and treasure,"" said retired Col. Stephen Ganyard, a former senior State Department official and now an ABC News contributor. ""If he fails in Ukraine, it could be his rule that ends as well."" In particular, Ganyard said, a Russian invasion is still facing warm, wet weather conditions that make tank movements and aerial bombardment difficult, while the number of massed Russian troops still pales compared to Ukraine's forces, especially if Russian troops have to occupy a country the size of Texas. Biden made clear the U.S. still hopes for a diplomatic off-ramp and for Putin to decide against invasion, even as they continue to make preparations for one -- from increased military aid for Ukraine, to coordination with European allies and others on sanctions. Since Russia's buildup began, allies and partners have come together quickly to prepare a year's worth of sanctions work in the last six weeks, sources said, including export controls that could devastate Russia's economy. But the U.S. is concerned that Russia could maintain its troop buildup and other ways of pressuring Ukraine short of taking military action -- and that that could start to splinter the Western coalition's unity. Biden made reference to the economic pain that could be felt at home in the U.S., including elevated energy prices because of Russia's major role as an oil and gas exporter. ""But the American people understand that defending democracy and liberty is never without cost,"" Biden said -- adding his administration was taking ""active steps to alleviate the pressure on our own energy markets.""

2022-02-15,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/International/russia-signals-troop-pullback-ukraine-border-exercises/story?id=82896967,Russia says some troops returning to base from Ukraine border,"LVIV, Ukraine -- Russia's military said some troops massed near Ukraine will begin returning to their bases on Tuesday following the completion of what it called ""exercises,"" a potential sign of de-escalation amid continuing fears of a possible Russian invasion. Russia's Ministry of Defense said units from its southern and western military districts, which have deployed thousands of troops close to Ukraine's border, had begun returning to barracks. Video released by the military showed what it said were tanks pulling back and being loaded onto rail transports. A spokesman for Russia's southern military district also said its servicemen had begun leaving Crimea, where Russia has built up a large force. The United States and other western officials, as well as independent experts, expressed caution about the development, saying they would wait to see if Russia really pulled back the troops. Major Russian exercises are continuing in neighboring Belarus to the north of Ukraine and in the Black Sea. NATO's Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said that for now, the alliance had not seen ""any sign of de-escalation on the ground from the Russian side"" but noted there were signs for diplomacy from Moscow that gave grounds for ""cautious optimism."" Ukraine's foreign minister said officials would believe the Russian withdrawal ""when we see it."" Hopes that Russia might be moving to de-escalate tensions were almost immediately dimmed by Russia's parliament, which on Tuesday voted to pass a law calling on President Vladimir Putin to recognize two Russian-controlled breakaway regions of Ukraine as independent. The law appeals to Putin to recognize the self-proclaimed ""People's Republics of Donetsk and Luhansk"" in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine, pro-Russian statelets that were created with Moscow's backing and troops during fighting in 2014. Separatist forces, backed by Russian troops, have continued to fight a low-intensity war with the Ukrainian government. The move to recognize the regions would open a path for Russia to formally annex the regions, as it did Crimea eight years ago. This step would likely trigger more Western sanctions and further escalate the crisis. The vote now puts the decision in Putin's hands. But Putin himself on Tuesday later appeared to suggest he would not move to recognize the regions immediately. At a press conference after meeting with Germany's new chancellor Olaf Scholz, who was visiting Moscow, Putin said that while he believed a ""clear majority"" of Russia supported the step, for now, he believed Russia should continue to work within the existing peace agreement aimed at ending the conflict in Ukraine, the 2015 Minsk agreement. ""I start from that we must do everything for the resolution of the problem of Donbas, but do it first of all starting from the unfulfilled possibilities of the Minsk agreement,"" Putin said. The parliament vote was denounced in Ukraine, with an adviser to President Volodymyr Zelensky calling it an ""escalatory action."" Ukraine's foreign ministry said if Putin did follow through with recognition, Russia would ""de-facto and de-jure exit the Minsk agreements, with all the accompanying consequences."" Putin sent mixed messages during the press conference with Scholz, the latest western leader to visit Moscow to urge a diplomatic exit to the crisis. While Putin acknowledged some Russian troops were withdrawing near the Ukraine border, he signaled he did not consider the crisis to be over, saying Russia was still insisting on its key demands for a guarantee that Ukraine will never join NATO. The U.S. and NATO countries have rejected that as a non-starter but offered to engage with Russia on more modest issues, including limits of missile deployments and military exercises. Putin said he was ready to work with the West of discussing some of those proposed confidence-building measures, including a possible restoration of the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces (INF) treaty that the Trump administration pulled out from. But Putin insisted those discussions could not mean Russia was dropping its central demand on NATO. ""We hear that Ukraine isn't ready today to join NATO and they say that they won't take it tomorrow. And will they take it then when it is ready? Well, for us that might already be too late,"" Putin said. ""And so we want to resolve this question right now. In the nearest future in the course of the negotiating process, with peaceful means,"" Putin said. Asked what the week would bring, Putin didn't rule out the crisis could still escalate, though he repeated Russia does ""not want war."" ""How will Russia act next? According to the plan!"" Putin said that no one knew how the situation would develop but that Russia would strive to come to an agreement diplomatically. Scholz said at the press conference that Russian recognizing the separatist regions would be a ""catastrophe."" He expressed hope that diplomacy can work, but said Russia should take ""clear steps to de-escalate the current tensions"" and warned European Union countries would take ""far-reaching measures"" in the event of Russian ""military aggression"" against Ukraine. The U.S. and other western countries have warned that a Russian invasion of Ukraine could come this week. Before the Russian announcement of the partial withdrawal, satellite images and videos spotted on social media by open source researchers appeared to show Russian forces continuing to move closer to Ukraine, with some units taking up what experts said looked like forward positions. The U.S. on Monday announced it was closing its embassy in Kyiv and moving key diplomats to Lviv in western Ukraine amid an ""accelerated"" buildup by Russian forces. Satellite images published by the private company, Maxar, showed substantial new forces close to Ukraine in Crimea, Belarus and in western Russia, including attack helicopters. Cristo Grozev, a well-known open source researcher, said a team working with the group, Conflict Intelligence Team-- that has been tracking the Russian build up for months-- so far had seen evidence of a Russian withdrawal. ""This may well change in the next hours or days,"" Grozev wrote on Twitter. But for now, he said, the convoys they had been tracking moving towards the Ukraine border ""are still moving in the same direction."" On Tuesday evening, Ukraine said a cyberattack had hit the websites of its military and two of the country's largest state banks. The national cybersecurity center said a DDoS attack had struck the public websites of the ministry of defense and Ukraine's armed forces, causing some disruption to online banking for PrivatBank and the State Saving Bank of Ukraine. Russia's announcement that it was pulling back some forces came a day after Russia's Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu briefed Putin that Russia's huge military drills would end in the ""near future."" Shoigu told Putin that ""part of the drills are approaching their completion and part would be completed in the near future."" Russia has consistently denied it has any intention to attack Ukraine using the more than 100,000 troops it has massed near its border. However, Russia has claimed warnings from the U.S. and other Western countries that it may be preparing to launch an invasion as ""hysteria."" Tuesday ""will go down in history as the day the Western propaganda war failed. Disgraced and destroyed without a shot being fired,"" Maria Zakharova, a spokeswoman for Russia's Foreign Ministry, wrote on her Facebook page Tuesday. Military exercises on an unprecedented scale are continuing in Belarus and are due to end on Feb. 20. The U.S. has warned that Russia could launch an invasion of Ukraine this week, reportedly briefing NATO allies last week that it had intelligence the attack could come on Wednesday. Ukraine's government has expressed more skepticism that Russia is ready to attack this week, suggesting it believes the massive Russian buildup is intended to pressure Ukraine with the threat of invasion. Zelensky, in a televised address Monday night, told Ukrainians he was declaring Wednesday, the alleged day of a possible Russian attack, a national holiday. Zelensky's national security adviser, Oleksiy Danilov, told Ukrainian television Monday night that Ukraine did not see signs Russia is preparing to attack on Feb. 16 or 17. ""We recognize all the risks that there are for our country. But the situation is absolutely under control,"" he said.",4,,,,26
2022-02-15,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/International/us-urges-americans-belarus-part-moldova-leave-now/story?id=82890184,"US urges Americans in Belarus, part of Moldova to leave now amid Russian threat","The State Department has escalated its warning to U.S. citizens in Belarus, where thousands of Russian troops have massed for menacing military exercises -- now urging them to leave the country ""immediately."" The stark new warning comes as U.S. officials fear a possible Russian attack on neighboring Ukraine could unfold in the coming days, prompting the State Department to shutter its embassy facility in the capital Kyiv and relocate them to the western city Lviv. Belarus and Russia launched military exercises Thursday, bringing thousands of Russian troops and advanced weaponry and equipment to the landlocked country that borders both Russia and Ukraine. Its strongman leader, Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko, has drawn increasingly closer to Russian President Vladimir Putin after cracking down on political opposition, fomenting a migrant crisis in Europe and facing tough Western sanctions. The State Department had already urged American citizens ""do not travel to Belarus"" because of that domestic crackdown and the risk of ""arbitrary enforcement of laws"" and detention, as well as COVID-19. But in a new advisory Monday evening, it added a warning about the ""unusual and concerning Russian military buildup along Belarus’ border with Ukraine"" and added, ""U.S. citizens in Belarus should depart immediately via commercial or private means."" The ""situation is unpredictable, and there is heightened tension in the region,"" the advisory states, mirroring the increasingly urgent tone from the U.S. embassy in Ukraine, which urged Americans on Saturday to ""depart immediately"" as well. The warning also noted, ""The U.S. government’s ability to provide routine or emergency services to U.S. citizens in Belarus is already severely limited due to Belarusian government limitations on U.S. Embassy staffing."" The embassy in Minsk, the capital of Belarus, had previously ordered the departure of family members on Jan. 31, with a very small group of U.S. diplomats still in the country. In addition, the State Department is urging Americans to ""depart immediately"" from Transnistria, which is part of Moldova -- the landlocked country on Ukraine's southwestern border. The urgent warning doesn't apply to the entire country, but just to Transnistria, an unrecognized breakaway region where Russia has stationed troops against the Moldovan government's will as ""peacekeepers,"" similar to Russian troops in two disputed regions of Georgia, the small former Soviet republic. Like Belarus, Moldova had been on the State Department's Level 4: ""Do Not Travel"" list because of COVID-19, but now in its new advisory, it warns of the ""unusual and concerning Russian military activity around Ukraine, and the unresolved conflict between the breakaway region of Transnistria and the central government; U.S. citizens in Transnistria should depart immediately."" U.S. officials, including Secretary of State Antony Blinken, have repeatedly referenced Transnistria during the current crisis as another example of Russia's aggression in the region in recent years, along with Georgia and Ukraine. Ukrainian officials went even further last month. Its defense intelligence agency said it had evidence that Russia was planning a false flag provocation against its own soldiers in Transnistria to justify an invasion of Ukraine -- an accusation the Russian government denied. The Biden administration has said it will not use the U.S. military to help evacuate American citizens if war breaks out in the region -- with the memory of Afghanistan hanging over them. That historic, chaotic operation ultimately evacuated some 124,000 people, but the State Department has made clear it was not a precedent. Instead, the U.S. has used increasingly dire warnings to private Americans in Ukraine and now Belarus and Transnistria to leave now while commercial flight options or land border crossings are available.",4,,,,9

The two leaders spoke for just over an hour for the first time since Dec. 30, marking their third conversation amid escalating tensions over Russia's military buildup at the Ukraine border, where it has amassed over 100,000 troops. Biden warned that the U.S. and its allies ""will respond decisively and impose swift and severe costs on Russia"" if it invades Ukraine, according to a brief White House readout of the call. The president also stressed that a Russian invasion of Ukraine ""would produce widespread human suffering and diminish Russia's standing,"" the White House said. ""President Biden was clear with President Putin that while the United States remains prepared to engage in diplomacy, in full coordination with our Allies and partners, we are equally prepared for other scenarios,"" the White House said. Russia has repeatedly denied it has plans to invade Ukraine, despite the buildup on its border. The Kremlin’s top foreign policy aide, Yuri Ushakov, told reporters the call took place in a ‘business-like” manner despite an “atmosphere of unprecedented hysteria” he claimed was being artificially inflated by the U.S. ""The last days, hours, the situation has simply been brought to the point of absurdity,"" Ushakov said. “We have outlined our considerations and stressed several times that we do not understand why deliberately false information about our Russian intentions should be transmitted to the media,"" he continued. A senior administration official did not detail specifics of the call, but told reporters ""there was no fundamental change in the dynamic that has been unfolding now for several weeks."" The official said the countries will continue to ""stay engaged in the days ahead,"" as military action from Russia remains a ""distinct possibility."" ""We are not basing our assessment of this on what the Russians say publicly. We are basing this assessment on what we're seeing on the ground with our own eyes, which is the continued Russian buildup on the border with Ukraine, and no meaningful evidence of de-escalation,"" the official said. The call comes amid ongoing diplomatic efforts Saturday to defuse tensions and avoid war in eastern Europe. On Saturday, France President Emmanuel Macron and Putin spoke at the request of Macron, Russian officials said. The two presidents ""continued their discussion on the conditions for security and stability in Europe,"" Macron's office said in a statement. ""They both expressed a desire to continue the dialogue on these two points,"" the statement continued. French officials said Macron received personal assurances from Putin that he has no intention of attacking Ukraine. Macron raised concerns about Russian naval maneuvers near Ukraine in the Sea of Azov. ""Putin did not present this movement as a precursor to attack,"" French officials said. On Saturday, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and Secretary of State Blinken also spoke. During the 35-minute call, Blinken discussed ""acute and shared concerns that Russia may be considering launching further military aggression against Ukraine in the coming days,"" U.S. officials said. Blinken repeated his refrain that the path of diplomacy remains available -- but if not, the repercussions will be ""resolute, massive and united."" Lavrov accused the U.S. and its allies of a ""propaganda"" campaign and of making attempts to ""sabotage"" the diplomatic talks to resolve the Russian-stoked conflict in eastern Ukraine, Russian officials said. Lavrov denied that Russia has any intention to invade Ukraine, but he also didn't signal that Russia was prepared to deescalate, a senior State Department official told ABC News. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin also spoke with his Russian counterpart, Defense Minister Sergey Shoygu, on Saturday about ""Russia's force build-up in Crimea and around Ukraine,"" the Department of Defense said in a brief readout. The calls come a day after U.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters at the White House that a Russian invasion of Ukraine could begin during the Beijing Winter Olympics, which are scheduled to end on Feb. 20. ""We can't pinpoint the day, at this point, and we can't pinpoint the hour, but what we can say is that there is a credible prospect that a Russian military action would take place even before the end of the Olympics,"" Sullivan said. Following the warning, the State Department said Saturday that all non-emergency U.S. employees would depart the embassy in Kyiv, leaving only a core team of American diplomats and Ukrainian staff members. The department also emphasized that all Americans in Ukraine should leave the country immediately. ""We encourage all American citizens who remain in Ukraine to depart immediately,"" Sullivan said Friday. ""We want to be crystal clear on this point. Any American in Ukraine should leave as soon as possible, and in any event in the next 24 to 48 hours."" The Pentagon also ordered Saturday that a contingent of about 160 members of the Florida Army National Guard training in western Ukraine leave the country. Over a dozen countries have joined the U.S. in telling their citizens in recent days to leave Ukraine. On Saturday, senior U.K. officials said British citizens should get out ""immediately by any means."" The European Union has also begun pulling out non-emergency staff. In Kyiv, Mayor Vitaly Klitschko announced an evacuation plan Saturday and said the Ukrainian capital is preparing in case of a large-scale attack. Russia has also announced it is drawing down its embassy in Ukraine and pulling out some staff because it fears ""provocations"" from Kyiv or other countries, officials said Saturday. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Saturday that the country is ready to counter a possible Russian invasion, but intelligence claims on possible aggression coming next week and the evacuation of foreign diplomats only cause panic. ""Today in the information space, there is too much information about a deep, full-scale invasion from Russia,"" Zelenskyy told reporters. ""The best friend of our enemy is panic in our country, and all that information which helps create only panic doesn't help us."" Russia and Ukraine held talks Thursday in Berlin, moderated by Germany and France, but after nine hours of discussion failed to agree on issuing a joint statement. The sides remained at an impasse over Russia's insistence that the Ukrainian government speak directly with Russian-backed separatist leaders in eastern Ukraine.

The deployment of the additional troops to Poland came as the White House warned that a Russian invasion of Ukraine could begin during the Olympics and urged all American citizens in Ukraine to leave the country over the next 24 to 48 hours. ""At the direction of the President, Secretary Austin today ordered to Poland the remaining 3,000 soldiers of the 82nd Airborne Infantry Brigade Combat Team based at Fort Bragg, N.C.,"" said a senior U.S. defense official. ""These troops will depart Fort Bragg over the next couple of days. They are expected to be in place by early next week."" The additional paratroopers will join the 1,700 soldiers from the same unit who began arriving in Poland earlier this week to help prepare the infrastructure needed if additional American forces were deployed to Poland. Those soldiers were part of a deployment announced last week that included sending 300 soldiers from the 18th Airborne Corps headquarters unit to Germany and sending 1,000 soldiers from the 2nd Stryker Regiment based in Germany to Romania. ""They are being deployed to reassure our NATO allies, deter any potential aggression against NATO's eastern flank, train with host-nation forces, and contribute to a wide range of contingencies,"" said the senior defense official. Those soldiers from the 82nd Airborne have been arriving at an airport in southeast Poland located 60 miles form the border with Ukraine. A U.S. official has told ABC News that these troops would be prepared to provide assistance to any American citizens fleeing Ukraine by land. ""These additional deployments are temporary in nature, meant to supplement for a brief time the more than 80,000 U.S. troops already in Europe on rotational and permanent orders,"" said the senior defense official. The 3,000 troops now headed to Poland were not among the 8,500 troops based in the United States who had been put on ""heightened alert"" two weeks ago in case they needed to be deployed on short notice as part of the NATO Response Force. Additional U.S. aircraft and accompanying personnel already in Europe have moved closer to NATO's eastern flank as tensions have grown in recent days. Eight American F-15 fighter jets along with about 130 troops with the 493 Fighter Squadron based in the United Kingdom arrived in Poland Thursday. ""The extra fighters will bolster readiness and Allied deterrence and defense as Russia continues military build-up in and around Ukraine,"" a statement from U.S. Air Forces in Europe and Air Forces Africa said. Another squadron of Air Force F-16 fighters based in Germany arrived in Romania on Friday. Additional naval power has also been sent to the European region, with four U.S.-based destroyers deployed to ""participate in a range of maritime activities in support of the U.S. Sixth Fleet and our NATO allies,"" according to the U.S. Navy. While not confirming the deployment of the four ships is directly tied to tensions with Russia, a Navy official noted that they destroyers bring options to the region. ""One of the unique values of naval forces is their mobility and ability to deploy for a range of contingencies and operations,"" the official said. ""These deployments provide additional flexibility to the Sixth Fleet Commander.""",4,,,,6
2022-02-10,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/International/russia-begins-huge-war-games-belarus-amid-ukraine/story?id=82799211,Russia begins huge war games in Belarus amid Ukraine invasion fears,"KYIV -- Russia has officially kicked off the main phase of huge joint military exercises in Belarus, as Western countries continue to warn Russian forces massed near Ukraine could be used to launch a possible attack. Russia has poured an unprecedented number of troops and equipment into Belarus over recent weeks ahead of the 10-day drills, moving units almost 6,000 miles from its far east and deploying tanks, long-range artillery and advanced fighter jets. The United States and NATO countries have expressed worries that the exercises could be used as a cover for preparations for a possible on Ukraine, whose capital, Kyiv, is less than 200 miles south. But Russia and Belarus have insisted the drills are just defensive war games. Russia’s defense ministry on Thursday said the exercises, called ""Union Resolve 2022,"" will “practice averting and repelling external aggression via a defensive operation, as well as combating terrorism and defending the interests” of Russia and Belarus. The exercises are due to end on Feb. 20 and the Kremlin has said its troops will leave Belarus then. Russia’s deployment of troops to Belarus is part of its broader military buildup massing over 100,000 troops along Ukraine’s eastern border and to the south in Crimea. Independent military analysts have sounded the alarm over the exercises, saying the scale of the Russian deployment is vastly larger than anything since the Cold War and includes units that would be used in a major invasion, such as advanced anti-air defences and Iskander-M long-range missile brigades. Satellite imagery has shown some of the Russian units are parked only a few dozen miles from Ukraine’s border, in areas not officially designated for the exercise. The Belarus drills will coincide with what Western countries and some analysts have said is the window when Russia will reach the point of readiness to launch a major military operation against Ukraine. NATO’s Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg on Thursday warned “the number of Russian forces is going up. The warning time for a possible attack is going down."" “We must be prepared for the worst while remaining strongly committed to finding a political solution,"" Stoltenberg added. Ukrainian officials are much more skeptical and have denied the Russian forces in Belarus appear ready to launch an offensive. Defense Minister Oleksiy Reznikov this week said Ukraine did not see Russia forming any strike groups in Belarus and that it had insufficient forces, he estimated only several thousand. Ukraine's government has said it believes the Russian buildup right now is primarily aimed at putting psychological pressure on Ukraine with the threat of attack. In the next 10 days Russia will make a vast display of military power to the north, east and south of Ukraine, holding exercises on an unprecedented scale also outside Belarus. The period seems likely to be a key moment in determining whether the crisis escalates or if the Russian buildup turns to a bluff. The exercises in Belarus will also overlap with large-scale Russian naval drills in the Black Sea, that on Thursday prompted Ukraine to accuse Moscow of mounting an “unprecedented” naval blockade of Ukrainian ports. Six Russian warships, including amphibious landing ships, entered the Black Sea Wednesday night, to join a fleet already there. Ukraine said it “strongly protests” against the live-fire drills between Feb. 13 and Feb. 19 that are expected to close off access to much of its coast in the Black Sea and to the Sea of Azov. If President Vladimir Putin is preparing to attack, the Russian build up appears to be approaching a point of maximum danger, according to some analysts, who say it has nearly completed its build up of heavy equipment and is now entering a phase where it will move up personnel to man it. That does not mean that Russia will attack — U.S. officials say they believe Putin has not yet made a decision — just that it will have the forces in place to do so within the next two weeks. “Once the second phase of the exercise begins on the 10th, I think they’re going to have everything they need in place and I think that week or the week after would make the most sense for an escalation if Russia is planning on doing an escalation,” Rob Lee, an analyst at Kings College London’s War Studies department, told ABC News. An analysis by Janes, the defense think tank, estimated there are at least 14 Russian battalion tactical groups in Belarus with around 8,000 to 14,000 troops. The U.S. has said it assesses as many as 30,000 could take part. “Best case scenario at the end of the exercise they start moving that equipment out,"" Lee said. But as long as that equipment is still there then the risk is going to be very high of an escalation."" Lee said he believed a military incursion was more likely than not. The Kremlin has denied it has any invasion plans, dismissing it as Western “hysteria."" After meeting the U.K.’s foreign minister in Moscow on Thursday, Russia’s Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov mocked Western allegations Russia was preparing to attack, including claims it might be waiting for the ground to freeze to allow tank movements. “It’s like when they say that Russia is waiting for the ground to freeze so that tanks can easily enter Ukraine,” he added. “It seems that our British colleagues were on similar ground today, off of which bounced all the facts we presented them.” Key talks are taking place in Berlin Thursday aimed at continuing diplomatic efforts to de-escalate the crisis. Ukraine and Russia will meet at the so-called ""Normandy Format,"" the long-running negotiations, mediated by France and Germany, aimed at resolving the conflict between Ukraine and Russian-backed separatists in its east. No breakthrough is expected, but Western countries are hoping the talks can build on the small positive signs for diplomacy that emerged from French President Emmanuel Macron’s meeting with Putin in Moscow at the start of this week.",4,,,,11
2022-02-09,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/International/ukraine-russia-hold-key-talks-crisis-berlin/story?id=82781870,"Ukraine, Russia to hold key talks on crisis in Berlin","KYIV -- A new round of key talks aimed at de-escalating the Ukraine crisis is set to take place in Berlin on Thursday. The talks will follow the so-called Normandy Format, the name of the long-running negotiations between Russia and Ukraine, mediated by France and Germany, and are aimed at ending the conflict between Ukraine and Russian-backed separatists in the country's east. The talks have been largely deadlocked since 2015, but Thursday's meeting is being closely watched for signs that a flurry of diplomatic activity this week, spear-headed by French President Emmanuel Macron, might point toward a broader de-escalation of the growing crisis. Macron visited Kyiv Tuesday to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy following marathon talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow that resulted in a glimmer of hope that Putin may be open to taking Western offers of diplomacy to end the crisis. Macron has said Putin assured him there would be no escalation around Ukraine, and French officials have since said they believe the visit has achieved a ""pause"" that allows de-escalation and gives more time for negotiations. With Russia continuing to move troops close to Ukraine, where it has already massed over 100,000, the hope expressed by Macron and Zelenskyy is that Thursday's talks can widen that diplomatic path and help bring down tensions. In Kyiv, both leaders spoke optimistically about Thursday's talks, saying they expected progress. The talks will be held between Ukraine's lead negotiator, Zelenskyy's top aide Andriy Yermak, and Dmitry Kozak, a deputy chief of staff to Putin. No breakthrough or even substantial progress is expected, but Western countries and Ukraine are pushing to reinvigorate the format to try to get Russia to engage or at least keep diplomacy going for now. Macron has said the talks should provide a ""clarification"" of what's possible. Macron has said making progress in the Ukraine talks should be combined with the launching of a separate dialogue with Russia on European security to address Kremlin concerns about NATO. It is still not clear if Macron's initiative means the Kremlin is ready to take a diplomatic exit. But it's hoped some positive steps at the talks could reduce the risk of military escalation. ""Unless Russia is serious about de-escalation, I think buying time is all we can hope for,"" a former adviser to Zelenskyy told ABC News. Russia's buildup has already reinvigorated the talks -- a round held in Paris two weeks ago was the first in two years and ended with the sides recommitting to a much-violated ceasefire. The Normandy talks are intended to negotiate the fulfillment of the so-called Minsk agreement, a peace deal that ended large-scale fighting in 2015, but which has been effectively stillborn since. The deal envisages Ukraine regaining control over the eastern separatist Donbas regions in return for granting them broad autonomy in its constitution. The talks have been deadlocked because Russia and Ukraine disagree over the order the agreement should be fulfilled. Russia demands that Ukraine first change its constitution to give the Russian-occupied regions special autonomous status and hold elections in them before it regains any control there. Ukraine says the separatists must disarm and Russian forces there leave before any elections to decide the regions' statuses can be held. Russia has pushed for Ukraine to reintegrate the separatist regions because it would give it a lever in Ukraine's government, and a de facto veto on Ukraine joining NATO or the European Union. For that reason, accepting the Minsk agreement on Russia's terms has become politically impossible for any Ukrainian government, which would face huge backlash at home. Most experts believe Russia is massing troops near Ukraine in part to try to force Kyiv into moving toward Moscow's interpretation of the Minsk agreement. But Ukraine's government has feared that in the face of the Russian military threat, Western countries might force it to make concessions. In Ukraine, there was media speculation Wednesday that Macron may have pressured Zelenskyy to make concessions in Thursday's talks, in particular to begin direct negotiations with the Russian-controlled separatists, the self-proclaimed People's Republics of Donetsk and Luhansk (DNR and LNR). If true, that would be politically explosive in Ukraine and would mean Macron had pushed Zelenskyy into a major concession. But Ukraine's foreign minister on Wednesday bluntly denied it would ever hold direct negotiations with the separatists. The minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said France understands Ukraine's ""red lines and do not demand to implement things that are not acceptable to Ukraine."" Kyiv refuses to negotiate with the separatist because it sees them as puppet governments controlled by Russia. Talking to the rebels directly would accord them recognition and also legitimize the Kremlin's false claim that the conflict in Ukraine is a civil war, in which Russia is not involved. Macron's office also denied it had pressured Ukraine. French officials said Thursday's talks would focus on how Ukraine can move toward introducing a draft law granting special status for the separatist areas and get comments on it from the separatists as an exception set out by the Minsk agreements. ""We are basically preparing to be able to put on the table all the practical options which will ultimately have to receive the approval not only of the Ukrainians, but of the Russians,"" the officials said. Oleksiy Semeniy, a former adviser to Ukraine's national security council and currently director of the Institute for Global Transformations in Kyiv, told ABC News on Wednesday he did not believe it was politically possible for Zelenskyy to start direct negotiations with the separatists. He said an important sign of success would be if it was announced following the talks that a leaders summit, involving Zelenskyy and Putin, would take place.",4,,,,26
2022-02-08,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/International/france-putin-promised-military-initiatives-ukraine-talks-macron/story?id=82741612,France says Putin promised no 'new military initiatives' near Ukraine in talks with Macron,"KYIV -- France's President Emmanuel Macron said on Tuesday Russian President Vladimir Putin had assured him there would be no ""escalation or deterioration"" of the crisis around Ukraine, as French officials said there were signs Putin was moving towards de-escalation. Macron said he obtained the assurances during the five hours of talks he held with Putin in the Kremlin in Moscow on Monday night. Following the talks, French officials said Putin had committed to not launch any new ""military initiatives"" and promised the thousands of Russian troops massed in Belarus to the north of Ukraine would leave after exercises ended there this month. Macron flew to Kyiv on Tuesday to meet with Ukraine's president Volodymyr Zelenskyy, where during a joint press conference afterwards he said Putin had told him he would ""not be the instigator of any escalation."" He said ""no one was naive"" but that he believed some progress had been made. “For me it was about arranging things to prevent an escalation and open up new avenues ... and that objective for me has been fulfilled,” Macron told reporters on the plane flying to Kyiv, according to AFP. If true, the commitment not to launch new military action could be an important sign may be closer to taking Western diplomatic offers as a road out of the crisis, where the Russian build up near Ukraine has sparked fears of invasion. But the Kremlin on Tuesday downplayed the French comments, denying that any deal had been reached. Spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that the Financial Times, which first reported the French claims, had “simply written incorrectly"" and that it was impossible for Putin and Macron to reach a deal since France was not the leader of NATO, which would need to accept any agreement. Peskov said Western countries for now were still ignoring Russia's key demands for security guarantees that Ukraine never join NATO, saying while grateful for Macron's efforts, “for now, of course, we can’t say we sense any real path to a resolution.” But Peskov did confirm the promise Russian troops will leave Belarus once the joint exercises there end on Feb. 20. “No one has ever said that Russian troops will remain on the territory of Belarus, that has never been a question,” Peskov told reporters. “On the conclusion of these exercises the troops will return to their place of permanent deployment."" Russia has been pouring trainloads of troops into Belarus amid its broader build up near Ukraine, alarming Western countries which fear they could be used as a cover for an attack. But Moscow and Minsk both insist the troops are there just for war games. Putin and Macron’s marathon talks in the Kremlin Monday had ended with a glimmer of hope the Russian leader is ready to accept diplomacy. Putin afterwards told a press conference that Macron had brought “a range of ideas,"" which he said it was too early to talk about publicly, but that Putin said he considered “possible as the basis for our next steps.” It was not clear what those ideas were. But French officials afterwards said Putin and Macron had agreed to “the initiation of a broader dialogue” on three key points: first, Russia’s military posture and second, the long-running ‘Normandy Format’ negotiations aimed at ending the conflict in Ukraine between government and Russian-backed separatists in the east. Third, the “opening of a dialogue on strategic issues,” a phrase that refers to troop and weapon deployments, and wider questions of NATO’s relationship with Moscow. Ukraine's Zelenskyy on Tuesday was also more sceptical of Putin's assurances, saying at the press conference with Macron: ""I do not really trust words, I believe that every politician can be transparent by taking concrete steps"". Russia has denied it has any plans to attack Ukraine, calling the Western accusations hysteria. But it has continued to build up troops near to Ukraine, with more forces arriving in recent days and, according to open source researchers, some appearing to move closer to the border. While massing troops near Ukraine, the Kremlin has demanded the United States and NATO give a binding guarantees on NATO membership and that the alliance pull back its infrastructure from eastern European countries that joined after the Cold War. The U.S. and NATO countries, including France, have rejected those as non-starters, but have offered to engage with the Kremlin on more modest security issues, including limits on missile deployments and troop exercises. Macron in front of Zelenskyy again affirmed NATO’s so-called ""Open Doors"" policy. Any diplomatic breakthrough would either have to find a creative way of reassuring the Kremlin on its main demands or for Putin to move back from them. Macron and Zelenskyy both denied a report that Macron had raised the idea of so-called 'Finlandization' as a possible solution. The term refers to Finland's neutral status during the Cold War where it remained outside NATO in return for the Soviet Union largely recognising its independence. Macron denied using the phrase or raising the concept with Putin, despite news reports he had told journalists it was one option ""on the table."" Zelenskyy said this was the first time he had heard of the idea and that he would never suggest ""Ukraine-izing"" other countries. Both men emphasised the importance of talks planned this Thursday in the so-called 'Normandy' group, that is mediated by France and Germany to try to end Ukraine's conflict with Russian-backed separatists in the country. The talks seek to unblock efforts to implement the 'Minsk agreement', which ended large-scale fighting in 2015 between Ukraine's government and the Russian-controlled rebels but has been largely deadlocked since. It is not clear how that has changed, but Macron and Zelenskyy both spoke positively about Thursday's talks, saying they hoped they would make progress. Zelenskyy said he hoped the talks would move the possibility of a full-scale summit between the leaders of the four countries closer. After meeting with Zelenskyy, Macron flew onto Berlin to meet with Germany's leader Olaf Scholz, who has just returned from Washington, where he met with President Joe Biden on Monday and discussed the crisis. Macron and Scholz afterwards said their ""common goal is to prevent war in Europe"" and Scholz, who has been criticised as being too reluctant to threaten painful sanctions on Russia if it attacks, said they were united in preparing to respond. ""Our appraisal of the situation is united, as is our position on this: Any further attack on the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine is unacceptable and will draw wide-reaching consequences for Russia -- politically, economically and geo-strategically,"" Scholz said.",4,,,,26
2022-02-06,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wh-national-security-adviser-distinct-possibility-russian-attack/story?id=82694548,WH national security adviser says there's a 'very distinct' possibility of Russian attack on Ukraine,"As the standoff between Russia and the United States continues, White House National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan warned of a ""very distinct"" possibility Russia will attack Ukraine at ""any time now."" ""We believe that there is a very distinct possibility that Vladimir Putin will order an attack on Ukraine. It could take a number of different forms. It could happen as soon as tomorrow or it could take some weeks yet,"" Sullivan said in an interview with ABC ""This Week"" Co-Anchor Martha Raddatz on Sunday. ""[Putin] has put himself in a position with military deployments, to be able to act aggressively against Ukraine at any time now,"" he added, stressing that the United State is working with allies and continues to urge a path of diplomacy. Sullivan said the United States is ready to respond, no matter what Russia decides. ""If they choose to go down the path of escalation instead, it will come at enormous human cost to Ukrainians. But it will also, we believe, over time, come at real strategic cost to Vladimir Putin,"" he said. ABC News has learned Putin now has 70% of his troops in place to possibly launch a full-scale attack on Ukraine. The report comes as U.S. troops began arriving in Poland over the weekend after President Joe Biden ordered deployments to reassure NATO allies. Raddatz pressed Sullivan on the message U.S. troop deployments sends to the Russians as the U.S. continues to push for a diplomatic solution: ""You talk about this diplomatic path, but 1,700 US troops just arrived in Poland, part of the 3,000 going in. Three hundred more sent to Germany. ... (It) sounds like you're no longer trying to de-escalate the situation."" ""We have since the beginning for months now, as we have warned about the possibility of a Russian invasion of Ukraine, pursued a two-track approach, deterrence and diplomacy,"" he argued. ""Those forces you just referred to have not been sent to fight Russian forces in Ukraine. They have been sent to defend NATO territory because we have a sacred obligation under Article 5 to defend our NATO allies and to send a clear message to Russia, that if it tries to take any military action or aggression against our NATO allies, it will be met with a stiff response, including by the U.S. forces who are on the ground there now,"" Sullivan said, adding the U.S. has been ""equally clear"" it is ready to have ""substantive discussions on matters of European security"" with Russia. Sullivan would not get into specifics on how certain an attack is, even though Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., reportedly said after a briefing on the situation that a Russian invasion was a ""near certainty."" ""I'm not going to make a prediction about what is going to unfold in the coming days. All I'm going to say is that we, the United States, under the direction of President Biden, are ready either way,"" Sullivan said when pressed by Raddatz. ""We are ready,"" he said, adding, ""And we are ready to respond in a united, swift and severe way with our allies and partners should he choose to move forward with a military escalation."" As the window for diplomacy appears to be rapidly closing, U.S. officials have repeatedly said they do not believe Putin has made up his mind on how to proceed but no longer describe the threat of a possible invasion as ""imminent,"" White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Wednesday. With athletes from around the world gathering to compete in the Winter Olympics in China, Raddatz asked Sullivan if the U.S. believed Putin would hold off on an attack until the games conclude on Feb. 20 -- allowing more time for the ground to freeze to facilitate tank movements. Sullivan said it was possible but stressed that an attack could also come sooner. ""At this point, we're in the window, meaning that we can't just assume it's going to be a couple of weeks off. Is that a possible scenario? Are there reasons to believe that it could happen in that timeframe? Yes. But there are also reasons to believe that Russia, under the direction of President Putin, could take steps before then."" Sullivan appeared to brush off concerns over China's alliance with Russia and the impact it could have on the U.S. threat of sanctions after Putin and President Xi Jinping met in Beijing Friday. ""That is an economic power powerhouse, China. Could that undermine your plans for severe sanctions?"" Raddatz asked. ""Our view is that China is not in a position to compensate Russia for the economic losses that would come from our sanctions. That's the analysis that we and the European share, and we believe the Russians and Chinese understand that as well,"" Sullivan responded, adding that China would also feel the cost in the ""eyes of the world"" of supporting Russia.",4,,,,26
2022-02-03,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/us-russia-planning-video-fake-ukrainian-attack-corpses/story?id=82651966,"US says Russia planning video of fake Ukrainian attack with corpses, mourners to justify invasion","The United States said Thursday it had intelligence that showed Russia is planning to create a video depicting a fake Ukrainian attack, that it could release in order to justify its own invasion of Ukraine. One of a number of options Russia has been allegedly planning, U.S. officials said, was to ""stage a fake attack"" against Russia or Russian-speaking people. ""As part of this fake attack, we believe that Russia would produce a very graphic propaganda video, which would include corpses, and actors that would be depicting mourners, and images of destroyed locations as well as military equipment,"" Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said. The United States took the rare step of making this intelligence public in order to dissuade Russia from moving forward or, if it did move forward, to make it more difficult for it to spread disinformation after the fact, according to Jon Finer, the principal deputy U.S. national security adviser. ""We don't know definitively that this is the route they're going to take,"" Finer said in an interview with MSNBC. ""But we know that this is an option under consideration,"" he continued, ""that would involve, you know, actors playing mourners for people who are killed in an event that they would have created themselves, that would involve the deployment of corpses to represent bodies purportedly killed in -- people reportedly killed in an incident like this."" The U.K. said later Wednesday that it had conducted its ""own analysis of the intelligence,"" and that it had ""high confidence that Russia is planning to engineer a pretext blaming Ukraine in order to justify a Russian incursion."" “This is clear and shocking evidence of Russia’s unprovoked aggression and underhand activity to destabilize Ukraine,"" Britain's foreign secretary, Liz Truss, said. It is not the first time in recent weeks that the United States had accused Russia of ""fabricating a pretext"" to justify invading Ukraine. The Kremlin on Wednesday dismissed the new allegations. ""This is not the first such promise,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said, according to the Russian state news agency TASS ""Earlier, similar things were also voiced. But nothing ever occurs."" Last month, the White House said the U.S. had intelligence that Russia had prepositioned a group of operatives in eastern Ukraine in order to create a ""false-flag operation"" there. The administration said the group was trained in urban warfare and the use of explosives. A spokesperson for the White House's National Security Council declined to say whether those the United States is accusing of being involved in creating a fake video were part of this same group. The U.S. believes Russia has already recruited the people who’d be involved with the fake ""attack"" video and that “Russian intelligence is intimately involved in this effort,"" according to the senior administration official. The U.S. thinks that “the military equipment used in this fabricated attack will be made to look like it is Ukrainian or from allied nations” – and that it was “possible” that Bayraktar drones, which Ukraine has, would be used to make it look like Ukraine carried out the attack, according to the official. U.S. officials have repeatedly said, as recently as Wednesday, that they do not believe Russia's President Vladimir Putin had yet decided whether to invade Ukraine. But if he did want to move forward, the senior administration official said, one trigger could be Russia recognizing separatist regions in Ukraine as independent, rather than as part of Ukraine. Russia's parliament is advancing legislation that would do so. The U.S. believes that if Russia formally recognized the regions as independent, Russia could then release the video showing a fake Ukrainian ""attack"" – that it could portray as in response to the independence recognition – or Russia could just invade without releasing the video, according to another administration official. “In line with its previous interventions, Russia would portray its actions as defending ethnic Russians and coming at the request of a sovereign government for assistance,"" the senior administration official said.

2022-02-02,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/biden-orders-us-troop-deployments-reassure-nato-allies/story?id=82622507,Biden orders US troop deployments to reassure NATO allies amid Russia standoff,"President Joe Biden has ordered U.S. troop deployments to reassure NATO allies amid the standoff with Russia over Ukraine. Pentagon press secretary John Kirby announced the imminent arrival of several thousand U.S. troops -- some already in Europe and some from the U.S. -- to NATO allies in eastern Europe at a Pentagon briefing Wednesday -- the first major movement of U.S. forces in response to concerns Russia will invade Ukraine. ""President Biden has been clear that the United States will respond to the growing threat to Europe's security and stability. Our commitment to NATO Article 5 and collective defense remains ironclad. As part of this commitment and to be prepared for a range of contingencies, the United States will soon move additional forces to Romania, Poland, and Germany,"" Kirby said. All of the troops would be under U.S. command. In a brief exchange with reporters Wednesday afternoon, President Joe Biden said the move was “totally consistent with what I told Putin in the beginning."" ""As long as he is acting aggressively,"" Biden said, ""we're going to make sure we can reassure our NATO allies and Eastern Europe that we're there and Article Five is a sacred obligation.” Russia called the deployments “destructive.” ""Destructive steps that are unjustified by anyone, they increase military tension and narrow the room for political decisions,” Russia’s deputy foreign minister, Alexander Grushko, said, according to the Russian news agency Interfax. The White House said the deployments were not in response to any specific, recent event. ""I would not read this as a decision made based on any events over the last 48 hours or a couple of days,"" White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Wednesday. ""We've been in discussion and under discussion with our partners and allies in the region where these troops are going for several weeks now.” Psaki said the United States was aiming to reassure allies, deter Russia and ""ensure we are ready for every contingency."" Kirby said he wanted to ""be very clear"" that ""these are not permanent moves."" ""They are moved designed to respond to the current security environment. Moreover, these forces are not going to fight in Ukraine. They are going to ensure the robust defense of our NATO allies,"" he said. A senior defense official had earlier confirmed to ABC News that about 3,000 U.S. troops will be given orders to deploy to Europe or, if they're already in Europe, to head to countries in eastern Europe. One of the units moving into eastern Europe from Germany is a fast-moving armored Stryker unit. ""It's important that we send a strong signal to Mr. Putin and frankly, to the world that NATO matters to the United States. It matters to our allies, and we have ironclad Article 5 commitments attack on one is an attack on all,"" Kirby said. The troop movements are separate from the 8,500 U.S. troops put on ""heightened alert"" to reinforce NATO's Response Force if needed -- and none would go to Ukraine. Pressed on what signal it sends that the U.S. is not waiting for a NATO vote to deploy an alliance force, Kirby said ""the signal that sends -- that we're that we're moving additional U.S. forces into allied territory, at the request and with the invitation of those countries -- is that we take our NATO commitments very, very seriously."" Kirby said 1,000 soldiers based in Germany will arrive in Romania in ""the coming days"" at the request of the country, augmenting the roughly 900 U.S. troops already in Romania. Another 2,000 troops from Fort Bragg in North Carolina will deploy to Europe, with 1,700 heading to Germany and about 300 to Poland, the White House said. ""The 82nd Airborne Division is deploying components of an Infantry Brigade Combat Team and key enablers to Poland. And the 18th Airborne Corps is moving a joint task force capable headquarters to Germany. Both of them, as you know, are based in Fort Bragg, North Carolina,"" Kirby said. The Pentagon spokesperson said that these moves could be ""preliminary,"" meaning more troops could be sent. He added that the 1,000 troops heading to Romania will be joining the country's own ""very capable"" military, and will also be joined by an unspecified number of French troops. Asked why the deployment is coming now, Kirby blamed Russian President Vladimir Putin who, he said, ""continues to add forces -- combined arms, offensive capabilities even over just the last 24 hours."" ""He has showed no signs of being interested or willing to de-escalate the tensions,"" Kirby said of the Russian leader. After last week saying the U.S. thought a Russian invasion was “imminent,” Psaki said Wednesday she no longer would use that word. Ukrainian officials had publicly disputed the fact that a Russian attack was “imminent” and even criticized the Biden administration for how it was describing the threat. A better way to describe the White House’s view about what Putin may do, Psaki said Wednesday, was that “he could invade at any time.” The U.S. still believes Putin has not made a decision about how to proceed, she said. Kirby emphasized the Biden administration does not believe conflict is inevitable. The announcement comes after Biden told reporters on Friday that he would be moving American forces ""in the near term."" Putin blamed the escalating tensions on the U.S. and the West for having ""ignored"" Russia's key demand that NATO bar Ukraine from joining the organization. The U.S. and NATO allies argue Russia is the aggressor, having already invaded Crimea and massing troops at the border. ABC News' Ben Gittleson and Max Karmen contributed reporting.",4,,,,26
2022-02-01,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/International/us-russia-agree-talking-amid-ukraine-crisis-putin/story?id=82600066,"US, Russia agree to keep talking amid Ukraine crisis but Putin claims concerns 'ignored'","The U.S. and Russia are moving ahead with their diplomatic engagements over Russia menacing Ukraine, according to senior State Department officials, after the two countries' top diplomats spoke Tuesday. But as talks continue, there have been no results yet -- with more than 100,000 Russian troops still massed on Ukraine's borders, including increasingly in its northern neighbor Belarus. Russian leader Vladimir Putin said the U.S. has ""ignored"" Russia's key demands that NATO bar Ukraine from joining and pull back allied troops from Eastern European countries -- his first comments on the crisis in over a month. But his government is still analyzing the U.S. response to Russia, laid out in a formal proposal hand-delivered by the U.S. ambassador in Moscow last week, he said. During a critical call Tuesday, Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov ""did agree that the ideas on both sides that have been exchanged did form the basis for the potential for serious discussion on a range of issues,"" said a senior State Department official. Those ideas include issues like arms control and greater transparency in military exercises, they added, expressing some hope that Russia's continued engagement could lay the groundwork for real negotiations. But for now, Russia is still formulating its response to those U.S. ideas, Lavrov said he told Blinken, calling those issues ""important in their own way, but secondary"" to Russia's key demands. Putin dug into NATO on Tuesday during a press conference with Viktor Orbán, the autocratic prime minister of NATO member Hungary. ""We have been promised by NATO that it will not advance its infrastructure one inch further eastwards. Everybody knows that. Today, we see where NATO is -- Poland, Romania, the Baltic States. They said one thing and did another thing. As the people say, they played us -- simply lied. OK, that's fine,"" the Russian leader said. U.S. officials have said that the U.S. and NATO never made promises not to expand eastward and that joining the Western military alliance is the decision of any individual country and NATO. But Putin for years has decried the alliance as threatening Moscow, even as Russia has invaded Ukraine and Georgia, illegitimately stationed troops in Moldova and conducted cyberattacks against the U.S., United Kingdom and others. He also accused Ukraine, ""fully packed of weapons,"" of seeking to join NATO to start a conflict with Russia over Crimea with NATO's backing. Crimea is the Ukrainian peninsula that Russia seized in 2014 -- a land grab the international community has not recognized -- as Russian forces fomented a conflict in Ukraine's eastern provinces known as Donbas. That's exactly the pretext for a renewed Russian attack on Ukraine that U.S. officials have said they're concerned Moscow is preparing. The heightened rhetoric from Putin was largely dismissed by the Biden administration Tuesday, with State Department spokesperson Ned Price saying, ""I will leave it to the Kremlinologists out there -- budding professional, amateur, or otherwise -- to read the tea leaves and try to interpret the significance of those remarks. For our part, we don't necessarily need to do that because we know that a formal response from the Russian Federation is forthcoming."" When that response is finalized, it will be sent to Putin for approval and then set to the U.S., the senior State Department officials said, and after that, Blinken and Lavrov plan to speak again. Pressed on whether the Russians may be buying time or stalling before a renewed attack on Ukraine, a second senior State Department official said, ""Because we don't President Putin has made a decision [on whether to further invade Ukraine], we think it's important to keep the diplomatic option on the table -- so to the extent that Russia wants to engage in that diplomatic track, we are also open to having that continued diplomatic engagement."" Blinken and Lavrov didn't agree on when or how those talks would continue, but the U.S. has called for them to include one-on-one meetings, as well as negotiations between NATO and Russia and dialogue at the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, a Cold War-era forum that includes the U.S., Russia, and Ukraine. On Monday, Moscow sent the U.S., as well as all OSCE members and several NATO allies, a similar letter seeking clarification about security principles enshrined in one of the OSCE's key documents, the Helsinki Final Act, according to U.S. and Russian officials. The letter was not Russia's response to the U.S. proposal, but seems to be part of its effort to formulate one. ""NATO refers to the right of countries to choose freely, but you can not strengthen someone's security at the expense of others,"" Putin said Tuesday during his press conference. ""This is a topic that we will not allow to be covered up. We will insist on a frank conversation and a frank explanation as to why the West doesn't want to fulfill its obligations or it wants to fulfil them selectively in its own favor,"" Lavrov added during an appearance after his call with Blinken. The U.S. has previously made clear it believes that Ukraine has a right to choose its own alliances and that the smaller, democratic country poses no threat to Russia's security. As the U.S. and NATO wait for that formal Russian response, Blinken again urged Russia to deescalate tensions by pulling back troops, heavy weaponry, and equipment from Ukraine's borders. But Lavrov gave no indication during the call that Russia would do so, the senior State Department officials said. ""All of the actions that we are seeing on the ground do not suggest escalation. We continue to see in fact more Russian troops coming not only to Russia's border with Ukraine, but as you know, also to Belarus for these supposed exercises,"" the second senior State Department official said. Russia and Belarus have said those forces are preparing for military exercises to improve their readiness. But the U.S. said Monday it has evidence that more than 30,000 Russian troops will mass in Belarus in the coming days, citing declassified U.S. intelligence -- a concerning move that puts them within two hours of Ukraine's capital Kyiv.",4,,,,9

The meeting didn't yield any action or even a joint statement, but ambassadors from the U.S. and Russia sparred in dueling remarks, trading blame for escalating the crisis. Russian leader Vladimir Putin has amassed over 100,000 troops and heavy equipment and weaponry on three sides of Ukraine, including in Russian-annexed Crimea and in Belarus, Kyiv's northern neighbor and a close Kremlin ally. At first, Russia, backed by China, tried to block the session from moving forward by calling a vote among Security Council's 15 member states. Russia and China opposed it, three countries abstained, but ten voted to move ahead with it. ""You heard from our Russian colleagues that we're calling for this meeting to make you all feel uncomfortable. Imagine how uncomfortable you would be if you had 100,000 troops sitting on your border in the way that these troops are sitting on the border with Ukraine,"" said U.S. ambassador to the U.N. Linda Thomas-Greenfield. ""This is not about antics. It's not about rhetoric. It's not about 'U.S. and Russia.' What this is about is the peace and security of one of our member states."" In her remarks, Thomas-Greenfield accused Russia of ""the largest -- hear me clearly -- mobilization of troops in Europe in decades"" and threatening military action should its concerns about Ukraine joining NATO and NATO's troop deployments in Eastern European member states not be addressed. ""If Russia further invades Ukraine, none of us will be able to say we didn't see it coming, and the consequences will be horrific,"" she added. But Russia's envoy again denied that the Kremlin is planning to attack its neighbor, a former Soviet state and now a growing democracy -- telling the Security Council there is ""no proof confirming such a serious accusation whatsoever,"" defending troop movements within Russia's borders as a domestic issue, and then denying there are 100,000 as U.S. and other Western officials have said. ""They themselves are whipping up tensions and rhetoric and are provoking escalation,"" Russian Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia said of the U.S. and its NATO allies. ""The discussions about a threat of war is provocative in and of itself. You are almost calling for this. You want it to happen. You're waiting for it to happen."" Thomas-Greenfield requested to speak again to respond, saying, ""I cannot let the false equivalency go unchecked, so I feel I must respond. ... The threats of aggression on the border of Ukraine -- yes on its border -- is provocative. Our recognition of the facts on the ground is not provocative."" Ukraine -- which is not a member of the Security Council, but was invited to participate -- urged Russia to respect its ""sovereign right"" to choose which countries it partners with. ""Ukraine will not bow to threats aimed at weakening Ukraine, undermining its economic and financial stability, and inciting public frustration. This will not happen. And the Kremlin must remember that Ukraine is ready to defend itself,"" Ukrainian Ambassador Sergiy Kyslytsya told the council. In a sign of their increasing alignment, China was the only country to back Russia's effort to squash the public meeting. Its ambassador Zhang Jun said they oppose ""microphone diplomacy of public confrontation"" and believed the open discussion of the issue would add ""fuel to the tension."" While the session didn't yield any results, it marks the start of another week of diplomacy between Russia and the U.S. and its allies over Ukraine. ""Russia heard clearly a united position from the vast majority of the council, and I hope that that will lead to a diplomatic solution,"" Thomas-Greenfield, a member of President Joe Biden's Cabinet, told reporters after the meeting. Biden himself hailed the meeting as ""a critical step in rallying the world to speak out in one voice: rejecting the use of force, calling for military de-escalation, supporting diplomacy as the best path forward."" On Tuesday, Secretary of State Antony Blinken will speak with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, the State Department and Russian Foreign Ministry confirmed Monday -- the first conversation after the U.S. responding in writing last week to Russia's demands about Ukraine and NATO. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is expected to speak to Putin this week, days after the U.K. said it could deploy troops to protect NATO allies if Russia invaded Ukraine. Biden announced a similar position last week, putting 8,500 U.S. troops on ""heightened alert"" and adding Friday he could do so in the ""near"" future. In a potential positive sign for diplomacy, Russia said some of its forces had pulled back from the border areas after a ""preparedness check,"" according to the Russian Armed Forces' Southern Military District. But it's not yet clear if the U.S. had confirmed any troops were withdrawn from the border region, and Thomas-Greenfield warned the U.S. has evidence Russia intends to expand its presence in Belarus to more than 30,000 troops -- putting them less than two hours north of Kyiv. Those deployments include short-range ballistic missiles, special forces, and anti-aircraft batteries, she added -- all of which Russia and Belarus have said are for military exercises.

On six separate occasions between 2014 and 2017, authorities say Allison Fluke-Ekren, 42, allegedly expressed interest in carrying out terrorist attacks in the United States in support of ISIS, the foreign terrorist organization that's based in Iraq, Syria and other locations in Africa and the Middle East. Fluke-Ekren moved to Syria in 2012 and married a ""prominent"" ISIS leader, court documents said. She can reportedly speak four languages, and the documents alleged she rose up the ranks to command her own battalion. ""Fluke-Ekren's main objective in this role was to teach the women of ISIS how to defend themselves against ISIS' enemies,"" the complaint stated. ""There are American citizens who want to do damage to our country and whether they're here inside the country, trying to commit attacks or outside of the country,"" Tony Mattivi, the former DOJ National Security Coordinator for the District of Kansas said. She also allegedly housed, translated for and trained women to fire automatic weapons, the Justice Department said. ""Recent charges brought against Allison Fluke-Ekren demonstrate the appeal ISIS had to a broad section of foreign extremists around the world, including women and those from the United States,"" said Javed Ali, former senior counterterrorism director at the National Security Council and a professor at the University of Michigan's Ford School of Public Policy. ""Despite their similar jihadist outlooks, unlike al Qaida, ISIS held little to no prohibitions for more operational roles for women in the group, and there were many other women who performed similar functions in ISIS like Fluke-Ekren,"" Ali told ABC News. Among the attacks she was interested in carrying out were ideas to bomb a mall and a college in the U.S. ""To conduct the attack, Fluke-Ekren explained that she could go to a shopping mall in the United States, park a vehicle full of explosives in the basement or parking garage level of the structure, and detonate the explosives in the vehicle with a cellphone triggering device, "" she allegedly told a witness, according to court documents. Fluke-Ekren also allegedly once presented an FBI informant with a plan ""targeting a U.S.-based college."" She ""stated that they would dress like infidels and drop off a backpack with explosives,"" court documents said. She also ""fantasized"" about committing an attack where there was a large amount of people, the documents stated. ""Fluke-Ekren considered any attack that did not kill a large number of individuals to be a waste of resources,"" they said. The documents against Fluke-Ekren were filed in 2019. She was arrested in Syria and is expected to make her first federal court appearance in Alexandria, Virginia, on Monday, when she will be appointed an attorney.",20,,,,18
2022-01-28,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/pentagon-russian-forces-move-ukraines-cities/story?id=82534587,Pentagon says enough Russian forces to move on Ukraine's cities,"The nation's top defense officials, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley said Friday that Russia now has amassed enough military forces to move on Ukraine, possibly even its largest cities. Both leaders urged Moscow to seek a peaceful resolution to the crisis with Ukraine and reassured NATO allies that the U.S. was ready to help reinforce NATO nations bordering Ukraine. Austin told reporters that Russian military forces have ""progressed at a consistent and steady pace"" for months as the Kremlin has deployed forces to Crimea and along Ukraine's border, including in Belarus. ""We don't believe that President Putin has made a final decision to use these forces against Ukraine. He clearly now has that capability, and there are multiple options available to him,"" Austin said. ""Including the seizure of cities and significant territories"" or ""provocative political acts like the recognition of breakaway territories."" Milley, the nation's highest-ranking military officer, said the Russian government has amassed more than ""100,000 ground forces, air forces, naval forces, special forces, cyber, electronic warfare, command and control, logistics, engineers and other capabilities along the Ukraine border."" Asked if this threat feels different from years past, Miley said, ""This is larger than anything in scale and scope in the massing of forces than anything we've seen in recent memory."" Milley added that given the array of forces and the amount of firepower the Russian military has amassed a Russian invasion would be catastrophic for Ukraine, causing ""a significant amount of casualties."" ""You can imagine what that might look like in dense urban areas, along roads and so on and so forth. It would be horrific. It would be terrible,"" he said. ""And it's not necessary, and we think a diplomatic outcome is the way to go here."" With 8,500 U.S. troops in the U.S. on ""heightened alert"" this week to head to the region, Austin said, ""If NATO activates its Response Force, these troops will be ready to go."" ""Putting our forces on a shorter string enables us to get there in a shorter period of time,"" said Austin. He explained that the decision to announce the heightened alert status reflected the focus ""on making sure we're ready to live up to our commitment to NATO. ""Conflict is not inevitable. There is still time and space for diplomacy,"" Austin continued. ""The United States, in lockstep with our allies and partners, has offered Russia a path away from crisis and toward greater security in the Department of Defense will continue to support those diplomatic efforts."" ""We're focused on reassuring our allies and that's what this is all about,"" said Austin. ""In terms of trusting Putin, I don't think this is about trusting Putin. This is about our allies trusting us."" He also said the U.S. remains committed to sending financial security assistance to Ukraine and holding a united front with NATO allies. ""As we've made clear, in addition to the significant economic and diplomatic costs that Russia will incur, a move on Ukraine will accomplish the very thing Russia says it does not want a NATO Alliance strengthened and resolved on its western flank,"" Austin said. ""The United States will contribute to NATO's response forces, and we will coordinate with our NATO allies, and we will make sure that they have the capabilities that they need to defend themselves."" Asked what it would take for him to trust Russian President Vladimir Putin, Austin said it's not about trusting Putin but ""about our allies trusting us -- and so that's really what we're focused on."" The White House said President Joe Biden had a call with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Thursday, to ""reaffirm our support for Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity,"" after the U.S. hand-delivered its diplomatic response to Russia's security demands and refused to agree to its central request that Ukraine never be allowed into NATO. At a press briefing Friday morning from Moscow, Ambassador John Sullivan, who delivered that U.S. response Thursday, reiterated that any further incursion to Ukraine would be met with massive economic sanctions. Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, in a press conference with Russian media on Friday, countered that the Kremlin will take retaliatory measures unless a guaranteed security agreement is reached with the West. ""If our attempt at reaching an agreement on mutually acceptable principles of the provision of European security fails, we will resort to retaliatory measures,"" Lavrov said. Later on Friday, French President Emmanuel Macron was scheduled to speak directly with Putin as world leaders engage in finding a diplomatic solution. While White House press secretary Jen Psaki repeated on Thursday the Biden administration's belief that an invasion of Ukraine could ""come at any time"" as Russian troops continue military exercises in a show of force, officials in Ukraine have urged their people not to panic. While it's unclear if Russia if or when Russia may actually invade, some have speculated an offensive could be timed with the upcoming Winter Olympics in Beijing as Russia has used both winter and summer Olympic Games in the past as cover to launch military action.",4,,,,26
2022-01-27,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/us-nato-military-moves-send-message-russia-ukraine/story?id=82462943,"US, NATO using military moves to send message to Russia over Ukraine","Wednesday's arrival of American F-15 fighters in Estonia to join an ongoing NATO air policing mission over the Baltics would normally not garner much attention were it not for the rising tensions of a possible Russian invasion of Ukraine. While the F-15's weeklong deployment to Estonia to join fighter jets from Belgium had been in the works for a while, Thursday's arrival in Lithuania of four Danish F-16 fighters for a similar mission was a more recent decision by Denmark tied to the rising tensions over Ukraine. Though small in scope, Denmark's deployment of the additional aircraft and a ship to the Baltic Sea sends a message to Russia about the willingness by NATO countries to demonstrate their military capabilities and commitment to NATO partners during a crisis. The deployments also highlight NATO's existing presence in eastern Europe and the Baltics, prompted by Russia's 2014 invasion of Crimea, and how any military movements are being viewed through the prism of the crisis with Ukraine, no matter the size of the deployment. Since Ukraine is not a member of NATO, the alliance has no security commitment to Ukraine should Russia invade, but it is intent on assuring the security of neighboring NATO countries. On Wednesday, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said that while diplomatic efforts continue to try to defuse the crisis with Russia ""we are also prepared for the worst."" Stoltenberg also said this week's announcement by the Pentagon that 8,500 troops in the United States had been placed on heightened alert demonstrated ""demonstrates the strength of the NATO alliance."" On Monday, the Pentagon announced that most of the troops had been placed on shortened ""prepare to deploy orders"" in case they were needed for the 40,000 man NATO Response Force was activated on short notice to respond to a crisis. . That same day Stoltenberg had detailed the movement of small numbers of ships, airplanes, and troops by Denmark and other NATO countries to eastern Europe and the Baltics. Ironically, it was Russia's 2014 takeover of Crimea that prompted NATO and the U.S. to initially rotate more robust military forces into eastern Europe and the Baltics. That includes Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland where in recent years NATO has positioned four battlegroups consisting of 4,000 multinational troops, including American forces. Separately Russia's annexation of Crimea led the United States to establish high-profile troop rotations in eastern Europe, currently there are 5,000 American forces carrying out training Poland. Both the U.S. and NATO have been very public with any new or potential military call-ups or deployments to message to Russia that the alliance remains strong and has the capability of quickly reinforcing member nations that request assistance. That messaging can include disclosing military planning and procedures that are not normally made public. The Pentagon's top spokesman acknowledged on Tuesday that publicly announcing that 8,500 American military on heightened alert and on shorter ""prepare to deploy orders"" was not customary for the U.S. military. ""It's not typical that we talk about it as much as we've been talking about it,"" John Kirby told reporters. Kirby also noted that the 8,500 troops on alert have not received orders to deploy and that the thousands of American troops already stationed in Europe were more likely to initially resource the NATO Response Force should it be activated. The public messaging about military readiness is in line with the very public warnings to Russia by President Biden and American allies that a Russian invasion of Ukraine would have severe economic consequences for Russia. ""Although ""strategic ambiguity"" is an essential part of our international diplomacy, in this case, Russia needed to have a strong and unified message from the U.S. and NATO,"" said Mick Mulroy a former deputy assistant of defense and an ABC News national security contributor. ""The Pentagon has also been very forthcoming on all its activities,"" he said. ""This is likely in an attempt to avoid any misinterpretation of their actions."" Mulroy that Russia should do the same particularly with more than 100,000 ground troops on Ukraine's borders. ""Without constant communication, this situation could lead to a conflict in which every nation involved, and even those that are not, is negatively impacted,"" he said.",4,,,,26

""It is my view that deficiencies in the current classification system undermine our national security, as well as critical democratic objectives, by impeding our ability to share information in a timely manner, be that sharing with our intelligence partners, our oversight bodies, or, when appropriate, with the general public,"" she writes in a letter dated Jan. 5 and sent to Sens. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., and Jerry Moran, R-Kan. The classification system, she wrote, reduces the intelligence communities capacity to ""effectively support senior policy maker decision making, and further erodes the basic trust our citizens have in their government."" The challenge on how to protect national security information, but appropriately share it is not a new challenge, nor is it easy, she said. The senators wrote the Haines in October to express concern about the current classification system, noting numerous reviews of the process have ""documented concerns across the entire lifecycle of the current system."" ""In the meantime, the volume of classified material produced continues to grow exponentially in a digital first environment, bringing with it the expanding burden of mandatory declassification requirements,"" Haines said. Haines said there are already efforts currently underway, but those were not disclosed in the letter obtained by ABC News. She says the issue of classification is also ""great importance"" to President Biden. The letter was first reported by the Wall Street Journal.",20,,,,17
2022-01-26,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/russia-diplomacy-ukraine-ball-court-blinken/story?id=82485448,Russia maybe 'not serious' about diplomacy on Ukraine but ball in its court: Blinken,"Secretary of State Antony Blinken, speaking at the State Department on Wednesday, confirmed the U.S. had delivered a written response to Moscow security demands as Russia amassed troops on its borders with Ukraine. ""Today, Ambassador Sullivan delivered our written response in Moscow. All told, it sets out a serious diplomatic path forward, should Russia choose it,"" Blinken said. ""The document we’ve delivered includes concerns of the United States and our allies and partners about Russia's actions that undermine security, a principled and pragmatic evaluation of the concerns that Russia has raised, and our own proposals for areas where we may be able to find common ground,"" he continued. ""This is not a negotiating document,"" Blinken said, adding that President Joe Biden was ""involved from the get-go"" and had signed off on it. ""The ball is their court,"" he added, referring to the Russians. Russia had said it would not continue talks until Moscow had the responses in hand, and Blinken announced after meeting in Geneva last week with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov that the U.S. would oblige, which some argued might be seen as a U.S. concession. But Blinken denied that, saying the U.S. did not change its positions in the paper, but ""reiterated what we said publicly for many weeks and, in a sense, for many, many years."" That includes rejecting Russia's key demands, laid out in its own draft treaties last month, that NATO bar Ukraine from joining the Western military alliance and that NATO pull back troops from its Eastern European member states, who were formerly Soviet states. ""There is no change. There will be no change,"" he told reporters. ""I can't be more clear -- NATO's door is open, remains open, and that is our commitment."" Blinken and Lavrov will speak in the coming days once Russia has reviewed the U.S. response, the top U.S. diplomat said. While there are fears that Russia is using the diplomatic exchange as pretext to attack Ukraine, saying diplomacy failed to address their concerns, Blinken said the U.S. would not be the one to end talks, even as it prepares sanctions and readies NATO deployments. ""You may be right, that Russia is not serious about this at all. But we have an obligation to test that proposition, to pursue the diplomatic path,"" he said. ""The point is we're prepared either way."" Blinken's comments follow Biden saying Tuesday there could be some U.S. troop movements in the ""nearer term"" -- and that he would consider personally sanctioning Russian President Vladimir Putin if Russia invades Ukraine -- a day after 8,500 American forces were put on ""heightened alert"" in the region. But in Ukraine, leaders have offered a different assessment from that put forward by the White House that a full-scale Russian attack is imminent. During a news conference on Wednesday, Ukraine Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said they believe Russia’s forces are currently “insufficient” for a full-scale invasion and that right now the Kremlin is seeking to destabilize Ukraine with the threat of attack and other means, not yet actually launching one. In a televised address to the nation Tuesday night, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy urged people to stay calm about the threat of a Russian attack and said there was work in progress to bring about a meeting between him and the leaders of Russia, France and Germany. ""Protect your body from viruses, your brain from lies, your heart from panic,” Zelenskiy said. The White House and State Department have defended the administration's decisions and rhetoric, denying that drawing down the embassy, putting 8,500 U.S. troops on alert, and warning of an ""imminent"" threat have escalated the situation. Asked on Tuesday about the criticism from Kyiv that the U.S. is giving into Russia's playbook, State Department Spokesperson Ned Price denied the U.S. created a ""panic."" ""We have been clear about our concerns. We have been clear about the depth of those concerns,"" Price said. ""Given what we're seeing on Ukraine's borders, what we're seeing in what should be an independent sovereign country of Belarus, with the Russian military buildup there, what we're seeing with preparations for potential hybrid operations -- all of this is cause for concern, but certainly no one is calling for panic.""",4,,,,9

Kristina Kvien, the embassy's charge d'affairs, made the remarks after standing in the bitter cold with a Ukrainian deputy defense minister to receive a 79-ton delivery of American military aid at Kyiv's Boryspil Airport, intended to help Ukraine defend itself against Russia. The U.S. State Department on Sunday ordered diplomats' families to leave and authorized non-emergency staff to depart if they choose, in light of the threat of a possible Russian invasion, as Moscow masses over 100,000 troops near Ukraine's borders. Ukraine's government has criticized the decision, calling it ""premature"" and ""excessively cautious."" The United Kingdom, Canada, Australia and Germany have since followed suit in various forms, but the majority of European countries have said so far they do not believe such a step is warranted. Kvien told ABC News the decision on the partial evacuation was taken out of an ""abundance of caution"" given the scale of the Russian build up. ""The decision was made because right now Vladimir Putin and Russia have built up such military might on the border that they could take an action any day now,"" she said. ""And with that in mind, we felt that out of an abundance of caution, we had to make sure that our embassy families were safe. So that was the basis for a decision."" Kvien said Russia had built up so many troops it ""means that Russia could do anything at any moment."" ""It's like a gun to the head of Ukraine,"" she said. ""And we don't think that Ukraine should have to live with a loaded gun to its head."" Ukrainian officials have publicly disagreed with the U.S. assessment that a Russian attack could take place at any moment. A deputy defense minister, Hanna Malyar, on Tuesday said the number of Russian troops at the border currently is ""not enough for a full-scale invasion."" In general, Ukrainian officials are more skeptical that Russia will really go through with a major attack and in recent days they have become increasingly vocal in contesting the picture coming from the U.S. that an attack is imminent. The head of Ukraine's national security council, Alexey Danilov, on Monday told the BBC that ""the number of Russian troops is not increasing in the way many people are presenting it"". Ukrainian officials instead have suggested they believe Russia's build up is currently intended to destabilize Ukraine with the threat of attack, including by undermining its economy. Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in video addresses has urged Ukrainians not to panic and that the threat of invasion is not worse now than when Russia began the conflict in 2014. Kvien said she believed Ukraine's government views the threat seriously. ""I do think that President Zelenskyy is taking the threat very seriously, and he is being careful to make preparations as needed,"" she said. ""They've been living with Russian threats for a long time. So I would say that they are just a bit more, 'sang froid' as they say, in French. But that doesn't mean that they don't take them seriously,"" she said. The U.S. military aid shipment landing on Tuesday was the third to arrive in a week, part of a $200 million security aid package approved to help Ukraine defend itself and deter Russia. The delivery included 276 Javelin anti-tank missiles, over 800 SMAW-D shoulder-fired ""bunker buster"" missiles, 170, 000 rounds of 50-caliber ammunition, as well as bomb disposal suits. Kvien said the weapons demonstrated the U.S.' ""absolute, rock-solid support"" for Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity. The U.S. is still seeking to avert a Russian attack through diplomacy. Russia has demanded guarantees from the U.S. that Ukraine will never join NATO and that the alliance will pull back forces from eastern European countries that joined after the Cold War. The U.S. has already ruled that out but has proposed discussing other security issues, such as limits on missiles deployments and military exercises. Kvien repeated there are ""some areas"" that the U.S. is able to talk about with Russia to try to address its concerns, such as ""arms control, better transparency in terms of military exercises,"" but she reiterated that Ukraine's choice to try to join NATO was not on the table. She said she hoped Putin would choose to take the path of diplomacy. ""I think that it's the only reasonable path. I think it's the only path that ultimately will lead to a more secure Europe, which Mr. Putin says he would like to have,"" she said. Correction: An earlier version of this article misstated the quantity of 50-caliber ammunition in the U.S. military aid shipment that arrived Tuesday. It was 170,000 rounds not 170 pounds.",4,,,,26

From President Volodymyr Zelenskyy down, the Ukrainian government has tried to urge calm, with senior officials making clear in recent days they don't see the risks now as any more heightened than over the last eight years of Russian-stoked conflict in eastern Ukraine. Ukrainian Deputy Defense Minister Hanna Malyar, for example, said the number of Russian troops massed on Ukraine's borders ""are not enough for a full-scale invasion."" Instead, Russian leader Vladimir Putin is using the troop build-up ""primarily to politically blackmail the West and pressure Ukraine,"" she wrote in a Facebook post. ""Russia's tactical goal is provoke integral divisions in our society, sow fear and panic, to destabilize the internal situation,"" she added. Ukrainian concern that fear and panic could spread, sending Ukraine's economy spiraling or creating political turmoil, has started to create divisions between the U.S. and Ukraine -- despite efforts on both sides to make clear they stand united against any Russian aggression. ""All is under control. There are no reasons to panic,"" Zelenskyy said in a televised address to his country Monday night -- but the speech spent more time on COVID-19 than Russia. Some of the steps the U.S. has taken in recent days, some in Kyiv fear, are playing into Moscow's playbook -- stoking fear and panic. That includes the State Department's decision to draw down the U.S. embassy, ordering diplomats' families to evacuate and authorizing non-emergency staff to depart if they choose. State Department spokesperson Ned Price called it a ""prudent precaution,"" but his Ukrainian counterpart, Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Oleg Nikolenko criticized it as ""a premature one and an instance of excessive caution."" ""The Russian Federation is currently taking active efforts to destabilize the situation in Ukraine. A large amount of misinformation, manipulation, and fakes are spreading in Ukrainian and international media in order to cause panic among Ukrainians and foreigners, intimidate business, and undermine the economic and financial stability of our state. In this situation, it is important to soberly assess the risks and stay calm,"" Nikolenko added. Just four countries have followed the U.S., to varying degrees -- the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada and Germany. ""We cannot allow ourselves for that to happen - that our economy falls. If people cross into a state of panic, that is a dangerous situation for our country, and it will be far easier to then manipulate us, and that is Russia's goal,"" warned Aleksey Danilov, a top Ukrainian national security official. Some economic damage is already apparent. Yields on Ukrainian sovereign Eurobonds in U.S. dollars suddenly shot up to 11-14% on Jan. 14 and have risen even higher since -- losing Ukraine access to the international financial market, according to Anders Åslund, a senior fellow at the Stockholm Free World Forum. ""Ukraine's emerging economic problems are entirely due to the shadow cast by the threat of a dramatic escalation in Russian military aggression,"" Åslund wrote for the Atlantic Council, a Washington-based think tank. The White House and State Department defended the administration's decisions and rhetoric, denying that drawing down the embassy, putting 8,500 U.S. troops on alert, and warning of an ""imminent"" threat have escalated the situation. ""I will let others assess, but there are 100,000 troops -- Russian troops -- on the border of Ukraine and no clarity that the leader of Russia doesn't intend to invade. That sounds pretty dangerous to me,"" White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Tuesday. But 100,000 is not enough for an invasion, according to Malyar and the top commander for Ukraine's forces on the frontlines. Lt. Gen. Oleksander Pavlyuk told ABC News last week that Ukraine had assessed Russian had 127,000 troops in total, although the U.S. still says approximately 100,000. Either way, Ukraine's own army is approximately 200,000 strong now, and many more Russian troops would be needed to invade a country the size of Texas. The number of Russian troops is also ""not increasing in the way that today many are representing,"" Danilov, who serves as secretary of Ukraine's national security council, told the BBC in an interview Tuesday. ""Is it unpleasant for us? Yes, but for us, it's not news. If for someone in the West that has become news, well, I'm sorry."" Still, Psaki denied there was daylight between Washington and Kyiv, adding, ""We are in constant contact with Ukrainians to reiterate our support, to convey updates on shipments of supplies, military equipment -- something that's been happening over the last several days."" Nikolenko too highlighted that military cooperation, praising ""its proactive diplomatic position and for strengthening Ukraine's defense capabilities, including the provision of weapons and equipment."" Asked about the differences, the top U.S. diplomat in Ukraine Kristina Kvien denied there were any. In an exclusive interview Tuesday where a shipment of U.S. Javelin anti-tank and other weapons was being unleaded, she told ABC News, ""President Zelenskyy is taking the threat very seriously, and he is being careful to make preparations as needed."" The Ukrainian people have ""been living with Russian threats for a long time, so I would say that they are just a bit more 'sang-froid' as they say in French. But that doesn't mean that they don't take them seriously,"" added Kvien, the embassy's chargé d'affaires. In Kyiv, there is calm, if at least more talk now about the threat of a Russian attack -- whether across the border, in cyber space, or through continued efforts to destabilize Ukraine's government and economy. ""This looks and feels different … It certainly has people a lot more alert, especially if you watch the news all the time,"" said Reno Domenico, an American businessman who has lived in Ukraine for 15 years. But he said the cafes remain full, and people are out shopping because, ""People don't panic, and panic is a bad thing. You make bad decisions when you panic."" After the U.S. Embassy urged Americans to consider departing immediately, Domenico said more people started talking about the possibility. While everyone should have a plan, he added, his is to stay put for now. ABC News's Patrick Reevell contributed to this report from Kyiv, Ukraine, and Desiree Adib from New York.",4,,,,9
2022-01-25,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/canadas-foreign-affairs-department-hit-cyberattack/story?id=82450324,Canada’s foreign affairs department hit with cyberattack,"Canada's foreign affairs department was hit with a cyberattack last week, according to the Treasury Board of Canada. The hack of Global Affairs Canada, the government entity responsible for diplomatic and global relations, occurred on Wednesday, according to a statement provided by the Treasury Board to ABC News. The statement does not identify who carried out the cyberattack. As a result of the attack, some access the internet and internet-based services are not currently available, but mitigation measures were being taken to restore them. The Treasury Board said no other government department experienced a cyberattack. ""We are constantly reviewing measures to protect Canadians and our critical infrastructure from electronic threats, hacking, and cyber espionage. We encourage all government and non-government partners to use cyber security best practices,"" the statement says. The attack comes amid tensions over Ukraine and two days after the Canada Centre for Cyber Security warned malware was being used to target Ukrainian organizations. On Sunday, the Department of Homeland Security warned that the U.S. could be a target of Russian cyberattacks if the government responds to a possible Russian invasion of Ukraine.",20,,,,5

""If he were to move in with all those forces, it would be the largest invasion since World War II. It would change the world,"" Biden told reporters at an unannounced stop at a local business in Washington. Asked about what would lead him to deploy the troops staging nearby, Biden said that depends on ""what Putin does or doesn't do"" but he repeated that American forces would not move into Ukraine. ""I may be moving some of those troops in the nearer term, just because it takes time,"" Biden said, adding it's not to be ""provocative"" but to reassure NATO allies whom have reasons for concern. ""We have no intention of putting American forces, or NATO forces, in Ukraine. But we -- as I said -- they're gonna be serious economic consequences if he [Putin] moves,"" Biden added. Asked whether the risk of an invasion is increasing, decreasing or steady, Biden compared assessing Putin's intentions to ""reading tea leaves."" ""The fact that he continues to build forces along Ukraine's border from Belarus, all the way around, you'd say, 'Well that means that he is looking like he's trying to do something.' But then you look at what his past behavior is and what everyone is saying on his team, as well as everyone else, as to what is likely to happen. It all comes down to his -- his decision-making,"" Biden said. Amid the escalating tensions, Biden had a one hour and 20-minute conference call from the White House on Monday with the leaders of the European Commission, European Council, NATO, France, Germany, Italy, Poland and the United Kingdom, according to the White House, which said they planned to ""discuss diplomacy, deterrence and defense efforts"" as well as what would constitute potential sanctions against Russia. The White House said after the call that Biden and European leaders ""reiterated their continued concern about the Russian military build-up on Ukraine's borders"" and also discussed ""preparations to impose massive consequences and severe economic costs on Russia for such actions as well as to reinforce security on NATO's eastern flank."" ""We're all on the same page,"" Biden said Tuesday. ""You've got to make it clear that that there's no reason for anyone, any member of NATO, to worry whether or not we would, we NATO, would come to their defense.""",4,,,,4
2022-01-24,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/dhs-warns-russian-cyberattack-us-responds-ukraine-invasion/story?id=82441727,DHS warns of Russian cyberattack on US if it responds to Ukraine invasion,"As tensions rise in the standoff over Ukraine, the Department of Homeland Security has warned that the U.S. response to a possible Russian invasion could result in a cyberattack launched against the U.S. by the Russian government or its proxies. ""We assess that Russia would consider initiating a cyber attack against the Homeland if it perceived a US or NATO response to a possible Russian invasion of Ukraine threatened its long-term national security,"" a DHS Intelligence and Analysis bulletin sent to law enforcement agencies around the country and obtained by ABC News said. The bulletin was dated Jan. 23, 2022. Russia, DHS said, has a ""range of offensive cyber tools that it could employ against US networks,"" and the attacks could range from a low level denial of service attack, to ""destructive"" attacks targeting critical infrastructure. ""We assess that Russia's threshold for conducting disruptive or destructive cyber attacks in the Homeland probably remains very high and we have not observed Moscow directly employ these types of cyber attacks against US critical infrastructure—notwithstanding cyber espionage and potential prepositioning operations in the past,"" the bulletin said. Last year, cybercriminals based in Russia caused two of the most destructive cyberattacks in recent memory, the U.S. has said. Colonial Pipeline was the victim of a ransomware attack in May 2021, shutting down operations and causing widespread outages across the country, and meat supplier JBS had its operations shutdown due to Russian based hackers. Russia is also responsible for the SolarWinds breach in late 202o, the U.S. has said, where the U.S. says Russian-backed cybercriminals gained access to 10 U.S. government agencies including the Department of Homeland Security and Department of Commerce. DHS says Russia ""continues to target"" and gain access to critical infrastructure in the United States, but Russia does not limit itself to conducting cyber operations just in the U.S. The bulletin says in 2015 and 2016, Russian military intelligence assets launched a cyberattack against Ukraine's power grid. Although the bulletin doesn't mention it, Ukrainian officials most recently pointed the finger at Russia for another cyber outage, shutting down government websites. The Department regularly shares information regarding a variety of issues, with federal, local and state partners, a DHS spokesperson said. ""We have increased operational partnerships between private sector companies and the federal government to strengthen our nation’s cyber defenses, including through CISA’s newly established Joint Cyber Defense Collaborative (JCDC),"" the spokesperson continued. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas told reporters last week that the United States is on a ""heightened alert"" for cyberattacks given ""geopolitical landscape."" He told reporters at the U.S. Conference of Mayors on Thursday that it is ""difficult to calibrate the likelihood"" of something happening. ""The whole point is, when the specter of harm arises, we call for vigilance and quite frankly, in the cybersecurity arena. ever present vigilance is what we call for,"" he said.",20,,,,5
2022-01-24,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/International/nato-put-forces-standby-amid-fears-russian-attack/story?id=82437821,NATO to put more forces on standby amid fears of Russian attack on Ukraine,"KYIV, Ukraine -- Amid deepening anxiety over a possible Russian invasion of Ukraine, the United States announced it's pulling out diplomats' families and some staff from its embassy in the country. Meanwhile, NATO announced it was putting extra forces on standby. As Russia continues to mass tens of thousands of troops close to Ukraine's borders, NATO said the alliance was sending a small number of ships and fighter jets to Eastern Europe to strengthen its ""deterrence"" presence there and reassure its eastern members, Denmark is sending a frigate to the Baltic Sea and four F-16 warplanes to Lithuania. At the same time, France is ready to send troops to Romania under NATO command, and Spain is considering deploying fighter jets to Bulgaria, NATO said in a statement. The Netherlands has agreed to send two F-35 jets to Bulgaria and has put a ship and land-based forces on standby for a NATO response force, officials said. ""NATO will continue to take all necessary measures to protect and defend all Allies, including by reinforcing the eastern part of the Alliance,"" NATO's Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said in a statement. The NATO announcement coincided with a report in The New York Times that the Biden administration may be preparing to send up to 5,000 American troops to Eastern European members of the alliance. The White House and the Pentagon have not confirmed the report, though the administration has previously said sending more U.S. troops to Eastern Europe is on the table if Russia attacks Ukraine. NATO on Monday said the ""United States has also made clear that it is considering increasing its military presence in the eastern part of the Alliance."" The steps to boost NATO's readiness came as the U.S. State Department announced Sunday it was ordering the families of its diplomats at its embassy in Ukraine's capital Kyiv to leave the country over security fears. The State Department said it has also authorized non-emergency staff at the embassy to depart voluntarily. The United Kingdom on Monday followed suit, with its Foreign Office saying some embassy staff and their dependents would be withdrawn ""in response to the growing threat from Russia."" Ukraine's government criticized the U.S. evacuation calling them ""premature"" and ""excessively cautious."" ""While we respect right of foreign nations to ensure safety & security of their diplomatic missions, we believe such a step to be a premature one & an instance of excessive caution,"" Oleg Nikolenko, a spokesman for Ukraine's foreign ministry, tweeted. Ukrainian officials are unhappy with the message the evacuations send by suggesting that a Russian invasion could be imminent. In general, they are much more skeptical that Russia is planning to launch a major attack and worry that western countries risk helping Moscow by exaggerating the risk and spreading panic. Privately, American officials acknowledge there is a gap between the Ukrainian and U.S. assessment of the level of threat. Speaking on condition of anonymity, a U.S. official told ABC News this weekend that Ukraine was ""p----- off"" over the evacuations. A senior State Department official on Sunday insisted the embassy drawdown did not undermine America's commitment to Ukraine, saying they were just ""prudent precautions"" given the heightened fear of a Russian attack. The official said the decision was ""based on this military buildup, based on how we see these developments,"" calling it the ""right moment."" Those leaving the embassy will do so on commercial flights, the State Department has said, indicating it is not an emergency evacuation. The State Department were scarred by the chaotic evacuation of Afghanistan, where thousands of Americans were stranded after the sudden Taliban takeover there caught the U.S. off guard. Officials are anxious to avoid a similar situation in Ukraine, should the worst happen. Russia has repeatedly insisted it has no intention of attacking Ukraine. However, its military buildup continues near Ukraine's eastern border and now in Belarus, where trainloads of Russian tanks and artillery have been arriving for joint exercises there. A top commander of Russian-controlled separatist rebels in eastern Ukraine on Monday also accused Ukraine's military of preparing to launch an offensive against the separatist areas. The U.S. and Ukraine are concerned that a false claim of a Ukrainian offensive against the separatists could be used as a pretext for Russia to launch an invasion. Eduard Basurin, the head of the militia of the separatists' self-declared 'People's Republic of Donetsk' (DNR), in local media warned it ""firmly recommends the enemy to give up its criminal intentions,"" promising the Ukrainian army ""will suffer irreparable damage, after which it will not be able to recover."" Ukraine's government has insisted it will not launch any offensive and there is no evidence Ukraine is preparing to.",4,,,,26
2022-01-20,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/us-escalates-pressure-russia-approving-arms-accusing-plot/story?id=82373499,"US escalates pressure on Russia, approving new arms and accusing it of plot against Ukraine","Ahead of a key meeting on Friday between the U.S. and Russia, the Biden administration on Thursday pushed a full-scale campaign to pressure Moscow as Russian leader Vladimir Putin weighs a possible attack on its neighbor Ukraine. The U.S. approved its NATO allies in the Baltics to provide additional arms to Ukraine, including critical anti-aircraft missiles that escalate U.S. support. The U.S. Treasury sanctioned four Ukrainian officials it accused of working with Russian intelligence, including to form a new government backed by Russian occupying forces. The State Department blasted a Russian disinformation campaign it said was part of its ""pretext"" to invade Ukraine and ""divide the international reaction to its actions."" One day before his sit-down with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, Secretary of State Antony Blinken tried to push back on Russia's narrative and make clear just how high the stakes are in the standoff. ""It's bigger than a conflict between two countries. It's bigger than Russia and NATO. It's a crisis with global consequences, and it requires global attention and action,"" the top U.S. diplomat said in Berlin, hours after meeting his German, French, and British counterparts to coordinate a response. That coordination has had tremendous doubt cast on it after President Joe Biden said Wednesday that the NATO alliance was not united about how to respond to aggression from Russia that fell short of an all-out attack on Ukraine -- an uncomfortable truth that U.S. and NATO officials have tried to paper over for weeks. After the White House scrambled to clean that up, Biden himself clarified on Thursday, ""If any -- any -- assembled Russian units move across the Ukrainian border, that is an invasion. But -- and it will be met with severe and coordinated economic response that I've discussed in detail with our allies."" But the challenge remains of what the U.S. and its allies will do if Russia attacks Ukraine with the same gray-zone tactics it has used for the last eight years, as it annexed Crimea, launched a war in eastern Ukraine, and began a slow-motion annexation of those provinces. That war, which has killed approximately 14,000 people, rages on in fits and starts on the frontlines -- and in cyberspace. Ukrainian government websites were hacked in """"the largest cyberattack on Ukraine in the last four years,"" a Ukrainian cyber official said Wednesday, and Moscow has launched a ""disinformation storm"" portraying Ukraine as the aggressor and trying to ""build public support for a further Russian invasion,"" a senior State Department official said Thursday. The Kremlin's campaign to destabilize its smaller, democratic neighbor allegedly includes spies on the ground, collecting information and even plotting to form a new Ukrainian government. ""Russia has directed its intelligence services to recruit current and former Ukrainian government officials to prepare to take over the government of Ukraine and to control Ukraine’s critical infrastructure with an occupying Russian force,"" the U.S. Treasury said in a statement. The U.S. has sanctioned two sitting members of Ukrainian parliament, Taras Kozak and Oleh Voloshyn, who it accused of furthering a plot by the FSB, Russia's main security agency and the successor of the KGB. The agency, which Biden said Wednesday has forces on the ground in Ukraine, is ""destabilizing the political situation in Ukraine and laying the groundwork for creating a new, Russian-controlled government in Ukraine,"" Treasury added. In the face of that effort, the U.S. is hoping that transparency can undercut any pretext Russian operatives or their Ukrainian colleagues may create -- just as the White House last week accused the Kremlin of positioning operatives trained in urban warfare and explosives and planning a possible ""false-flag"" operation. Russia has denied that, calling it ""complete disinformation."" It has said repeatedly it does not plan to attack the former Soviet state, even as Putin warned that his demands, including barring Ukraine from joining NATO, be met or Russia will take ""military technical"" measures. The U.S. is taking its own military measures, approving the transfer of more weaponry to Ukraine -- this time from Lithuania, Estonia, and Latvia, a State Department spokesperson confirmed, while declining to say what weapons exactly. But a Lithuanian Ministry of Defense source told ABC News the country was given the green light to transfer to Ukraine Javelin anti-tank missiles and Stinger portable surface-to-air missiles. The Baltic state wanted to send the weapons even earlier, but because they were originally U.S. provided, it needed American approval, which only came during consultations Wednesday, the source said. Stingers are a kind of man-portable air-defense system, or MANPAD, where an individual soldier can carry the weapon and use it to down fighter aircraft. Javelins, which the Trump administration provided after the Obama administration had refused, have become an important weapon for Ukraine to pierce Russian-made tanks, which could come rolling across the border in an invasion . Ukraine's military capacity still pales in comparison to Russia's overwhelming military superiority, and it's unclear how many missiles are being provided. Lithuania has only 54 of the missiles in its inventory and only eight launchers from which to fire them from, meaning the amount provided to Ukraine will likely be even lower. Still, Stinger missiles in particular represent a symbolic threshold that previous administrations had not crossed. While some lawmakers have called for providing them and even more advanced weapons like a missile defense system, others have warned going too far could provoke Putin. Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., who was in Kyiv earlier this week as part of a bipartisan congressional delegation, said Thursday that in this ""very fragile time... it would not be helpful to give Putin an excuse to invade Ukraine, so I think we've got to be very thoughtful about how we address some of these issues like a missile system,"" like the advanced Patriot missile system. Russia has already warned that it sees any Western weapons provided to Ukraine as a threat, especially after the U.S. announced $200 million in new military aid ($650 million total over the last year) and the United Kingdom announced it provided anti-tank missiles. Russia, however, has warned that it sees any Western weapons provided to Ukraine as a threat. ""We underline the necessity of ceasing boosting the war-like Ukrainian regime with arms deliveries ... and a lot else that represents a direct threat for us,"" Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said Wednesday. But Blinken pushed back on that Thursday in a major speech, disputing the Russian narrative and making clear Moscow is the aggressor. ""On its face, that’s absurd. NATO didn't invade Georgia, NATO didn't invade Ukraine - Russia did,"" he said, adding NATO neighbors account for six percent of Russia's borders and have 5,000 allied troops in those countries, while Russia has massed 20 times that around Ukraine. There has been tense speculation about whether Putin will attack Ukraine, with Biden saying Wednesday he believes the strongman leader will ""move in."" But Blinken said Thursday the U.S. still believes he has not made up his mind yet, but added his animus towards Ukraine has long been known. ""He's told us repeatedly - he's laying the groundwork for an invasion because he doesn't believe that Ukraine is a sovereign nation,"" Blinken said. That argument has been a key part of Russia's disinformation ecosystem, which has been in overdrive in recent weeks, according to senior State Department officials. Russia's military and intelligence entities have deployed 3,500 posts per day in December -- an increase of 200 percent from November -- as they seek to ""create conditions conducive to success of attempted aggression in Ukraine and elsewhere and to divide the international reaction to its actions,"" a senior State Department official told reporters. ""These are not just public statements from Russia's MFA accounts ... These are broader campaigns using shell companies, false names, and layers to conceal the real backers and their intentions,"" a second senior State Department official said, calling it ""a war on truth."" Russia must pull back its propaganda campaign in addition to its troops on Ukraine's borders, the official added, echoing previous U.S. calls for de-escalation to give diplomacy a shot. Whether or not diplomacy has a shot will be tested again Friday in Geneva, where Blinken and Lavrov will meet. A senior State Department official said earlier in the week that the meeting itself is a sign the door to diplomacy remains open, but the two sides continue to talk past each other. The two diplomats will ""discuss draft agreements on security guarantees,"" Russia's embassy in Washington tweeted Thursday - a reference to its demands that NATO bar Ukraine from joining and pull back forces from Eastern European member states. But U.S. officials have repeatedly called those ""nonstarters,"" and Blinken said Wednesday in Kyiv he would not be ""presenting a paper"" to Lavrov in response. That has raised fears that Moscow is simply using diplomatic talks to see them fail - yet another pretext before an attack. But regardless of whether there's a full-born assault, Russia has now effectively shaken Ukraine once again. Its president Volodymyr Zelenskyy tried to reassure the nation late Wednesday, even pushing back on the U.S. warnings that the threat is more urgent. ""These risks have been there for more than one day, and they haven't grown nowadays - there is just more buzz around them,"" he said in a televised address.

2022-01-20,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/cia-foreign-actor-havana-syndrome-cases/story?id=82376545,CIA says foreign actor may be behind some Havana syndrome cases,"The CIA has assessed that the ""majority"" of reported cases of unexplained medical symptoms known as ""Havana syndrome"" can be ""reasonably explained by medical conditions or environmental and technical factors,"" a senior CIA official told ABC News. The spy agency has assessed it's ""unlikely that a foreign actor, including Russia, is conducting a sustained, worldwide campaign harming U.S. personnel with a weapon or mechanism,"" they added. But they left the door open to the possibility that some personnel have been attacked by a still-unknown actor or device, saying a foreign actor's role has not been ruled out ""in specific cases. We're still looking."" The issue has vexed U.S. officials for over five years now after the first incidents were reported by personnel at the U.S. embassy in Cuba. Since then, scores of cases have been reported on nearly every continent in over a dozen countries, especially after the CIA and State Department urged employees to come forward if they experienced symptoms. But it was never clear how many of those reports were later confirmed as medically diagnosed cases. In a rare statement, CIA Director Bill Burns said those symptoms are ""real,"" his agency's commitment to providing care for officers is ""unwavering"" and its investigation is ""not done."" ""We are pursuing this complex issue with analytic rigor, round tradecraft, and compassion and have dedicated intensive resources to this challenge,"" he said. ""While underlying causes may differ, our officers are suffering real symptoms."" In a note to all staff obtained by ABC News, Secretary of State Antony Blinken also offered strong support for employees and encouraged diplomats and their families to continue reporting potential incidents. ""Those who have been affected have real stories to tell -- their pain is real. There is no doubt in my mind about that,"" he wrote. But many of the affected personnel are outraged or upset by the CIA's assessment, with some like Marc Polymeropoulos, a retired CIA agent who was affected while on assignment in Moscow, fearing they will not be believed or will be ""mocked and vilified."" ""I remain grateful of the health care that Director Burns has agreed to provide for those who have been impacted, but now victims are being shamed and mocked,"" Polymeropoulos said, calling it ""a return to the early days of Havana where officers were not believed."" A declassified internal government watchdog report found that the State Department moved too slowly to address the issues when personnel first reported incidents and symptoms in November 2016. Symptoms have included headaches, dizziness, cognitive difficulties, tinnitus, vertigo and trouble with seeing, hearing, or balancing. Many officials have suffered symptoms years after reporting an incident while some have been diagnosed with traumatic brain injuries. Beyond Cuba, cases of what the Biden administration has called ""anomalous health incidents,"" or AHI's, have been reported in China, Austria, Germany, Vietnam, India, Uzbekistan and Colombia, among other countries. There have even been reports of incidents in the U.S., although the White House said the vast majority are overseas. But the CIA assessment found that ""previously undiagnosed illnesses, environmental factors, reporting out of an abundance of caution"" led to the majority of the cases, the senior official said. ""Many of the reports came in following growing workforce awareness of AHI's - after requests by departments and agencies for personnel to come forward,"" they added. ""This finding doesn't call into question at all the fact that our officers are reporting real symptoms and experiences. It's just that there's not one single cause that can be explained."" But after media reports emerged, some critics cast doubt again on whether U.S. personnel experienced anything at all, sparking anger in other corners that the CIA had undermined its personnel and those from other agencies. ""The CIA's interim conclusions are incredibly disappointing, insulting to those who are suffering, and highly suspect,"" whistleblower attorney Mark Zaid, who represents over a dozen affected employees, said in an email to ABC News. ""Once again, it is demonstrated that the failure of the government to produce a uniform, expert report only causes further controversy rather than resolution."" Zaid said the agency was ""more likely"" issuing it ""to allay a workforce which in recent months has been refusing overseas assignments in the wake of an overwhelming number of reported new cases among its ranks."" ""Other agencies [are] furious no coordination occurred & they disagree,"" he added in a tweet, calling the interim report ""disinformation."" ""It's not disinformation. That's absurd,"" the senior CIA official said in response, adding the assessment was conducted ""with the normal partners"" and through ""the intelligence community process."" Blinken also tried to address personnel's concerns about being believed. While he declined to address the assessment during a press conference in Berlin on Thursday, he told reporters employees ""have had real experiences, real symptoms, and real suffering, and we are going to continue to do everything we can with all the resources we can bring to bear to understand, again, what happened, why, and who might be responsible."" What is clear is that the report is preliminary. Lawmakers called for the CIA to continue to probe the issue, especially those cases that remain unexplained. ""Today's assessment, while rigorously conducted, reflects only the interim work of the CIA task force,"" said Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., chair of the Senate intelligence committee, which ""will continue pressing for answers on a bipartisan basis,"" he added. His Republican counterpart, ranking member Marco Rubio, R-Fla., reiterated that, saying the CIA ""must continue to make this issue a priority and seek answers to the causes of mysterious symptoms, including brain injury, and whether they can be attributed to the work of a foreign government or a specific weapon or device, particularly in a core group of cases."" It's unclear exactly how many cases are in that ""core group"" that remains under active investigation. The senior CIA official said that it numbers around a ""couple dozen"" and that it could still involve a ""foreign actor."" ""We're not ruling it out in specific cases. We're still looking,"" they said, but added, ""There are no patterns or linkages at this stage."" Russia had long been suspected in some circles as being behind the incidents, but it's unclear how or with what device such an attack would be possible. Blinken said last week that he and other U.S. officials have raised the issue with the Russians even without clear attribution. Asked whether he would raise the issue with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov when they meet Friday, Blinken declined to comment Thursday.",20,,,,0

""I've been absolutely clear with President Putin. He has no misunderstanding. If any, any, assembled Russian units move across the Ukrainian border, that is an invasion. But -- and it will be met with severe and coordinated economic response that I've discussed in detail with our allies, as well as laid out very clearly for President Putin,"" he told reporters. ""Let there be no doubt at all: If Putin makes this choice, Russia will pay a heavy price,"" Biden added. The clarification comes after he seemed to throw into question how the U.S. and NATO would respond if Russia did take action against Ukraine -- in the case of what he called a ""minor incursion."" ""It's one thing if it's a minor incursion and then we end up having a fight about what to do and not do, et cetera,"" Biden said Wednesday. ""But if they actually do what they're capable of doing with the force they've massed on the border, it is going to be a disaster for Russia if they further invade Ukraine."" Wednesday evening, shortly after his news conference, White House press secretary issued a statement attempting to clarify Biden's suggestion the NATO alliance might be divided, saying, in part, ""If any Russian military forces move across the Ukrainian border, that's a renewed invasion, and it will be met with a swift, severe, and united response from the United States and our Allies."" Secretary of State Antony Blinken, in Berlin meeting with Germany's Chancellor Scholtz ahead of his talks Friday with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, said, ""We have been very clear throughout -- if any Russian military forces move across the Ukrainian border and commit new acts of aggression against Ukraine, that will be met with a swift, severe, united response from the United States and our allies and partners."" Vice President Kamala Harris, in several network morning show appearances Thursday, also tried to clean up the president's comments. ""We will interpret any violation of Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity by Russia and Vladimir Putin as an aggressive action, and it will be met with costs, severe and certain,"" Harris told ABC's George Stephanopoulos on ""Good Morning America."" Biden's initial comments were quickly met with criticism from Republican lawmakers, including Sen. Rob Portman, who was part of a congressional delegation that traveled to Ukraine earlier this week. Portman tweeted he was ""deeply troubled"" by Biden's remarks, adding ""any Russian military incursion into Ukraine should be viewed as a major one that could likely destabilize Ukraine and Europe."" Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell was also critical, saying Biden's news conference was ""a bizarre and devastating performance, especially -- I would add -- for our friends on the front lines."" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy seemed to issue his own rebuke of Biden's comments in a pointed tweet Thursday morning. ""We want to remind the great powers that there are no minor incursions and small nations. Just as there are no minor casualties and little grief from the loss of loved ones.

The visit, which included President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, was meant to send a strong signal to Russia ahead of Blinken's meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov on Friday -- a critical sit-down after the White House warned Russia could attack ""at any point"" now. With approximately 100,000 troops massed near Ukraine's borders, including now in neighboring Belarus, Russia has demanded the U.S. and NATO bar Ukraine from joining the military alliance and pull back troops from Eastern European member states. If not, Russian leader Vladimir Putin has threatened ""military technical"" consequences, even as his government denies it is planning to invade. Eight years after Russia's annexation of Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula and amid its slow-motion annexation of eastern provinces known as the Donbas, Blinken urged Ukrainians to unify and promised continued U.S. support. ""Don't let Moscow divide you,"" Blinken said during a press conference with Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba, adding, ""As you stand up to efforts to divide, to intimidate, to threaten, the United States stands with you resolutely in your right to make decisions for your own future, to shape that future as Ukrainians for Ukraine."" As a critical part of that effort, President Joe Biden approved $200 million of military aid to Ukraine, a senior State Department official confirmed Wednesday. That brings total U.S. military assistance in the last year to over half a billion dollars -- $650 million in total, including Javelin anti-tank missiles, patrol boats, ammunition, medical equipment and more. Biden approved the package late last month and used an authority to bypass arms control regulations to swiftly provide aid in an emergency, according to congressional sources briefed on the aid. But the State Department had not confirmed the tranche was approved, even after it was reported in the media last week. There were fears that it would anger the Russians during three rounds of high-stakes talks -- between the U.S. and Russia, NATO and Russia, and at the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov, one of Russia's top negotiators during those talks, criticized giving U.S. arms to Ukraine again on Wednesday -- something Moscow has complained about as it casts its much smaller neighbor as a threat. ""We underline the necessity of ceasing boosting the war-like Ukrainian regime with arms deliveries, training assistance, the development of plans and their implementation in erecting military bases, conducting training events and a lot else that represents a direct threat for us,"" Ryabkov said, according to Russian news agencies. The defensive weapons the U.S. has provided would do little to push back against Russia's overwhelming military power. Some analysts have suggested Russia may be considering an attack on Ukraine now before the former Soviet state's military grows stronger, its democracy and economy become more stable, and its relations fall into greater alignment with Western Europe and the U.S. ""We have been providing defensive assistance to Ukraine consistently, including deliveries that are taking place in just the last few weeks alone,"" Blinken told reporters, declining to provide details or even mention the $200 million. Kuleba added that Ukraine is ""very strong"" now and praised the Biden administration for its ""very good cooperation... in the area of military assistance."" ""We know that the United States stands with us not only in the area of security but also in supporting our internal strength,"" he added. But Republican lawmakers in Washington urged Biden to do more, including sanctioning Russian officials and providing more lethal arms to Ukraine before a potential Russian attack, not after one. Sen. Jim Inhofe, R-Okla., the top Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee, said Biden's administration ""is about three months behind where they should be at this time"" and too focused ""on what the U.S. would do after Russia invades, not what are they going to do to stop Russia from invading."" A bipartisan group of lawmakers met with Biden Wednesday morning, including senators who just returned from a congressional delegation to Kyiv. Both the White House and Republican senators described it as constructive and informative, with Sen. Kevin Cramer, R-S.D., saying Biden ""listened attentively. He shared a lot as well."" Fighting in the Donbas has killed some 14,000 people and counting, with tensions periodically flaring as Russian forces or the local separatists they lead exchange artillery or sniper fire with Ukrainian troops. The gray-zone conflict has kept Ukraine on a war footing with fears that Russia could eventually annex the region, where it has given out Russian citizenship to residents. A bill urging Putin to recognize the Russian-controlled regions as independent was proposed in the Russian parliament Wednesday. The U.S. also said it has intelligence that Russia has positioned operatives trained in urban warfare and explosives in Ukraine for potential ""false-flag"" operations that would give it pretext to attack. The Kremlin denied that was true, calling it ""complete disinformation,"" but NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said Wednesday there is ""a significant Russian presence of intelligence officers or operatives inside Ukraine"" who are ""trying to undermine the government, the authorities and also absolutely possible that they are also planning for different incidents, accidents, false flag operations."" A cyberattack on Ukrainian government websites Friday may have been part of that strategy as well, according to Ukrainian officials. Andriy Kuzmich, a senior Ukrainian government cyber official, called it ""the largest cyberattack on Ukraine in the last four years, at least in scale,"" although it's unclear if Russian government or non-state actors were responsible. The U.S. has not made any attribution yet. Amid all the threats and warnings, both sides seem to believe the door is still open to diplomacy with Blinken and Lavrov's Friday meeting. The Kremlin said the U.S. proposed the sit down. Russian officials have said they are growing impatient with the series of meetings, with Ryabkov saying Wednesday they will not ""wait endlessly."" ""We are not prepared to get bogged down in the usual diplomatic, bureaucratic hoopla... We need a clear and direct answer, moreover in written form,"" they said. On that last request, the U.S. and Russia are also at odds. The Russian Foreign Ministry published two draft treaties in December, laying out its demands about NATO, Ukraine and more -- many of which U.S. officials said were ""nonstarters."" But their demands to receive a response in writing are also for now being rejected. ""I won't be presenting a paper at that time to Foreign Minister Lavrov. We need to see where we are and see if there remain opportunities to pursue the diplomacy and pursue the dialogue,"" Blinken said in Kyiv. ""We're taking stock of the conversations [last week] and will pursue this on Friday in Geneva, and I suspect I'll have more to say then."" Before traveling to Geneva, Blinken will stop in Berlin on Thursday to meet Germany's new chancellor Olaf Scholz and foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, and hold a joint meeting with her and their British and French counterparts -- again projecting unity against Moscow. Russia has been using its own alliances to strengthen its hand, speculating that it may position troops near the U.S. in two key Latin American ally countries, Venezuela and Cuba, and move forces into Belarus for joint military exercises. Those troops, which first began arriving over the weekend, have alarmed U.S. officials, who have said it gives Russia another launchpad to attack Ukraine -- and one that's hundreds of miles closer to Kyiv. A senior State Department official warned Tuesday that Russia is seizing power in Belarus and questioned how involved strongman Alexander Lukashenko was in the decision to bring in Russian troops. But some argue that all of these escalations -- Russian troop movements, bellicose rhetoric, draft treaties -- are about Putin creating leverage from a weak hand to project strength and protect himself. ""It just takes my breath away to watch how Putin pulls this on the American establishment again and again: threaten to escalate - negotiate - pull back; threaten to escalate - negotiate - pull back,"" Russian opposition leader Alexey Navalny told TIME from prison, the magazine reported Wednesday. ""Instead of ignoring this nonsense, the U.S. accepts Putin's agenda and runs to organize some meetings. Just like a frightened schoolboy who's been bullied by an upperclassman,"" added Navalny, who was poisoned by Russian agents and imprisoned upon his return to the country.

2022-01-18,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/extremely-dangerous-moment-top-us-diplomat-travels-ukraine/story?id=82329712,"In 'extremely dangerous' moment, top US diplomat travels to Ukraine, to meet Russian counterpart","Secretary of State Antony Blinken is traveling to Ukraine, Germany, and Switzerland this week - a sign ""perhaps that diplomacy is not dead,"" a senior State Department official said Tuesday. As Russia continues to mass troops and military equipment near Ukraine's borders, including now in allied Belarus, the U.S. and European countries have become increasingly concerned the Kremlin may be preparing to launch an attack on Ukraine. But Blinken will meet his Russian counterpart, Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, in Geneva on Friday, keeping the door to diplomacy open. ""This is an extremely dangerous situation. We're now at a stage where Russia could at any point launch an attack in Ukraine,"" White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Tuesday -- a sharp rise in the United States' rhetorical warnings that Russian lead Vladimir Putin may attack his neighbor. Before sitting down with Lavrov, Blinken will meet Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy and Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba in his second visit to Kyiv as secretary - one week after CIA Director Bill Burns visited - and travel to Berlin for a summit with his German, French, and British counterparts. Months of Russian troop buildups and bellicose rhetoric led to a series of high-stakes diplomatic meetings last week. But the one-on-one U.S.-Russia talks, a summit between NATO and Moscow, and a meeting of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe ended inconclusively. Putin laid out his demands in two draft treaties last month, including that Ukraine be barred from joining NATO and that the Western military alliance pull its troops out of Eastern European member states. But for weeks, the U.S. and NATO have called those nonstarters, instead offering to negotiate on other issues like arms control or military exercises and threatening massive sanctions if Russia attacks Ukraine. Russia has denied that it plans to invade Ukraine, where its troops have led eastern forces in a war against the government for eight years now and continue to occupy the peninsula Crimea. It has warned that if its demands aren't met, it will respond with ""military technical"" measures. Rather than tensions defusing, the threat of conflict seems to be rising, engineered by Russian moves. The Kremlin has begun moving troops into Belarus, Ukraine's neighbor to the north, for military exercises next month, including troops from its far east, Russia's Defense Ministry confirmed Tuesday, saying the exercises were designed to prepare Russian and Belarusian forces to ""thwart and repel a foreign aggression."" ""This is neither an exercise nor normal troop movement,"" the senior State Department official told reporters. ""It is a show of strength designed to cause or give false pretext for a crisis as Russia plans for a possible invasion."" A second senior State Department official went further later on Tuesday, calling into question whether the Belarusian government of strongman Alexander Lukashenko is really in charge and accusing the Kremlin of ""preying"" on his vulnerabilities with this ""concerning"" troop deployment. ""Over time, Lukashenka has relied more and more on Russia for all kinds of support, and we know that Putin doesn't give that support for free. ... There is no escaping that having dedicated his 27 years in office to claiming to be the guarantor of Belarus's sovereignty and independence, Lukashenka has increasingly shown that he will trade it all in order to stay in power,"" the senior official said. The bold accusation seems to be a sign of deep U.S. concern that Putin is making another power move here - this time to deepen his influence in Belarus. But the U.S. clearly sees it as a way for Moscow to more easily attack Ukraine, too - with Kyiv hundreds of miles closer to Belarus's borders than to Ukraine's eastern border with Russia. The deployment gives ""increased capability for Russia to launch this attack - increased opportunity, increased avenues, increased routes"" against Ukraine, the second senior State Department official said. Last Friday, the White House also said the U.S. had intelligence that Russia had positioned operatives trained in urban warfare and explosives for a possible ""false-flag"" operation that could also been used as pretext for an invasion - something the Kremlin denied as ""complete disinformation."" Blinken and Lavrov spoke Tuesday and agreed to meet Friday in Geneva, where U.S. and Russian delegations met last week. Their meeting will be another attempt to deescalate tensions, but it's unclear what new ground there is to tread. ""It is still too early to tell if the Russian government is genuinely interested in diplomacy, if it is prepared to negotiate seriously in good faith, or whether it will use discussions as a pretext to claim that diplomacy didn’t address Moscow’s interest. I just can’t judge that now, but I do understand the desire on our side to test that hypothesis,"" the first senior State Department official said. Before traveling to Switzerland, Blinken will be hosted by Zelenskiy in Kyiv, days after a bipartisan delegation of U.S. lawmakers visited and vowed continued U.S. support too, including arms. ""As we speak there are additional U.S. supplies that are being sent to Ukraine to make sure that they have what they need to fight back,"" Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., told ABC News. Blinken's visit comes on the heels of CIA Director Burns's last week, a senior U.S. official confirmed to ABC News. Burns also met with Zelenskiy and with his intelligence counterparts to discuss current assessments of the risk to Ukraine, the official said. In between Kyiv and Geneva, Blinken will meet German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock for the second time this month, with the new German government critical to the strength of any potential sanctions if Russia invades. Blinken and Baerbock will also meet their French and British counterparts in a show of diplomatic solidarity. There had been some signs of cracks in that unity, however, especially over the Nord Stream 2 pipeline. The project would bring natural gas from Russia to Germany, sidestepping Ukraine and removing a key source of revenue for Kyiv, which has pressed the U.S. to sanction the German company constructing it. But Biden has refused to do so, saying relations with Germany would suffer. Amid intense international pressure, Germany's new chancellor Olaf Scholz indicated Tuesday that he would be prepared to halt the pipeline if Russia attacks Ukraine - another signal of the costs Moscow would face if it moved ahead. ""If Russia does launch an attack on a sovereign country that borders NATO countries, it is likely that NATO will significantly increase its military activities, funding, and even membership - everything Russia claims to be trying to avoid,"" said Mick Mulroy, former deputy secretary of Defense and a retired CIA paramilitary officer. That could include Nord Stream 2's end and increased U.S. arms and training to Ukraine, too - with Mulroy adding, ""Russia could end up in a prolonged counterinsurgency campaign in Ukraine, which they will soon regret.""

2022-01-15,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/International/talks-make-progress-russian-attack-ukraine-analysis/story?id=82273678,"After talks make no progress, is Russian attack on Ukraine more likely?: Analysis","A week of high-profile diplomatic talks between the West and Russia have not dispelled fears that Russia may be preparing to attack Ukraine. Experts, who for months have been trying to understand whether Russia's troop buildup near Ukraine is a negotiating ploy or preparations for a real attack, say the question appears to have become: will Putin use force or not? On Friday, the Biden administration intensified its alarms, warning it believes Russia is ""preparing for an invasion of Ukraine…should diplomacy fail to meet their objectives."" The White House accused Russia of ""pre-positioning"" operatives to be ready to stage a ""false-flag operation"" in eastern Ukraine that would justify a Russian attack. Russia has denied it is preparing to attack Ukraine, but has threatened it may use unspecified ""military technical measures"" if its demands are not met. The concern is that after massing tens of thousands of troops near Ukraine over the last year, Russia in December made extraordinary demands, insisting on security guarantees that NATO will never allow Ukraine to become a member and that the alliance pull back troops from eastern European countries that joined after the Cold War. It made the demands in two draft ""treaties"" handed to the Biden administration and NATO. The U.S. and NATO called the demands a non-starter. But in the three sets of talks this week, Russia did not budge from its core demands. Again and again, its negotiators repeated it will accept nothing less than the NATO security guarantees. While expressing interest in the U.S. offers to discuss arms control, Russian officials said it was impossible to make progress on those areas without the guarantees. The U.S. and NATO in the talks were equally uncompromising in rejecting those guarantees, saying they cannot yield on core principles. The talks seem at an impasse. Russia's lead negotiator, deputy foreign minister Sergey Ryabkov, on Thursday said the efforts had approached a ""dead-end."" Russia's foreign minister Sergey Lavrov has said it is now waiting for written responses from the U.S. to Russia's treaties, after which Putin will decide next steps. The U.S. as well as some analysts have worried Russia was engaging in the talks all along with the expectation they would fail, allowing it to then claim it had no choice to use force after diplomacy failed. Some now said the talks' outcome proved that was the case. It is also possible that the consequences the Kremlin has referred to could be less than an attack on Ukraine, such as deploying missiles closer to Europe, or making its military build up near Ukraine more permanent. Ryabkov in an interview Thursday even refused to rule out deploying Russian weapons to Cuba or Venezuela, something the U.S. quickly dismissed as ""bluster."" But independent analysts say Russia is continuing to build up its forces near Ukraine. Open source researchers this week said there is evidence troops and equipment from units based in Russia's far east are now moving west. Conflict Intelligence Team, an open source group that tracks Russian military movements, said it has found a growing number of videos posted to social media that appeared to show long trains carrying tanks and other military vehicles traveling through eastern towns. Rob Lee, an analyst based at Kings College London's Department of War Studies, told ABC News on Thursday equipment that was being moved. ""It doesn't look routine,"" Lee said. ""It doesn't make that much sense that you'd see this many videos of things moving unless there was something else going on."" He said it was impossible to say definitively yet whether the Russian forces' destination was the border with Ukraine, but added that was ""the most likely explanation."" Most analysts have said they still don't believe Putin has made a final decision on whether to launch an attack. But what comes next seems to be in the Russian president's hands. ""For the moment, the next step is up to Putin,"" Lawrence Freedman, a professor also at the Kings College War Studies Department wrote in a post Friday. After this week's talks, it appears diplomacy seems to have failed to satisfy the Kremlin's objectives.",4,,,,26
2022-01-14,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/us-accuses-russia-fabricating-pretext-invade-ukraine/story?id=82267027,US accuses Russia of 'fabricating a pretext' to invade Ukraine,"After a week of high-stakes diplomacy, the U.S. on Friday accused Russia of ""fabricating a pretext"" to invade its neighbor Ukraine. It's another sign that the ""drumbeats of war"" are getting louder, in the words of one U.S. ambassador, after three key meetings this week to defuse tensions raised by Russia massing approximately 100,000 troops on its borders with Ukraine. But whether Russian President Vladimir Putin will act on a long-held desire to consume Ukraine, or whether his posturing is a bluff to strengthen Moscow's hand and therefore its influence, is still an open question, according to senior U.S. officials. A ""massive"" cyberattack against Ukrainian government sites on Friday sparked new fears that the very kind of sabotage plot that U.S. officials have described could already be underway. ""Russia is laying the groundwork to have the option of fabricating a pretext for invasion, including through sabotage activities and information operations, by accusing Ukraine of preparing an imminent attack against Russian forces in eastern Ukraine,"" a U.S. official said Friday. U.S. intelligence has ""information that indicates Russia has already prepositioned a group of operatives to conduct a false-flag operation in eastern Ukraine,"" the official added, saying the group was trained in urban warfare and the use of explosives. The alleged plot would begin several weeks before Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which he attacked in 2014 by annexing Crimea and fomenting a war in its eastern provinces known as Donbas. That conflict has killed as many as 14,000 people in the last eight years, with artillery and sniper fire still exchanged weekly between Ukrainian government forces and Russian-led separatists. Not long after, White House press secretary Jen Psaki spelled out the U.S. accusations in public. ""We are concerned that the Russian government is preparing for an invasion in Ukraine that may result in widespread human rights violations and war crimes, should diplomacy fail to meet their objectives,"" Psaki told reporters at her daily briefing. ""As part of its plans, Russia is laying the groundwork to have the option of fabricating a pretext for invasion, and we've seen this before. She repeated the U.S. official's assertion that Russian action could occur sometime between the middle of this month and mid-February. ""We have information that indicates Russia has already pre-positioned a group of operatives to conduct a false flag operation in eastern Ukraine,"" Psaki continued. ""The operatives are trained in urban warfare and in using explosives to carry out acts of sabotage against Russia's own proxy forces. Our information also indicates that Russian influence actors are already starting to fabricate Ukrainian provocations in state and social media to justify a Russian intervention and sew divisions in Ukraine."" The Kremlin dismissed the accusations, saying no proof has been presented. ""All these statements still have just the character of hearsay and haven't been confirmed by anything,"" spokesman Dmitry Peskov told the state news agency TASS. The buildup since last fall of nearly 100,000 Russian forces, with potential plans for as many as 175,000, according to U.S. officials, has heightened fears of a full-scale invasion or new attack. In addition to the troops, Russia has stationed artillery systems and electronic warfare systems, according to U.S. ambassador to the OSCE, Michael Carpenter. ""The drumbeat of war is sounding loud, and the rhetoric has gotten rather shrill,"" Carpenter said Thursday after the third and last round of talks with Russia. ""We have to prepare for the eventuality that there could be an escalation."" That rhetoric - accusing Ukraine of abusing human rights and increasing belligerence - has dominated on Russia-language social media, according to the U.S. official. In December, it increased roughly 200 percent to nearly 3,500 posts per day, they said, in order ""to justify a Russian intervention and sow divisions in Ukraine."" That appeared to include a ""massive"" cyberattack against Ukrainian government sites on Friday. Ukraine's Foreign Ministry said theirs and other sites were temporarily down, with a message posted on the site by the attackers, address to ""Ukrainians!"" ""All your information will become public, be afraid and expect the worst. This is for your past, present and future,"" it said in part. Andrei Yermark, a top adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said later Friday that approximately 90 percent of sites have been restored and that critical infrastructure was not affected. No one has claimed responsibility for the attack, and Yermak said the country's security service was investigating now. ""Of course, we have some thoughts,"" he added, saying this kind of attack was ""one of the potential parts of the destabilization"" that officials have warned about. With partners like the U.S. and the U.K., ""We will be ready to answer to this attack and continue to work with our partners to protect,"" he said. Psaki said President Joe Biden was briefed about the cyberattack against Ukrainian government sites, but held back from naming who might be behind it. ""We don't have attribution at this time, and I can't point to any more specifics … I would just note that we will take necessary and proper steps, of course, to defend our allies, support our partners, and support the Ukrainian people, but we're still assessing that at this point in time,"" she said.

Russia met with 30 NATO member states at the alliance's headquarters in Brussels on Wednesday, the second of three diplomatic meetings organized this week in Europe between Russia and Western countries amid fears raised by Russia's massing of 100,000 troops on Ukraine's border. In Wednesday's talks, NATO offered Russia to hold a series of meetings to discuss arms control and other confidence building measures in an attempt to persuade it to lower tensions around Ukraine. The alliance's secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said it had proposed talks on limiting missile deployments and troop exercises as well as how to improve communication and transparency. He told reporters afterward that Russia said it needed to time to consider the offer, but it had not rejected it out of hand. ""We are ready to sit down,"" Stoltenberg told journalists. ""And we hope Russia is ready to sit down and hold these meetings."" But NATO unanimously rebuffed Moscow's core demands for formal guarantees that Ukraine will never join NATO and that the alliance will pull back its forces from countries in Eastern Europe that joined after the Cold War. Russia and the United States held talks on Monday in Geneva where Moscow pressed those demands and which the U.S. rejected as impossible. NATO and the U.S. said they would never compromise on what they called the alliance's ""core principles,"" after Russia's negotiators, Deputy Foreign Minister Alexander Grushko and Deputy Defense Minister Alexander Fomin, presented the same demands again at Wednesday's meeting. ""Together, the United States and our NATO allies made clear we will not slam the door shut on NATO's open-door policy,"" U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman, who led the U.S. delegation, said after the meeting, calling them a ""non-starter."" But while Russia's key demand was again rejected, the door to a diplomatic solution remains open, U.S. and NATO officials said. ""There was no commitment to deescalate, nor was there a statement that there would not be,"" Sherman added, even offering some praise for the Russian delegation for sitting ""through nearly four hours of a meeting where 30 nations spoke -- and they did -- which is not an easy thing to do. I'm glad they did it."" She and Stoltenberg said Russia now had a choice to make whether to engage with dialogue, saying she hoped the Russian negotiators would now go back to President Vladimir Putin and they would choose ""peace and security."" Russia made the sweeping demands over NATO in two draft treaties in December after building up troops close to Ukraine for months. That buildup, along with bellicose rhetoric and plans for ""internal sabotage,"" according to U.S. officials, raised fears that Putin may be preparing to launch a renewed attack on the country after he seized Crimea and launched a separatist war in 2014. Russia has denied it is planning to attack Ukraine, despite the buildup on its border. Amid the diplomatic efforts, it staged live fire exercises on Tuesday with 3,000 troops and hundreds of tanks in three regions neighboring Ukraine. The U.S. and NATO have hoped that Russia might accept more modest offers, such as limiting missile deployments and troop exercises. But Russia's negotiator, Grushko, insisted again Wednesday that Russia could accept nothing less than the guarantees on Ukraine and NATO, calling it ""imperative."" No progress on arms control or confidence-building measures could be made without progress on Moscow's core demands, he told reporters afterward. Grushko said Russia was now waiting for NATO and the U.S. to send written responses to the Russian proposals and that it would then make a decision on how to proceed. Russia has complained for decades about NATO expansion into countries formerly dominated by Moscow under the Soviet Union. The Kremlin now alleges that NATO assistance to Ukraine means the former Soviet country is becoming a defacto part of the alliance. The U.S. and NATO say Moscow's demand is an attempt to reimpose its Soviet-era sphere of influence on Eastern Europe and that it violates a fundamental right for countries to choose their security alliances. Grushko said deescalation was ""absolutely possible,"" but he warned that the alliance's enlargement into Eastern Europe had become ""unbearable"" for Russia, warning if Russia felt threatened it would use ""military means."" ""We have a range of military-technical measures that we will use if we will feel a real threat to our security,"" Grushko said. ""And we already are feeling it, if they are looking at our territory as a target for guided, offensive weapons. Of course, we cannot agree with that. We will take all necessary measures in order to fend off the threat with military means, if political ones don't work."" But Grushko also spoke positively about the talks, saying for the first time he believed Russia had ""managed to convey to the members of the alliance that the situation is unbearable."" Stoltenberg said Russia could not have a veto over Ukraine joining the alliance, saying Russian claims to feel threatened by Ukraine were also wrong. ""Ukraine is a sovereign nation. Ukraine has the right to self-defense,"" he said. ""Ukraine is not a threat to Russia. To say that Ukraine is a threat to Russia is to put the whole thing upside down."" Western officials have been trying to understand whether the threat of a Russian attack on Ukraine is real or a bluff to strengthen Moscow's hands as it makes its demands. Sherman suggested that remained an open question, perhaps even for the Kremlin itself. ""Everyone, Russia most of all, will have to decide whether they really are about security, in which case they should engage, or whether this was all a pretext,"" she said. ""And they may not even know yet."" While the buildup, including the new live-fire exercises Wednesday, could still be a negotiating tactic, some Western officials and independent experts also worry that Russia might be engaging in the talks intending for them to fail, so as to use that as a pretext for a military intervention. ""The United States and our allies and partners are not dragging our feet. It is Russia that has to make a stark choice: deescalation and diplomacy, or confrontation and consequences,"" Sherman said. ""If Russia walks away, however, it will be quite apparent they were never serious about pursuing diplomacy at all."" On Thursday, the talks will move to a third round at the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, a Cold War-era forum that includes all of the continent's countries, the U.S. and Canada and several in Central Asia. Those talks are expected to yield even fewer results, with 57 member states participating in an open dialogue. The Kremlin has suggested it will make a decision whether it is worth continuing talks following this week's meetings. Putin's spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, on Tuesday said Moscow did not ""see a substantial reason for optimism"" so far but that for now it was not drawing any conclusions.",4,,,,26
2022-01-10,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/us-russia-talks-end-progress/story?id=82180475,"US, Russia talks end with 'no progress': Here's what you need to know","U.S. and Russian officials held over seven hours of talks Monday, but the two sides did not negotiate or appear any closer to a resolution over heightened fears that Russia will attack its neighbor Ukraine. In dueling press conferences after the talks, the top U.S. and Russian diplomats said their meetings were constructive, as they now move on to a second round at NATO's headquarters on Wednesday. But while U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman urged caution and praised the ""frank and forthright"" tone, her counterpart, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov, warned the U.S. is moving too slowly and not taking seriously Moscow's key demands. Whether that sets the stage for genuine negotiations, or whether Russian leader Vladimir Putin is seeking a pretext for war, remains unclear, as Russia pushes to reclaim its Soviet sphere of influence and present its clearest, most fundamental challenge to European security in three decades. Ryabkov said it is impossible for any progress to be made until the U.S. gives legal guarantees Ukraine and Georgia will never join NATO. ""We are fed up with loose talk, half promises. Ukraine and Georgia will never -- never ever -- become members of NATO,"" Ryabkov told reporters afterward, reiterating Russia's top demand, laid out last month in two draft treaties. ""We do not trust the other side. We need ironclad, waterproof, bullet-proof, legally binding guarantees. Not safeguards -- guarantees."" He has said ""no progress"" was made on Russia's central demands and warned the U.S. is failing to understand the urgency of the situation. Even as he denied the approximately 100,000 Russian troops on three sides of Ukraine's borders are preparations for an invasion, Ryabkov again warned Ukraine could spark conflict with a ""provocation,"" ""Enough is enough. The station now is so dangerous and so precarious that we cannot afford any further delays,"" he added. But Sherman made clear that the U.S. will not bend on what it sees as a key principle -- that countries like Ukraine can make their own decisions about joining an alliance. Instead, she said the U.S. offered ""preliminary ideas"" on how to ease tensions and promote transparency between the world's two largest nuclear powers, including reducing missile deployments or military exercises. ""We certainly urged Russia to deescalate, to create an environment that is conducive to the diplomatic track, but we will see,"" she told reporters, While the two sides gained ""a better understanding of each other and each other's priorities and concerns,"" she said, they weren't engaged in negotiations just yet: ""We're not at a point where we're ready to set down texts and begin to go back and forth."" ""We must give diplomacy and dialogue the time and space required to make progress on such complex issues,"" she added, saying the U.S. would ""move as expeditiously as we possibly can,"" but that, ""Negotiations on complex topics like arms control cannot be completed in a matter of days or even weeks."" In contrast, Ryabkov struck a tone of urgency, adding, ""In the coming days there will be more full clarity whether another round will take place, if yes, in what format."" After the NATO-Russia meeting Wednesday, there will be a third round of talks Thursday at the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, a Cold War-era forum that has deployed a war monitor in eastern Ukraine as Russian-led forces battle the Ukrainian government. That war, which has killed approximately 14,000 people and counting, is one way Moscow continues to destabilize its neighbor Ukraine, a former Soviet state that has sought closer ties to the West since protests toppled a pro-Russian oligarch president in 2013. After that revolution, Russia seized Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula and launched the war in the eastern provinces known as Donbas. But the movement of approximately 100,000 Russian troops, along with heavy equipment, has sparked deep concerns about a possible full-scale invasion. Sherman said Monday it was still unclear what Putin had decided but called on Russia to return those forces to their barracks away from Ukraine's borders. Russia has complained for decades about NATO’s expansion to include countries that Moscow dominated as the Soviet Union. Now it has argued that Ukraine has moved too close to the alliance, arguing that NATO military advisors and equipment provided to help Ukraine defend itself in its war with Russia mean it is becoming a de-facto part of it. In 2008, NATO adopted a resolution that stated Ukraine and Georgia would one day become part of the alliance, but there is little support among Western countries for that to happen quickly. Russia views having forced the U.S. to talk about its concerns around Ukraine is an important victory in itself. Ryabkov at the talks suggested that had given grounds for some optimism. ""I don’t consider the situation hopeless,” he continued. “I think the usefulness of the talks in Geneva is mainly that, for the first time, we were able to talk about issues that before existed, but as if behind the scenes.” But he said Russia wants NATO to use its next summit in Madrid this year to renounce the 2008 resolution that opened a path for Ukraine and Georgia to join, a demand that has been seen as a non-starter by the U.S. The U.S. has floated ideas to increase transparency and reduce suspicions between the two sides, including reductions on the deployment of nuclear missiles and other weapons -- although Sherman said the U.S. will not negotiate on the deployment of its forces in Europe, saying it's an issue for only the U.S. and its allies to discuss. ""We will go through all of the discussions this week. We will reflect on them all. I expect that incorporating those, talking with our partners and allies at NATO, at OSCE -- we will then have further conversations with the Russian government and decide on the best way forward,"" she said. For Russia, however, that rejection of NATO membership for Ukraine and Georgia, another former Soviet state where Russian forces currently occupy parts of the country, does not bode well for a diplomatic solution. The question is: If the U.S. and NATO hold firm on that line, will Moscow accept anything else instead, or will its forces attack? An agreement is still ""possible,"" Ryabkov said, but ending NATO's expansion is ""an absolute imperative.""",4,,,,9
2022-01-09,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/secretary-state-antony-blinken-abc-us-open-talking/story?id=82154018,"US open to talking with Russia about missiles, troop exercises: Secretary of State Antony Blinken","Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Sunday that the United States was open to discussing limits on missile deployments and troop exercises in Europe during talks with Russia this week over Ukraine. ""There are confidence-building measures, there are risk-reduction measures, all of which, if done reciprocally, I think can really reduce tensions and address concerns,"" Blinken told told ABC ""This Week"" anchor George Stephanopoulos. And after Russia sent troops to help quell unrest in neighboring Kazakhstan, Blinken did not rule out that events there could come up in talks -- even though Russia has ruled that out. He criticized Kazakhstan's president ordering security forces to shoot to kill protesters. ""That is something I resolutely reject,"" Blinken said. ""The shoot-to-kill order, to the extent it exists, is wrong and should be rescinded."" Delegations from the U.S. and Russia planned to hold talksSunday night and Monday in Geneva, kicking off a critical week of diplomacy between Moscow and the West over Russian President Vladimir Putin menacing neighboring Ukraine. Blinken said it may be possible ""to address whatever legitimate concerns Russia may have."" For example, he said, ""there may be grounds for renewing"" the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty with Russia, from which the Trump administration withdrew and which the U.S. accuses Russia of violating. ""Similarly, there are agreements on the deployment of conventional forces in Europe, on things like the scope and scale of exercises, that, if adhered to reciprocally -- that is, Russia makes good on its commitments, which it's repeatedly violated -- then there are grounds for reducing tensions, creating greater transparency, creating greater confidence, all of which would address concerns that Russia purports to have,"" Blinken said. Stephanopoulos pressed, ""So you're willing to address troop levels, you're willing to address missile deployments, you're willing to address training exercises?"" Blinken said the United States was ""not looking at troop levels."" ""When it comes to the deployment of forces and troop levels, we're not looking at troop levels,"" he said. ""To the contrary, if Russia commits renewed aggression against Ukraine, I think it's a very fair prospect that NATO will reinforce its positions along its eastern flank, the countries that border Russia. ""But when it comes to, for example, the scope and scale of exercises,"" he continued, ""things that were dealt with in the conventional forces in Europe treaty that Russia's been in violation of, those are things that we can look at."" The U.S.-Russia negotiations are expected to be followed by talks between Russia and NATO in Brussels on Wednesday and more discussions between the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe in Vienna on Thursday. The U.S. will participate in those talks, too. As President Joe Biden has threatened in the past, Blinken promised ""massive consequences"" for Russia if it invades Ukraine -- promising they would go beyond those that the West imposed on Russia after it annexed Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula in 2014 -- saying the U.S. and European allies have coordinated on ""economic, financial and other consequences."" But when asked by Stephanopoulos whether he thinks Putin has already made the decision to take control of the Ukraine, Blinken noted he wasn’t sure yet. ""It's clear that we've offered him two paths forward,"" Blinken said. ""One is through diplomacy and dialogue. The other is through deterrents and massive consequences for Russia if it renews its aggression against Ukraine. And we're about to test the proposition of which path President Putin wants to take this week."" And the secretary of state tempered expectations about quick results. ""I don't think we're going to see any breakthroughs next week,"" Blinken said. It would be ""very difficult"" to ""make actual progress,"" he said, as long as ""there's an ongoing escalation, when Russia has a gun to the head of Ukraine with 100,000 troops near its borders, the possibility of doubling that on very short order."" ""If we're seeing de-escalation, if we're seeing a reduction in tensions, that is the kind of environment in which we can make real progress and, again, address concerns, reasonable concerns on both sides,"" Blinken said.",4,,,,26
2022-01-09,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/week-us-russia-diplomatic-talks-kick-off-amid/story?id=82134600,Week of US-Russia diplomatic talks kick off amid Ukraine tension,"Delegations from the U.S. and Russia will hold talks Monday, kicking off a critical week of diplomacy between Moscow and the West over Russian President Vladimir Putin menacing neighboring Ukraine. Ahead of the negotiations, a senior Biden administration official said the United States was open to discussing limits on missile deployments and troop exercises in Europe. For weeks now, Russia has massed nearly 100,000 troops along Ukraine's borders and sharpened its rhetoric to blame Kyiv, the U.S., and NATO for provoking a conflict -- heightening fears in Washington and beyond that Putin is laying the pretext for a full-scale invasion. Russia has denied that, but under the threat of war, it has issued a list of demands in two draft treaties last month that would remake Europe with greater Russian influence -- its most profound challenge to the post-Cold War landscape in three decades. While U.S. officials have said many are nonstarters, like barring Ukraine from NATO membership, President Joe Biden is trying to challenge Moscow on its premise, saying the U.S. and NATO are willing to negotiate if Russia de-escalates tensions. But whether Russia is really willing to engage and walk back from the cliff of conflict - or whether Putin already intends to finish a job he started in 2014 with his seizure of Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula and his start of a war in eastern Ukraine - is an open question, especially after Russia deployed troops to quell protests in Kazakhstan. ""We believe there are areas where we can make progress if Moscow is realistic in its approach. We can't be sure until the talks take place -- that's the nature of diplomacy,"" said a senior State Department official. On Saturday, a senior Biden administration official told reporters that the U.S. and Russia may be able to find agreement on the topics of missile deployments in Europe and the size of troop exercises on either side of Russia's borders with NATO members. Specifically, the official said, Putin does not want offensive missile systems placed in Ukraine, and Biden has already made clear to Putin that ""the United States has no intention of doing that."" The U.S. was also open to discussing the future of certain missile systems in Europe, in the context of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty, from which the Trump administration withdrew and which the U.S. accuses Russia of violating, according to the official. And as troop deployments have ratcheted up tensions in eastern Europe, the official said the U.S. would consider restrictions on troops exercises near the borders Russia shares with NATO members. ""We are willing to explore the possibility of reciprocal restrictions on the size and scope of such exercises,"" the official said, ""including both strategic bombers close to each other's territory and ground-based exercises, as well."" The U.S. would consult its allies and partners before making any commitments related to their security interests, the official said, adding that any commitments would have to be reciprocal -- meaning the U.S. and Russia would ""need to make essentially the same commitment."" The official said bilateral negotiations would primarily take place Monday would there would ""likely"" be an ""initial conversation"" on Sunday night. If Russia and the U.S. are not able to make progress, and if Russia moves ahead with an attack on the former Soviet state, Biden has threatened high-impact sanctions from the U.S. and its allies, including the G7, the European Union, and NATO, as well as NATO deployments to its eastern members and additional arms to Ukraine. But the president has made clear the U.S. will not send troops to defend Ukraine, leaving the ball ultimately in Putin's court. The New York Times on Saturday reported that, if Russia further invades Ukraine, the U.S. and its allies were considering ""cutting off Russia’s largest financial institutions from global transactions, imposing an embargo on American-made or American-designed technology needed for defense-related and consumer industries, and arming insurgents in Ukraine who would conduct what would amount to a guerrilla war against a Russian military occupation, if it comes to that.” The White House's National Security Council declined to comment on the report. After Monday's one-on-one meetings, NATO will hold a meeting with Russia Wednesday -- its first in two and a half years amid icy tensions -- and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, a critical Cold War-era forum that has deployed a war monitor in eastern Ukraine, will convene Thursday. Those other two rounds of talks are equally important in defusing tensions, according to Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who has consistently reiterated the administration's line that they will decide ""nothing about Europe without Europe"" -- adopted from an old Polish saying. ""What's happening in Ukraine is not only about Ukraine. It's part of a broader pattern of destabilizing, dangerous, and often illegal behavior by Moscow,"" Blinken said in a firm speech Friday, rejecting Russia's version of recent history. ""If Russia has legitimate concerns about our actions, the United States, our NATO allies, our OSCE partners are willing to hear them and to try to address them -- if the Kremlin is prepared to reciprocate regarding its own dangerous and destabilizing behavior."" Even after two calls between Biden and Putin in December, U.S. officials are still uncertain if Putin is bluffing and seeking concessions from the U.S. and NATO. But they have said repeatedly they will not compromise on key issues, including Ukraine's security and its potential membership in the alliance. That deep gulf makes it unlikely that Monday's meetings will yield any immediate results -- beyond more talks -- especially because the U.S. has said it will only negotiate on issues between it and Russia, not the threats around Ukraine. ""Hopefully it will result in identifying a few bilateral issues where there is enough common ground to continue discussions and ultimately address together,"" said a second senior State Department official. ""Our hope is that we can follow up this meeting relatively quickly."" When the Russian delegation raises what it has cast as the threat from Ukraine, as it has done publicly now for weeks, the U.S. will listen, the official added, ""because we are wanting to have a dialogue with them."" But ""we are not going to talk above the heads of our European allies and partners,"" they added. Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman will lead the U.S. delegation in Geneva, Switzerland, accompanied by Pentagon and White House National Security Council officials and the top U.S. diplomat for arms control, Bonnie Jenkins. Arms control is one area where U.S. officials have expressed some optimism that they could find common ground with Russia, especially after two previous rounds of talks between Sherman and Jenkins and their counterparts. The day-long talks Monday will be followed by a meeting Wednesday between Russia and NATO -- the first since July 2019. Sherman will lead the U.S. delegation there -- a sign the meeting is equally important to the Biden administration as Monday's one-on-one sessions, according to the first senior State Department official. But even as the administration has repeated its ""nothing about Europe without Europe"" mantra, some European officials have expressed concern about the U.S. and Russia meeting without them. ""There are not two actors alone. It is not just the U.S. and Russia. If we want to talk about security in Europe, Europeans have to be part of the table,"" said Josep Borrell, the E.U.'s top diplomat, during a visit to Ukraine Wednesday. Concerns were particularly heightened Friday after an NBC News report said the U.S. is weighing removing some troops from eastern Europe in exchange for Russia pulling its troops back; what critics cast as appeasement to Putin's threats. But the Biden administration called the report ""erroneous,"" with a third senior State Department official saying they are not weighing troop cuts to Europe, will not discuss U.S. troops in Poland and the Baltics with Russia, and are not compiling a list of potential troop cuts for the talks. State Department officials went even further -- warning U.S. allies that after Monday's talks conclude, Russia is likely to lie about what took place in the meetings. ""We fully expect that the Russian side will make public comments following the meeting on Monday that will not reflect the true nature of the discussions that took place. We would urge our allies and partners to view those comments with extreme skepticism and to continue their ongoing discussions and coordination with the United States,"" the first senior State Department official said. With tension and distrust so high, and expectations low, the administration is being warned not to concede any ground to Putin's negotiators after Moscow has escalated the situation to a crisis point. ""The war talk in Moscow may be a sort of psychological operation to soften up the West, frighten West Europeans, and divide Putin's western adversaries so that a lesser Russian attack -- seizing another slice of Ukraine rather than a full-scale invasion, or stationing Russian forces along the Polish frontier, or 'mere' cyber attacks and physical sabotage in Kyiv -- is greeted with relief and thus accepted,"" wrote Daniel Fried, a retired U.S. ambassador who served as the top U.S. diplomat for Europe, ambassador to Poland, and top sanctions official. Threading that needle between addressing ""whatever is legitimate in Moscow's long litany of grievance"" and pushing ""back against Putin's aggression and pretentions to resume Russia's domination of Europe's eastern half"" will not be easy, Fried added. But it is a critical moment in the future of the international system the U.S. midwifed in the 20th century, with the lives of many on the line, especially Ukrainians. ""The people of Ukraine has been fighting this war for seven years now, and we know how to fight and we know how to win,"" Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba told ABC News last year. ""This is our land, our soil, and we will be defending it. But it's much easier to defend it when you have friends and allies in the back."" ABC News' Ben Gittleson contributed reporting.",4,,,,26
2022-01-06,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/US/fbi-arrests-man-allegedly-spied-egyptian-presidents-opponents/story?id=82113836,FBI arrests man who allegedly spied on Egyptian president's opponents,"An Egyptian American has been charged with acting as an illegal agent of Egypt as he ""tracked and obtained information regarding political opponents"" of the Egyptian president, federal prosecutors in New York said. It's the latest example of an autocratic leader extending their grip beyond their borders to quash political dissent -- a hand that in recent years has even extended into the U.S., according to some analysts. Pierre Girgis, 39, ""operated at the direction and control of multiple employees of the Egyptian government,"" according to the criminal complaint, as he spied on critics of President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, the Egyptian general who seized power in 2013. Sisi has overseen a widespread crackdown on human rights in Egypt, which is among the least free countries in the world, according to the think tank Freedom House. Sisi's government has imprisoned tens of thousands of political prisoners, criminalized expressions of dissent and deployed security forces with impunity, according to human rights groups. ""At the behest of Egyptian officials, Girgis' alleged prohibited conduct included attempting to covertly gather non-public intelligence about the activities of political opponents of Egypt's president, and attempting to gain access for foreign officials to attend law enforcement-only trainings in Manhattan,"" U.S. attorney Damian Williams said in a statement. Girgis is charged with acting as an agent of a foreign government without notifying the attorney general of the United States and with conspiracy. The Egyptian Embassy in Washington, D.C., has not yet responded to a request for comment. The government has previously denied harassing dissidents or defended arrests as critical to national security, and Sisi once claimed his government held no political prisoners. Critics, such as the Freedom Initiative, have alleged that Sisi's repressive tactics now extend beyond Egypt's borders to target dissidents overseas. ""Mr. Girgis' activities are not isolated. Egypt has engaged in a pattern of intimidating and harassing rights defenders, journalists and the families of political prisoners in the U.S. for years,"" said Allison McManus, research director of the human rights organization founded by Mohamed Soltan. Soltan, an Egyptian American, spent nearly two years in prison for protesting Sisi's 2013 seizure of power. He was tortured in prison, he said, and went on hunger strike to demand his release, but after being returned to the U.S., his outspoken advocacy has resulted in Egyptian authorities harassing his family, he claimed. Soltan's father has been arrested by Egyptian authorities and has had no communication with his family since, according to Soltan, while five cousins have been arrested and released twice now. The Freedom Initiative alleged in a May 2021 report that at least a dozen American citizens have had family members back in Egypt detained throughout 2020, five of which were in direct response to their political activity in the U.S. The State Department declined to comment on Girgis' case, saying it is an active law enforcement matter. But spokesperson Ned Price told ABC News, ""We are seeking to hold to account countries that would pursue dissidents, that would undertake such activity extraterritorially."" Critics say that little has been done to punish Egypt, one of the United States' key Middle East allies and a major recipient of military aid. The Biden administration withheld $130 million in military aid last fall, which human rights groups in a joint statement said ""undermines the human rights of Egypt’s citizens and further erodes the standing of the United States."" Examples of this kind of ""extraterritorial"" activity by autocratic governments have grown in recent years, too. The Saudi government ordered the murder of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi at its consulate in Turkey, Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko grounded a Ryanair flight to arrest a dissident blogger on board, and Russian agents poisoned former spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter in the United Kingdom. Saudi Arabia claimed it was a rogue operation, while Russia denied any responsibility for Skripal's poisoning. This is also not the first case of a foreign agent spying on dissidents in the U.S. Last summer, the Department of Justice accused four Iranian citizens, including one intelligence agent, of attempting to kidnap activist and writer Masih Alinejad from her New York apartment. Federal prosecutors said the suspects were directed by the Iranian government to bring Alinejad back to Tehran because of her criticism of the government. It's unclear what Girgis' information was being used for, if at all, but an Egyptian official allegedly made its value to the government clear in encrypted communications sent in 2018, according to the criminal complaint. ""You do a lot of good things,"" one message from an unnamed Egyptian official said, according to the complaint. ""You have become an important source for them to collect information."" In a 2019 message, Girgis and the same Egyptian official reportedly discussed an upcoming trip of certain Egyptian officials to the United States. ""Tell me what you want me to do,"" Girgis asked his handler, according to the criminal complaint. The Egyptian official responded by inquiring about Girgis' relationship with a particular U.S. law enforcement officer. ""Ask [the U.S. law enforcement officer] for something,"" the official reportedly said. ""We want you to find out if there are any police trainings happening in Manhattan in the coming days, and if so, who are the people in charge of these trainings? We would like to attend."" Girgis surrendered Thursday morning to the FBI and was due to make an initial appearance in Manhattan federal court later in the day. It wasn’t immediately clear if he had arranged a lawyer.",20,,,,3
2021-12-30,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/biden-putin-talk-thursday-amid-heightened-tensions-ukraine/story?id=81988087,"Biden, Putin hold call amid heightened tensions over Ukraine","President Joe Biden spoke with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday -- their second conversation this month amid heightened fears of a full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The call, which the Biden administration said comes at Putin's request, was the latest effort to defuse those tensions diplomatically. But tens of thousands of Russian troops remain near Ukraine's borders, and bellicose rhetoric from Russian officials and state propaganda have Western officials on edge still. The U.S. and European allies have threatened unprecedented economic penalties for Moscow if it attacks Ukraine, nearly eight years after its forces seized the Crimean Peninsula and sparked a war in Ukraine's eastern provinces known as Donbas. Sanctions and other penalties have not brought that conflict to an end, with approximately 14,000 people killed and Russian-led separatists still fighting Ukrainian forces. U.S. officials say it's unclear if Putin has decided to attack again in an all-out invasion, but Biden has already made clear U.S. forces will not come to Kyiv's aid on the battlefield. Instead, the Biden administration is hoping deterrence and diplomacy will stop Putin. A senior administration official said they ""cannot speak to why the Russian side has requested the call,"" but added both leaders believe there is ""genuine value in direct leader to leader engagement."" ""I think we are at a moment of crisis and have been for some weeks now given the Russian build-up and that it will take a high level of engagement to address this and to try to find a path of de-escalation,"" the official told reporters Wednesday. In addition to the leaders' call, U.S. and Russian diplomats will meet on Jan. 10, the two sides confirmed Tuesday, to discuss stated security concerns on either side. ""Open lines of dialogue, open lines of diplomacy have the potential to be constructive as we seek to de-escalate the potential for conflict in and around Ukraine,"" State Department spokesperson Ned Price said of the talks. After those meetings, NATO will hold a meeting with Russia on Jan. 12, while the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, a key security forum that has deployed a war monitor in eastern Ukraine, will hold a session Jan. 13. ""The Biden administration continues to engage in extensive diplomacy with our European allies and partners, consulting and coordinating on a common approach in response to Russia's military build-up on the border with Ukraine,"" Emily Horne, Biden's National Security Council spokesperson, said in a statement. But some European allies have called for greater involvement. The European Union ""must be involved in these negotiations,"" its top diplomat, Josep Borrell, told the German newspaper Die Welt. ""It's about us. This is not simply the case for two states, i.e. America and Russia, or NATO and Russia -- even if Moscow imagines it,"" he added in the interview, published Wednesday. Secretary of State Antony Blinken has said repeatedly the U.S. will not negotiate any arrangement about European security without first consulting European allies -- speaking again to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy Wednesday, just as the two spoke before Biden and Putin's first call this month. He reiterated ""unwavering"" U.S. support for Ukraine, per Price, and ""discussed efforts to peacefully resolve the conflict in eastern Ukraine and upcoming diplomatic engagements with Russia"" -- a nod to both Thursday's call and the Jan. 10 meetings. Zelenskiy tweeted that he was assured of ""full"" U.S. support ""in countering Russian aggression."" U.S. officials have already publicly rebuked Russia's demand heading into talks -- that Ukraine be barred from NATO membership, saying the Western alliance's military activity in former Soviet states threatens Russia. But other items on Russia's public demands are not ""unacceptable"" and could be addressed through diplomacy, Blinken, Price and others have said -- provided that Russia de-escalate as well by pulling back its forces from Ukraine's borders. Instead, while Russian state media reported Monday that more than 10,000 were withdrawn, the senior administration official said there's still a ""significant Russian troop presence in and around the border."" The ominous language from Russian officials has also continued. Putin himself said Sunday that he is weighing ""diverse"" military and technical options if Russia's demands aren't addressed. Amid that heightened threat, the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv is making ""emergency preparations"" in case it evacuates non-emergency personnel or diplomats' families, according to internal emails obtained by ABC News. The embassy is seeking additional security staff to temporarily fill in next month, as the ""permanent staff continue Emergency Preparations in case of Authorized or Ordered Departure"" -- when an embassy allows diplomats' families and non-emergency personnel to relocate because of a threat. A State Department spokesperson confirmed Wednesday they are ""conducting normal contingency planning, as we always do, in the event the security situation severely deteriorates."" But they told ABC News they are not ""currently considering evacuations of U.S. government personnel or American citizens from Ukraine."" Russian presidential aide Yuri Ushakov said that during Biden's call with Putin, Biden assured that the U.S. is not going to deploy offensive strike weapons in Ukraine. ""President Biden has clearly stated that the United States does not intend to deploy offensive strike weapons in Ukraine. Our president noted that this is one of the key points that are just included in our documents that we have handed over to the Americans and on which we want to continue substantive negotiations,"" Ushakov told reporters after a telephone conversation between the presidents. According to Ushakov, Putin said Russia will seek guarantees of its security. ""Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin outlined in detail the basic principles that were laid down in the documents we submitted, and stressed that negotiations on these three tracks are important for us, of course, but the main thing is that we need a result, and we will achieve a result in the form of ensuring guaranteed security of Russia,"" Ushakov told reporters. ""The US President, in principle, agreed with this point of view and reacted quite logically and quite seriously."" Earlier this month, the State Department updated its travel advisory for Ukraine to include a warning about ""increased threats from Russia."" The advisory had been at the agency's highest level, ""Level 4: Do Not Travel,"" for months because of the COVID-19 pandemic, but it now warns, ""U.S. citizens should be aware of reports that Russia is planning for significant military action against Ukraine."" White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki issued a short statement Thursday following Biden's call with Putin, saying Biden ""urged Russia to de-escalate tensions with Ukraine,"" and ""made clear that the United States and its allies and partners will respond decisively if Russia further invades Ukraine."" ""President Biden also expressed support for diplomacy, starting early next year with the bilateral Strategic Stability Dialogue, at NATO through the NATO-Russia Council, and at the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. President Biden reiterated that substantive progress in these dialogues can occur only in an environment of de-escalation rather than escalation,"" Psaki said. Also on Thursday, a senior White House official gave a readout of the call between Biden and Putin, saying the tone was ""serious and substantive."" According to the official, Biden outlined two paths forward -- all depending on how Russia chooses to proceed. ""President Biden laid out two paths. Two aspects of the US approach that will really depend on Russia's actions in the period ahead. One is a path of diplomacy, leading toward a de-escalation of the situation, and the other is a path that's more focused on deterrence, including serious costs and consequences should Russia choose to proceed with a further invasion of Ukraine,"" the official said. ""Those costs include economic costs include adjustments and augmentations of NATO force posture in allied countries and include additional assistance to Ukraine to enable it to further defend itself in its territory. as we've laid out previously,"" the official added. When asked if Putin had offered any further clarity on if he had made a decision on whether or not to further invade Ukraine, the official said there were ""certainly no declarations to intention"" in the conversation, but the U.S. will continue to monitor the situation to be ready for whatever Putin decides.

2021-12-28,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/russia-closes-human-rights-group-recorded-stalin-era/story?id=81968455,Russia shuts down human rights group that recorded Stalin-era crimes,"MOSCOW -- In what has been described as a watershed moment for President Vladimir Putin's crackdown on dissent, Russia's Supreme Court on Tuesday ordered the closure of Memorial International, the country's oldest human rights organization and the main chronicler of mass crimes committed under the Soviet Union. Memorial was founded in 1987 by leading Soviet dissidents, including the Nobel prize-winning scientist Andrey Sakharov. As one of Russia's first human rights organizations, it established an archive of records on the mass executions and imprisonments in Soviet gulag camps under Joseph Stalin. The organization's efforts to record Soviet oppression and commemorate its victims were seen as a key symbol of Russia's move toward democracy, and the country's first democratically elected president, Boris Yeltsin, was a member. In present-day Russia, the group had also become a key defender of those facing political persecution. At a hearing in Moscow on Tuesday, Supreme Court Judge Alla Nazarova upheld a request from prosecutors to close down Memorial for allegedly violating Russia's so-called ""foreign agents"" law, which has been used to target media and human rights organizations critical of authorities. Tuesday's ruling was condemned in Russia and internationally as politically motivated and part of a broader campaign targeting human rights groups under Putin. But the move against Memorial is seen as having unique significance, representing a turning point in the Putin government's efforts to rehabilitate the USSR and to silence discussion of the darkest chapters of its history. The U.S. embassy in Moscow condemned the ruling, with Ambassador John Sullivan calling it ""a blatant and tragic attempt to suppress freedom of expression and erase history."" The decision to close Memorial comes amid an unprecedented crackdown dissent under Putin over the past two years that has seen many prominent opposition activists jailed or forced abroad. Independent media has also been squeezed. ""It's an outrageous assault on the jugular of Russia's civil society,"" wrote Rachel Denber, Human Rights Watch's deputy director for Europe and Central Asia, of Memorial's closure. ""Even when authorities have banned key opposition movement, jailed opposition figures, pushed independent media to the margins… today's ruling is heralding a new era of repression."" Russian prosecutors accused Memorial officials of violating the law by failing to mark some publications with text identifying themselves as ""foreign agents."" In his closing arguments Tuesday, prosecutor Aleksey Zhafyarov told the court Memorial was creating ""a false image of the USSR as a terrorist state"" and was seeking to rehabilitate ""Nazi criminals."" Memorial said in a statement that the alleged violations of the foreign agent law were only a ""formal"" pretext for closing the organization. ""But today in court was at last named not the formal grounds, but the true reason for the liquidation of Memorial International: the General Prosecutor claims that we are incorrectly interpreting Soviet history,"" it said. ""The Supreme Court's decision confirmed once again that the history of political terror, organised and directed by state power, remains for Russia not an academic question of interest only for specialists, but an urgent problem of the present,"" Memorial wrote. A lawyer for Memorial, Maria Eismont, said it would appeal the ruling, even taking the case to the European Court of Human Rights if necessary. The group pledged to find legal ways to continue its work. ""Memorial is not just an organisation. Memorial is the need of Russia's citizens for the truth about its tragic past, about millions of people's fates. And no one can 'liquidate' that need,"" it said. Putin does not deny that crimes were committed by the Soviet Union, but authorities recently have tried to downplay them and instead embraced a positive view of the USSR as a source of national pride. Over the past five years, authorities have imposed greater control over Russia's Soviet history, seeking to glorify it and, in particular, its victory in World War II. During court hearings against Memorial, a prosecutor told the court, ""Why should we, descendants of the victors, be ashamed and repentant instead of taking pride in our glorious past? Probably, someone is paying Memorial for this."" In court Tuesday, Memorial's acting director Elena Zhemkova noted that until recently Russia's government had valued the group's work, including it in expert commissions. ""Memorial had been doing the same work for 32 years,"" Denber from Human Rights Watch wrote. ""They haven't changed. What's changed, obviously, is the Russian gov[ernment]."" The outcry was joined by rights groups around the world. The Auschwitz Museum that commemorates Nazi atrocities at the concentration camp tweeted a quote in Russian from its Dr. Piotr M. A. Cywiński: ""A power that is afraid of memory, will never be able to achieve democratic maturity."" Memorial has faced growing pressure in recent years, with its offices sometimes attacked and some of its volunteers targeted in criminal cases. In 2020, Yury Dmitriyev, a member of Memorial and historian who helped uncover Stalin-era mass graves, was jailed for 13 years on charges of sexual abuse that were widely criticized as politically motivated. On Monday, just a day before the Memorial ruling, a court in Dmitriev's home region of Karelia added two more years to his sentence. Vasily Starostin, a volunteer researcher with Memorial, told ABC on Tuesday that the order to close Memorial was ""a huge blow"". ""Because Memorial represented from the start a move to a more democratic and liberal society,"" he said. ""I think symbolically speaking this whole story, it's a huge set back for our society and the way it works.""",45,,,,3
2021-12-27,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/high-risk-armed-conflict-ukraine-russian-defense-ministry/story?id=81957818,"'High risk' of armed conflict over Ukraine, Russian defense ministry warns","Russia's deputy defense minister warned foreign ambassadors of a ""high risk"" of conflict between the country and its neighbor Ukraine -- one day after President Vladimir Putin threatened ""diverse"" military and technical responses if the West doesn't address his stated concerns. These latest messages from Moscow are the kind that have had U.S. and other western officials on edge that Putin will launch an assault on Ukraine, even after President Joe Biden warned him doing so would bring massive penalties. The Biden administration has repeatedly called for diplomacy with Russia to de-escalate tensions and end the war in Ukraine's eastern provinces, nearly eight years after Russian troops armed separatist forces in a conflict that continues to simmer and claim lives. But Russia's demands for security guarantees, including that Ukraine be barred from joining NATO, have been called ""unacceptable"" by U.S. officials -- possibly purposefully so, so that Russia can later claim to have given diplomacy a shot. Russia has said it has no plans to invade but demanded the U.S., NATO, and Ukraine take seriously its concerns. ""We didn't make the proposals just to see them blocked in terms of the diplomatic process, but for the purpose of reaching a negotiated diplomatic result that would be fixed in legally binding documents. We will aim at this,"" Putin said Sunday. His Deputy Defense Minister Alexander Fomin blamed NATO again Monday for provoking conflict by sending warships and reconnaissance planes to back Ukraine. That echoes a statement last week by his boss, Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu, who claimed Ukraine, with U.S. mercenary help, is preparing a chemical weapons attack. ""The alliance has recently switched to the practice of direct provocations accompanied by the high risk of turning into armed confrontation,"" Fomin said during a meeting that included envoys from 14 NATO countries. It's the kind of false pretext for an invasion that U.S. officials and analysts have warned Russia may create to justify an invasion. ""Russia is ostensibly outraged by a crisis of their own making,"" said Mick Mulroy, a senior Trump administration Pentagon official and ABC News national security analyst. ""It was Russia that put around 175,000 troops on the border and threatened to invade again if its demands were not met -- 'Do what I ask, or I will attack and occupy a sovereign country against all international norms.'"" The estimated number of Russian troops near Ukraine have ranged from 60,000 to over 100,000, with one leaked U.S. intelligence document warning Russia could be prepared to swiftly deploy as many as 175,000. U.S. officials have cited those troop movements, along with Russian propaganda attacks on Ukraine, which they say have increased tenfold, and bellicose rhetoric as evidence of a possible invasion. But diplomacy could stave off war. The U.S. and Russia have agreed to hold talks in January to address each side's concerns, along with talks between NATO and Russia and meetings at the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, according to U.S. officials. The OSCE, a key security forum, has deployed a war monitor in eastern Ukraine for years as the conflict has taken some 14,000 lives. After coordinating a meeting between the Ukrainian government and the Russian-controlled separatists last week, the OSCE declared Thursday that both sides showed a ""strong determination to fully adhere"" to a July 2020 ceasefire agreement. The statement was heralded by Biden's National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan and the State Department, whose spokesperson said, ""We hope the resultant peace will create the diplomatic space necessary to de-escalate regional tensions and provide a positive atmosphere for further discussion."" There has been no ""resultant peace."" Three Ukrainian soldiers were wounded in shelling that last for hours on Sunday. There had been five times more ceasefire violations this month than last December, according to the OSCE. But there was some notable Russian troop movements, according to state-run Interfax news agency, which reported that more than 10,000 troops pulled back from near Ukraine's borders after military drills. The Kremlin also said Monday that it made sense to engage NATO directly about its security concerns, in addition to the U.S. Whether that is yet a sign for hope that war can be avoided is unclear. U.S. officials have said it's still unknown whether Putin has decided to invade, with tens of thousands of troops still in the area, including in Crimea, the Ukrainian peninsula Russia invaded and seized in 2014.",4,,,,26
2021-12-23,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/International/tensions-rise-russia-ukraine-putin-places-blame-west/story?id=81913009,"Amid Ukraine invasion fears, Putin says West must give NATO guarantees","MOSCOW -- Amid fears Russia might invade Ukraine, Russia’s president Vladimir Putin has again repeated demands for guarantees from Western countries that NATO will not expand in eastern Europe, but also expressed hope that negotiations with the Biden administration in January could allow the two sides to “move forward."" Putin offered the mixed messages on Thursday during his marathon end-of-year press conference in Moscow, making menacing accusations against Ukraine but also sounding more hopeful notes around the possibility for negotiation. Western countries are alarmed that Russia may be preparing a renewed invasion into Ukraine this winter, amid a build up of tens of thousands of Russian troops on its border. Putin has demanded the U.S. and NATO give legal guarantees the alliance will not expand further and withdraw NATO troop deployments from eastern Europe. The Biden administration has called those demands non-starters but has agreed to hold talks with Russia over its concerns. Putin on Thursday said those talks would take place in Geneva in January and said Russia had seen a “positive reaction” from the U.S. to its demands to negotiate. “I hope that the first positive reaction and the announced possible start of work in the near future, in the first days of January, will allow us to move forward,” Putin said. Putin said Russia was forced to confront NATO and Ukraine now to prevent the country potentially becoming a base for NATO missiles in the future. “And so we put the question directly: there must be no movement of NATO further to the east,” he said. “The ball is in their court. They must answer us something."" The U.S. and NATO countries have rejected Russia’s demands for a veto on NATO expansion, seeing them as an attempt by the Kremlin to have formal recognition for a sphere of influence over Ukraine. Analysts and Western officials have been trying to understand whether the Russian build up is a negotiating tactic or signals a real readiness to invade. Putin’s comments on Thursday did little to move the needle. He said Russia did not want conflict but alleged there Ukraine might be preparing a military operation to re-take the Russian-controlled separatist regions in its east, saying Kyiv had tried to do it twice before in the past. “They keep telling us: war, war, war,” Putin said. “There is an impression that, maybe, they are preparing for the third military operation and are warning us in advance: do not intervene, do not protect these people. But if you do intervene and protect them, there will be new sanctions. Perhaps, we should prepare for that."" Analysts fear Russia might use the accusation of a Ukrainian attack as pretext to launch its own invasion. There are no signs Ukraine’s government is preparing such an assault, which would risk an overwhelming Russian response. Russia last week published two draft treaties listing its demands from the U.S. and NATO. The proposals would limit NATO troops and military infrastructure to the countries where they were based before 1997, when the key eastern European members joined. The Biden administration immediately rejected Russia’s demands limiting which countries can join NATO. But it has said it is ready to hold talks with Moscow about some of the other proposals, which are linked to arms control for example. Putin spoke at length and angrily about NATO’s expansion eastward since the end of the Cold War, a grievance he has long held. Asked by a journalist from Britain’s Sky News on Thursday if he would guarantee Russia will not invade Ukraine, Putin said it was Russia that needed guarantees from Western countries over NATO. “What guarantees must we give you? You must give us guarantees. Right here and right now!” Putin said. ABC News' Tanya Stukalova contributed to this report.",4,,,,26
2021-12-17,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/International/russia-makes-sweeping-demands-security-guarantees-us-amid/story?id=81821816,Russia makes sweeping demands for security guarantees from US amid Ukraine tensions,"Russia published a list of sweeping new security guarantees it wants from the United States and NATO on Friday -- including a promise not to expand the alliance -- staking out demands for de-escalating the crisis it has stoked around Ukraine. The radical proposals would rewrite the post-Cold War security order in Europe, obliging the U.S. and NATO to commit to not admitting any new members, including Ukraine, but also effectively prohibiting any NATO military activity in Eastern Europe and most of the former Soviet Union. The demands were presented in two draft treaties that Russia's foreign ministry published on Friday, with Russia saying it had passed them to the Biden administration earlier this week. But the U.S. and NATO countries have already previously ruled out Russian demands for a veto on the alliance's expansion and on Friday a senior Biden administration official immediately rejected the two key Russian proposals to bar Ukraine from ever joining or NATO expanding farther eastward. ""We will not compromise on key principles on which European security is built,"" the administration official told reporters, speaking on the condition of anonymity. ""All countries have the right to decide their own future and their own foreign policy, free from outside interference, and that goes for Ukraine and it also goes for NATO allies and the alliance itself,"" the senior administration official said, adding President Joe Biden made that clear to Russian President Vladimir Putin during their call last week. Russia made the proposals against the backdrop of its military buildup near Ukraine, where the U.S. says Russia has massed over 100,000 troops, with the implicit threat it could use force if its demands are not met. Western countries fear Putin may be preparing a new major military incursion against Ukraine and have been trying to understand whether the Russian leader is really prepared to escalate the conflict this winter. Friday's proposals addressed a grievance the Kremlin has nurtured for nearly three decades about NATO's expansion since the Cold War -- into what Moscow views as its sphere of influence. The Russian draft treaties call for NATO to remove any troops or weapons from countries that joined the alliance after 1997, meaning most of Eastern Europe, including Poland, the Baltic states and Balkan countries. It also calls for the U.S. and Russia to refrain from deploying troops in areas where they could be perceived as a threat to each countries' national security, and a ban on sending their aircraft and warships into areas where they could strike each other's territory. The treaty would also ban the deployment of intermediate-range missiles in Europe. The limits on NATO in Eastern Europe are seen as a non-starter by most experts. Most analysts in Moscow believe the Kremlin itself is aware that the proposals are unrealistic. Some said that rather than real goals, they may represent an opening gambit aimed at winning some concessions. ""This is a bargaining position -- [the Kremlin] is trying to get some degree of partial acceptance,"" Andrey Kortunov, head of the Russian International Affairs Council, told The Moscow Times. The senior Biden administration official said that while it rejected out of hand the proposed limits on NATO membership for Ukraine and others, it was reviewing the other Russian proposals, hinting it was possible there might be some areas for discussion. The official noted that several of the issues raised by Russia -- arms control for example -- were already being dealt with in different talks between the U.S. and Russia. The official said the U.S. would respond with a ""more concrete"" proposal to the Russians next week after consulting with allies, but added it will include a list of their own concerns ""about Russia's posture and behavior."" But other analysts found the unrealistic nature of Russia's demands disturbing, interpreting them as perhaps a sign the Kremlin is laying the groundwork now to justify an invasion that it will paint as the result of failed negotiations. ""I don't see this as something aimed at a productive negotiation, even if some parts of this could have been discussed and considered privately,"" Vladimir Frolov, a former Russian diplomat and current foreign affairs commentator, told ABC News. Dmitry Trenin, the director of the Carnegie Moscow Center, wrote on Twitter that Russia publishing the demands now ""may suggest that Moscow (rightly) considers their acceptance by west unlikely."" That means Russia is more likely to use military force to ensure they are realized, he said. Russia's buildup has not stopped since Biden and Putin's call last week, with satellite imagery showing vehicles and equipment continuing to appear at new sites near Ukraine. Most experts believe the Russian troops will not withdraw while the Kremlin continues its diplomatic push for concessions.",4,,,,26
2021-12-12,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/International/front-line-eastern-ukraine-biden-putin-talk/story?id=81677077,"On the front line of eastern Ukraine, as Biden and Putin talk","AVDIIVKA, Ukraine -- As President Joe Biden called Russian President Vladimir Putin this week, warning him against launching a renewed invasion of Ukraine, Ukrainian soldiers were going through an ordinary day on the front in eastern Ukraine. Hunkered down in their positions in shell-shattered factories and muddy trenches, they kept watch while every hour or so the sound of small-arms fire popped from the lines of Russian-backed separatists a few dozen yards away. The main purpose of the call for Biden was to try to deter Putin from launching a new incursion, amid fears over the buildup of tens of thousands of Russian troops on Ukraine's eastern border. But in positions on the edge of Avdiivka, an industrial town in Ukraine's Donbas region where Ukrainian troops have been dug in opposite the Russian-backed separatist lines for seven years, the call seemed to attract only mild attention. Although they acknowledged uncertainty about it, there was little sense the Ukrainian soldiers were bracing for an imminent invasion. Instead, the troops there were focused on the daily dangers of the conflict that has not died despite a 2015 peace agreement, remaining for years -- a slow, bleeding wound on Ukraine's eastern edge. Several soldiers told ABC News reporters this week that they don't see a renewed massive Russian offensive as likely for now, though they said they needed to be ready all the same. Oleksiy Kasyanov, a 22-year-old lieutenant from the 25th Airborne Brigade, said he was aware of the Russian build-up but said he thinks it's mostly posturing. ""I think it's a show,"" he said, standing in a trench where his unit is deployed for the next six months. More senior Ukrainian military officials have expressed greater concerns. The head of Ukraine's military intelligence service has warned Russia may be preparing to invade in late January. U.S. intelligence has expressed similar concerns, briefing U.S. newspapers last week that the Kremlin may be planning a multi-front offensive then involving up to 175,000 troops. U.S. officials have said they do not think Putin has yet decided to use force or if the build-up is just a ploy to intimidate. But they fear the possibility of invasion is now higher than any time since 2015. The conflict in eastern Ukraine began shortly after Russia annexed Crimea in 2014 and then armed and directed separatist paramilitaries who seized control in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. Russian regular units later intervened on a large scale as the paramilitaries suffered setbacks. A peace agreement in 2015 ended large-scale fighting but never resolved the conflict. Instead, it settled into the smoldering stand-off, where the Ukrainians and Russian-backed forces eye each other from trenches and exchange sporadic fire along the line most days. The war has displaced over two million people and killed over 10,000 since 2014. Fifty-five Ukrainian soldiers have died this year already, with many more injured, according to Ukraine's defense ministry. Separatist authorities announced an end to a ceasefire earlier this year, and casualties have since ticked up, according to a UN human rights monitoring mission to the region. It found between February and July, 15 civilians were killed and 47 injured, a 50% increase from last year. Western countries worry that Russia is now ready to break up the current deadlock with a major incursion if it fails to get concessions from the U.S. and Ukraine over NATO support for the country and to implement more of the 2015 peace agreement. Putin has denied Russia is preparing any type of invasion, accusing Western countries and Ukraine of provoking tensions. On the ground, Ukrainian officers said the situation along the front felt as usual for now. Brigadier General Anatoly Shevchenko, deputy commander for Ukraine's Joint Forces, said that military activity along the frontline had increased slightly but ""not a lot."" He said, for now, Ukraine had not detected a substantial increase of regular Russian troops within the separatist territories, saying the buildup was mostly taking place in Russia. ""We are ready for anything,"" Shevchenko said. The industrial zone on the edge of Avdiivka, only a few miles from the separatists' de-facto capital Donetsk, saw some of the heaviest fighting in 2014 and continues to be one of the most active points on the front. Inside a devastated factory, shredded by tank and artillery shells, Ukrainian troops have erected fortifications of sandbags and other wreckage. A network of CCTV cameras pointed at no man's land watch for movement. Ukrainian officers said most of the fighters on the other side were local, but that Russian military advisors and snipers were working among them. They said Ukrainian troops were allowed only to fire if fired on, out of concern that Russia might use any incident as a pretext for launching a broader attack. Biden and Putin's call on Tuesday offered little clue whether the crisis would now calm. Colonel Yaroslav Melnychuk, a spokesperson for Ukraine's military, expressed hope Biden's call with Putin might ease the situation. He said he longed for peace but had little hope it would come soon. ""Everyone dreams of that,"" he said. ""But the reality is that we have been doing this for eight years. We have to be ready for anything.""",4,,,,11

""I think you could anticipate that in the event of an invasion, the need to reinforce the confidence and reassurance of our NATO allies and our eastern flank allies would be real, and the United States would be prepared to provide that kind of reassurance,"" a senior administration official promised on a call with reporters. ""That's just sort of applying the lessons of 2014 to 2021."" Notably, the official wouldn’t specify whether that ""reassurance"" would come in the form of sanctions, U.S. forces, capabilities, or all of the above, nor what the hair trigger is for the support. ""I'm not suggesting that today, we have a, particular, you know, tick tock on that, only to say that we are working through the prudent planning of what we would have to do in the event of such an escalation and how we would have to ensure the security of our NATO allies in that context. I would not go, I'm not saying anything further than that,” the official added. The official wouldn’t go so far as to say outright that President Biden will warn President Putin the U.S. military could be used if the Russian military moves into Ukraine. ""I don't want to use a public press call to talk about the particular sensitive challenges that President Biden will lay out for President Putin,"" the official said. ""But I would say that the United States is not seeking to end up in a circumstance in which the focus of our countermeasures is the direct use of American military force, as opposed to a combination of support for the Ukrainian military, strong economic countermeasures, and substantial increase in support and capability to our NATO allies to ensure they remain safe."" In short: Biden will warn Putin there will be consequences for an invasion into Ukraine. “Obviously President Biden will raise these concerns. He will make clear that there will be very real cost should Russia choose to proceed, but he will also make clear that there is an effective way forward with respect to diplomacy,” the SAO said. The administration’s preferred option for response to any Russian aggression would be a series of economic sanctions in concert with European partners, and the SAO warned those would be ""severe."" ""We believe that we have a path forward that would involve substantial economic countermeasures by both the Europeans and the United States that would impose significant and severe economic harm on the Russian economy, should they choose to proceed. I'm not going to get into the specific details of that, but we believe that there is a way forward here that will allow us to send a clear message to Russia, that there will be genuine and meaningful and enduring costs to choosing to go forward should they choose to go forward with a military escalation in Ukraine,” the official warned. The official claimed the U.S. has no confirmation that Putin has issued an order to advance. But U.S. officials are seeing troop movements, and increased disinformation that attempts to portray Ukraine as the aggressor, concerning developments that also preceded the 2014 invasion of Crimea. ""The troop movements have involved the addition of battalion tactical groups around Ukraine in. multiple different geographies around those borders to the south, the West, and to the northeast as well. And we have also seen as Secretary Blinken said last week, a significant spike in social media activity pushing anti-Ukrainian propaganda, which is approaching levels that we last saw in the lead up to Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2014,” the official said. Given the administration’s commitment to providing backup for allies, the official said Biden will speak with key European partners Monday to make sure he goes into the call with a foundation of solidarity. Secretary Blinken will be speaking with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky ahead of the Putin call, and President Biden will call Zelensky Tuesday to provide a readout of his conversation with Putin, the official told reporters.",4,,,,4

In the most urgent warning yet, Blinken said the U.S. and its NATO allies would impose a steep cost on Moscow if it attacked its neighbor. But that cost would be economic and political, with the top U.S. diplomat threatening ""a range of high-impact economic measures that we've refrained from using in the past."" But he and NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg stopped short of mentioning the use of force to defend Ukraine, which is not a member of the military alliance. ""We don't know whether President Putin has made the decision to invade. We do know he's putting in place the capacity to do so in short order,"" Blinken said -- the clearest statement to date of Western worries of an invasion, as Russia masses approximately 100,000 troops, along with heavy equipment, near Ukraine's border. Blinken will meet his Russian counterpart, Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, on the sidelines of a summit on European security Thursday, as well as Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba. It will be the latest high-level engagement between the U.S. and Russia amid heightened concern about Russia threatening Ukraine. President Joe Biden deployed his CIA Director Bill Burns to Moscow last month to convey U.S. concerns in person, Blinken said, declining to specify whether he would lay out precisely what those ""high-impact"" sanctions would be with Lavrov. Russia has denied it is mounting any attack on Ukraine and instead accused Ukraine, the U.S. and NATO of menacing forces near its borders. Russian President Vladimir Putin said Wednesday his government is seeking guarantees from the West that it not move troops or weapons systems ""in close vicinity to the Russian territory,"" while Lavrov called the presence of Ukrainian troops ""alarming."" Blinken literally laughed off that latter comment, telling reporters after a two-day NATO summit in Latvia that it was ""perplexing,"" ""profoundly wrong"" and ""misguided."" ""The idea that Ukraine represents a threat to Russia would be a bad joke if things weren't so serious,"" he added, warning that Russia may ""claim provocation for something that they were planning to do all along."" To that end, Blinken said, Russia has not only massed combat forces, it's also ""intensified disinformation to paint Ukraine as the aggressor"" -- increasing anti-Ukrainian propaganda by more than tenfold to levels not seen since its 2014 invasion. Russia's ""plans include efforts to destabilize Ukraine from within, as well as large-scale military operations,"" he added -- the former, a possible reference to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy's claim that Russia is behind a potential coup attempt to overthrow his government.

2021-11-26,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/International/russias-buildup-troops-ukraine-sparks-fears-attack-analysis/story?id=81370345,Russia's buildup of troops near Ukraine sparks fears of attack: Analysis,"Is Russia preparing to invade Ukraine? Fears of invasion are greater now than at any time since Moscow first seized Crimea in 2014. For the past month, the United States has been sounding the alarm that Russia has amassed more than 100,000 troops near eastern Ukraine and may be preparing to launch a major military incursion. Satellite imagery and videos posted to social media appear to show Russian armored units and artillery moving to the area. Ukraine’s military has also warned Russian forces could attack in late January or early February. The short answer of course is no one knows if Russian President Vladimir Putin is really planning an attack. Russian experts are fiercely divided over the Kremlin’s intentions: Is the country bluffing or flexing its muscles to intimidate Ukraine and the U.S. into concessions? Or is it preparing a real invasion? There have been war scares throughout seven-year conflict and this too could prove illusory. But the fears this time are different. Many analysts, including many who are normally skeptical of such scares, believe Putin’s calculus on Ukraine has shifted and the risk he will now use force is high. Those analysts believe the buildup is not just saber-rattling; it gives Russia an option to launch a real military intervention if Putin fails to get what he wants through threats. “Although Russian President Vladimir Putin may once again be engaging in coercive diplomacy, this time around Moscow may not be bluffing. If no agreement is reached, the conflict may renew on a much larger scale,” Michael Kofman and Michael Kimmage wrote in Foreign Affairs this week. “The scenario of a wider war is entirely plausible.” An invasion this time would be more dangerous than Russia’s seizure of Crimea, likely triggering the worst crisis between Moscow and the West in 40 years and carrying a risk of a wider conflict in Europe. The world went through this already at the start of the year when Russia began the troop buildup. It turned out Putin was bluffing. Many experts believe it helped win him a summit with President Joe Biden. Russia, however, has denied it is preparing to attack but has accused Ukraine of acting provocatively. Most analysts caution the current buildup may again be linked to another potential summit between Putin and Biden, one the Kremlin is pressing to hold by the end of this year. The Kremlin is good at creating the illusion of a potential attack and experts warn against falling into the trap of believing it. But the fears this time are different. The U.S. and independent analysts are expressing greater anxiety now than last April. Russia’s rhetoric is more aggressive this time around, according to analysts. Most experts believe Putin has not yet decided whether to use force. But at the root of the worries is that the Kremlin’s view of the conflict has crucially changed. Why would Russia invade now? This is the key question. The biggest argument is what would Putin gain. It would make a Russia a pariah, carrying major risks while likely achieving few of its objectives. The reasons for Russia’s current buildup are the same for seizing Crimea—the Kremlin will not accept ""losing"" Ukraine and having it join NATO and the European Union. The problem for the Kremlin is that Ukraine has been moving ever more firmly toward the West in recent years. Full membership in NATO is not on the cards but Ukraine has become closer with the alliance. The U.S. already supplies Ukraine with lethal weapons and Ukrainian troops train with NATO forces. As Andrew Weiss and Eugene Rumer from the Carnegie Center recently wrote, “The Kremlin increasingly views Ukraine as a Western aircraft carrier parked just across” from southern Russia. At the same time, Russia has come to see its diplomatic tools for keeping Ukraine close as non-functioning. In 2015, as Russian forces were inflicting heavily casualties, Moscow was able to force Ukraine to sign the so-called Minsk peace agreements. The deal obliged Kyiv to grant wide autonomy to the pro-Russian breakaway regions in its East. In practice, that would give Russia a lever inside Ukraine’s government, giving an effective veto over its efforts to join NATO or the EU. Ukraine has never wanted to accept that and the agreements have been effectively dead for years. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, meanwhile has turned to a hard-line approach to Russia. The fear is that amid all this, Putin now feels Ukraine is drifting too far, too fast from Russia and that force is the only way to get Western countries and Kyiv to take Moscow’s demands seriously. “Russian leaders have signaled that they have grown tired of diplomacy and find Ukraine’s growing integration with the United States and NATO intolerable,” wrote Kofman, an expert on Russian military policy, and Kimmage, a former State Department official on Russia/Ukraine policy. “The stage is set for Moscow to reset this equation through force—unless Moscow, Washington, and Kyiv are able to find a peaceful resolution.” The Kremlin has signaled what it wants. Last week, Putin said Russia should seek “serious, long-term” security guarantees from the U.S. over Ukraine. In practice, that likely means a guarantee of no further NATO expansion and the curtailing of Western military assistance to Kyiv. The fear among some analysts is whether Putin will use force if he doesn’t get those guarantees. Experts in Moscow with close ties to the Russian foreign policy establishment have echoed those worries. Fyodor Lukyanov, chairman of the Council of Foreign and Defense Policy, warned in an article this week that what's happening can become a “serious milestone in European history after the end of the Cold War.” “The unfolding situation is dangerous because of the loss of a common understanding of what is happening,” he wrote. A dangerous ingredient in all of this is Putin’s vision of Ukraine. Putin has repeatedly said he considers Ukrainians and Russians “one people” and the issue appears to have personal importance to him. In July, Putin published a 5,000-word article on Ukraine’s history where he questioned its right to exist as an independent state. As the historian Sergey Plokhy has written, Ukraine’s departure from its sphere of influence will mean the end of the Kremlin’s vision of Russia as an imperial power that Putin has sought to restore. Ukraine is “unfinished business” for Putin, Rumer and Weiss wrote. What might happen? The scenario most experts fear is Russia will use a false pretext of a supposed Ukrainian attack on the pro-Russian rebel territories to launch an invasion. Few believe Russia would try to seize Kyiv or occupy the whole country. What is seen as plausible is that Russia would try to inflict a devastating blow on Ukraine’s military and perhaps seize some territory, including major cities. The idea would be a blow so painful that it would force Kyiv and NATO to scale back their cooperation. This is what Russia did in 2008, when it invaded Georgia. Top Russian officials this week have been comparing the current situation to the run-up to the Georgia war, accusing Ukraine of preparing an attack. Some experts fear those comments are meant to lay the ground for a repeat of the Georgia invasion. Will it happen? Many experts argue it is still unlikely Putin will attack. Even those warning of the possibility say Putin may realize the costs outweigh the potential benefits. But these experts are concerned how plausible an attack has become. What is frightening is the gulf that is opening up between what the West views as Russia’s rational interests around Ukraine and what Russia thinks they are. “From the point of view of the balance of benefits and losses, neither side is interested in a real war,” Ivan Timofeyev, an analyst close to Russia’s foreign ministry, wrote in an article this week. He added, ""Therefore, it is hardly worth considering the war scenario as a likely one. However, history knows many examples when rational calculations have failed to put an end to escalation. There is only the hope that this isn’t the case here.""",4,,,,8
2021-11-21,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/top-national-security-officials-stress-collaboration-cyberspace/story?id=81258680,Top national security officials stress need for collaboration in cyberspace,"The United States' adversaries are trying to steal the nation's top secrets, top Cyber Command and National Security Agency officials say, and protecting the American people from these threats takes both the private and public sectors. ""Cybercom's mission is to play the away game and to execute operations outside of the United States that keep us secure,"" Maj. Gen. Joe Hartman, commander of the Cyber National Mission Force, told ABC News' Chief Justice Correspondent Pierre Thomas. ""On a daily basis, whether it's nation-state, malicious cyber actors trying to steal secrets, whether it's ransomware actors -- every day our adversary gets up and attempts to execute operations against the United States. They're not going to stop and neither are we."" Hartman oversees Cyber Command’s Cyber National Mission Force, comprised of more than 2,000 military and civilian personnel -- focused on securing and protection U.S. national interests from foreign-threat actors. The NSA has an entire center dedicated to collaborating with partners. ""So NSA has been in cybersecurity for a really long time,"" said Morgan Adamski, the chief of the NSA's Cybersecurity Collaboration Center. ""And we've shared our deep insights into foreign cyber-actor activity as well as our technical expertise, but the way that the actors are working now, they're working so quickly. We had to kind of adapt to the way that we were sharing that information."" She said the NSA engages with partners at a ""rapid"" speed to share information. Acting in the cyber world ""is part of our daily life,"" Hartman said. ""What we see with adversaries is they will execute broad-scale operations,"" he added, referencing Russia's role in last year's SolarWinds hack. The intrusion, believed to be carried out by Russia, involved software from SolarWinds, which makes IT management tools, that had been adulterated or ""trojanized"" with a vulnerability that could be exploited by hackers to steal information, manipulate systems or plant trap doors and other exploits for future use. It gained access to nine government agencies. ""They executed operations against thousands of targets, ultimately to provide them access and to use that access for future operations,"" he said in reference to the attack. Cyberspace is ""extraordinarily dynamic,"" Hartman said. ""Cyberspace is the one domain that changes on a daily basis,"" he said. ""And our adversaries pay attention to that. We need to pay attention to it. And as I think you're aware, when a vulnerability is identified, the quicker we are able to mitigate that vulnerability, the safer you are at home on your personal computer and the safer we are as a nation. But again, it is dynamic and it changes daily."" Rob Joyce, who serves as the Director of Cybersecurity at NSA, told ABC News that the NSA was not always a collaborative environment. ""NSA throughout history works in the secret area. We work with secrets. That doesn't make us open and collaborative. But what we've found is, the things we know are not useful unless we do something with it. Collaboration is the act of taking the secrets we know and getting those out to operationalize them."" He said the NSA has some of the best cyber experts in the world and employs some of the best cyber people In the country. ""It's all about the mission. It's about the outcomes, and that drives us to work together,"" he said. Joyce said even he could be susceptible to a phishing email and that systems need to be brought up to speed. ""We've got to have the systems that are resilient, and we've got to react fast and understand when we've been penetrated, so then we can take action to get that threat out of the system,"" he said.

2021-11-19,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/whats-stake-security-nation-nsa-chief-defending-us/story?id=81258606,"'What's at stake is obviously the security of our nation,' NSA chief says of defending US from cyberattacks","Every day, foreign adversaries make millions of attempts to scan America's military networks, Director of the National Security Agency and Commander of U.S. Cyber Command Gen. Paul Nakasone says, and there is incredible pressure to defend the nation from those adversaries. ""What's at stake is obviously the security of our nation,"" Nakasone told ABC News Chief Justice Correspondent Pierre Thomas in an exclusive interview. ""We don't want to have a failure to imagine what's happening."" ABC News was granted exclusive behind-the-scenes access to the ""Battle Bridge"" where the secret spy agency's cyber operations take place. Everyone from sailors to civilians works on the main floor of the Integrated Cyber Command Center at Fort Meade in Maryland outside Washington. ""This is military, civilian, contractor. This is Department of Defense. This is intelligence community. This is other agencies of our government. They're all resident here working side by side,"" Nakasone said, adding that they have ""unlimited reach."" The surge of ransomware is a national security issue, Nakasone said, adding that if you asked him a year ago what he thought about the response, he'd say it was a criminal matter. ""Think of your day, think of my day,"" he said. ""What do we do with regards to our information? How do we communicate? How do we buy things? How do we store our money? This is all done online. This is what our nation has been able to leverage for so many years. This is an important medium. And we have to make sure that that medium is safe and secure."" To do so, the U.S. Cyber Command uses ""Hunt Forward"" teams. ""Our 'Hunt Forward' teams are defensive teams that are requested by a partner, an ally, a country to come and hunt on their networks. Why do we do that? Because we do that to be able to identify malware and tradecraft of our adversaries,"" he said. ""Once we do that, we share that with the private sector and that provides a level of inoculation or protection from that type of malware. So, we've done 24 missions over the past several years."" Nakasone said he first heard about the Colonial Pipeline ransomware attack in the news media. In May, hackers, who the government later said were based in Russia, caused Colonial Pipeline's fuel lines to shut down and created a major disruption in the nation's fuel supply and a run on gas stations along the East Coast. ""I heard about it from family members that said, 'Hey, aren't you the commander of U.S. Cyber Command and the director of NSA? Can't you do something about this?' That's the moment in time when I knew that this is serious, this is touching the American people,"" he said. In addition to Colonial Pipeline, meat supplier JBS was hacked by a different Russia-based group, REvil, authorities said, prompting the Justice Department to put out a $10 million reward for information leading to its founder. That reward shows the ""national power"" being applied against ransomware attacks, Nakasone said. Stopping and protecting against cyberattacks takes private and public partnerships, he said, and 90% of the nation's critical infrastructure is in the private sector. Nakasone said six months ago he would have given American businesses a ""low C"" for investing in infrastructure to protect their networks and educating the workforce. ""I think that we've gotten a lot better since then, but we still have a ways to go,"" he said. Nakasone also assured Americans that the agency is not spying on Americans, as some have alleged. ""What I would say that makes me so confident is every single person that works at our agency whether they're military, civilian, the first thing you do, you swear an oath to defend the Constitution,"" he said. ""The second thing is we have robust training here. And the third thing is we have a culture of being able to look and ensure what we're doing is by the book and by the law."" Asked about intelligence failures in Afghanistan, Nakasone said things always look different in hindsight. ""I think with any mission we always take a look back and say, 'What could we have done better?' We've had 20 years of experience in being able to deploy our people to Afghanistan, think about it,"" he said. ""What really was the difference is not the fact that we sent great technology or the fact that we had superb tradecraft, it was our talent that went to Afghanistan. But we'll take a look back and we'll say what could we have done better certainly."" He said the NSA takes security seriously, especially after well-known security breaches like the case of Edward Snowden. ""We take security incredibly seriously here. There's a vigilance that's applied to it. Understanding exactly what takes place here is something that we have learned our lessons on, and we'll continue to make sure that we have a safe and secure workplace to make sure that we can operate from."" Nakasone said a top priority is recruiting and maintaining the best talent, adding he prides himself on the diversity of U.S. Cyber Command and NSA's workforce. ""One of the things that makes this place go, that makes our agency and command go, the best people. And so how do we recruit? How do we retain? How do we ensure the population can rejoin our agency once they go to the private sector? That's what keeps me up at night,"" he said. ABC News' Jack Date contributed to this report.",20,,,,1
2021-11-18,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/US/iranian-nationals-charged-campaign-undermine-2020-us-election/story?id=81257507,Iranian nationals charged in campaign to undermine 2020 US election,"Two Iranian nationals have been charged in a disinformation campaign meant to influence the outcome of the 2020 presidential election, including by threatening physical violence if registered Democrats failed to switch their affiliation and vote for then-President Donald Trump. Seyyed Kazemi and Sajjad Kashian obtained confidential information about American voters from at least one state election website, sent those people threatening emails and gained access to a news network's computer system that would have allowed them to disseminate false claims about the election, according to the indictment. ABC News reported in October 2020 Iran and Russia had obtained voter information. ""As alleged, Kazemi and Kashian were part of a coordinated conspiracy in which Iranian hackers sought to undermine faith and confidence in the U.S. Presidential elections,"" said U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, Damian Williams. The indictment did not name the state infiltrated, but Florida law enforcement and the FBI previously had said they were investigating the threatening emails sent to registered voters. The Iranians, both of whom are believed to be in Iran and out of reach of U.S. law enforcement, claimed to be a group of Proud Boys volunteers, according to the indictment. They allegedly sent Facebook messages and emails to Republican officials that claimed Democrats were going to exploit vulnerabilities in voter registration websites. They also allegedly sent registered Democrats messages that threatened physical injury if they did not change their affiliation and vote for President Trump, the indictment said. ""We are in possession of all your information (email, address, telephone ... everything). You are currently registered as a Democrat and we know this because we have gained access into the entire voting infrastructure. You will vote for Trump on Election Day or we will come after you. Change your party affiliation to Republican to let us know you received our message and will comply. We will know which candidate you voted for,"" the indictment quoted the emails as saying. There was no evidence the campaign successfully convinced any voter to actually change their registration, according to a Justice Department official. ""State-sponsored actors, including Iranian groups, have engaged in covert and deceptive activities to disseminate disinformation through websites and social media designed to undermine Americans’ faith in U.S. elections,"" U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a statement Thursday. The U.S. government took decisive and disruptive action against those seeking to interfere with the sanctity of our elections, including the FBI warning the public of the attempts ahead of the 2020 elections."" The day after the election, the Iranians tried to use stolen credentials to hack their way into an unnamed American media company's computer networks, the indictment said. The company alerted the FBI, which stopped them from altering any content or disseminating false claims, according to a Justice Department official. Prosecutors described Kazemi and Kashian as experienced computer hackers who worked as contractors for an Iran-based company formerly known as Eeleyanet Gostar, which the U.S. believes is linked to the Iranian government. In conjunction with the Dept. of Justice, the U.S. Treasury has also sanctioned the Iranian company and six of its employees, who it said were involved in this disinformation campaign to influence the 2020 U.S. elections. The firm, now known as Emennet Pasargad, was previously sanctioned under its former name by the Trump administration for supporting Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and its electronic warfare wing. Kazemi and Kashian were employees at Emennet and actually ""executed cyber-enabled operations,"" according to the Treasury. Four other Iranians serve on Emennet's board of directors and are being sanctioned for their role at the firm. ""This indictment details how two Iran-based actors waged a targeted, coordinated campaign to erode confidence in the integrity of the U.S. electoral system and to sow discord among Americans,"" Assistant Attorney General Matt Olsen said.",20,,,,22
2021-11-11,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/russia-move-ukraine-foreign-minister-warns/story?id=81108264,"Russia may be 'looking to move further' into Ukraine, its foreign minister warns","As it again masses troops and equipment on the border with Ukraine, the Russian government is ""looking for the opportunity to move further"" into Ukrainian territory, the country's foreign minister warned in an exclusive interview. ""We do not want to scare anyone, but we have to remain vigilant,"" Foreign Affairs Minister Dmytro Kuleba told ABC News. ""We are extremely worried, but listen -- when you live next to Russia for seven years in an armed conflict, you kind of learn to be worried. You get used to it."" Kuleba just wrapped up a high-profile visit to Washington, meeting Wednesday with President Joe Biden's top foreign policy aides, Secretary of State Antony Blinken and National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan. The visit was just the latest exchange between Biden's administration and that of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, who was infamously urged by former President Donald Trump to announce an investigation into Biden and his son Hunter. Kuleba noted the ""turbulence"" in U.S.-Ukrainian relations during the Trump years, but eagerly looked to turn the page -- saying ties were ""revived, restored, relaunched, whatever word we use."" U.S. officials have tried to demonstrate that, too, expressing growing concern about Russia's military movements in recent weeks. Blinken said the U.S. commitment to Ukraine remains ""ironclad"" and warned Moscow that ""any escalatory or aggressive actions would be of great concern by the United States."" As many as 100,000 Russian troops have been moved to its western border with Ukraine, Zelenskiy said Thursday. Satellite images published by the firm Maxar Technologies last week showed large ground forces deployed 140 miles from the border with heavy equipment, while the defense firm Janes said the buildup was largely covert, with elite ground units and often taking place at night, according to Bloomberg News. Russian government officials denied the movements, then dismissed concerns about them and accused the U.S. and NATO of aggression. Ukrainian officials have swung between raising alarm at Russia's recent actions and downplaying them as a tactic by Russian leader Vladimir Putin meant to create hysteria. ""Russia's psychological pressure has not worked on us for a long time. Your panic will definitely not help, but it can help the enemy. It can become part of the information war and bring no less harm to the country than the fighting,"" Zelenskiy said Thursday. Standing alongside Kuleba on Wednesday, Blinken said, ""We don't have clarity into Moscow's intentions, but we do know its playbook,"" recalling Putin's 2014 invasion of Ukraine's territory, Crimea, which it still occupies, and incursion into eastern Ukraine. That still-smoldering war between Russian-backed separatists and the Ukrainian government has claimed 14,000 lives and counting. That playbook can be swiftly executed, Kuleba warned, because a similar military buildup in April ended with troops departing, but the infrastructure and equipment largely remaining in place. ""With this infrastructure in place along our border, it will not take Russia a lot of time to resort to an offensive action if it decides to do so, and our goal and our objective is to make everything, everything possible to prevent Russia from making that decision,"" he told ABC News. Part of that effort is boosting U.S. military assistance to Ukraine, which both Kuleba and Blinken called for after their meetings Wednesday. Blinken declined to offer specifics, but Kuleba called for greater intelligence sharing, air defense systems and more. The Biden administration has been ""very specific and very committed"" in responding to Russian aggression, he told ABC News, taking a ""proactive stance"" and walking the walk. ""What is even more important from my conversations here in Washington, I see that the United States are ready not only to talk, but also to act, to act in order to deter Russia and to strengthen Ukraine's capacity to defend itself,"" he said. ""This is even more important."" Selling Ukrainian lethal weapons was at the heart of Trump's first impeachment and the infamous call between him and Zelenskiy. As the newly elected Ukrainian leader asked Trump for more Javelin anti-tank missiles, Trump turned the conversation to ask for a ""favor"" and announce a probe of Biden, his son Hunter and Hunter's time on the board of the Ukrainian state-owned energy company Burisma. While there was no announcement about new weapons sales, Kuleba said he was ""leaving Washington, D.C., in a good mood because this is exactly what we were working for."" ""The truth is, there has been some turbulence in our bilateral relations under the previous administration. There was some hesitations of how this relationship will proceed further in the early days of this administration. But I think that it will not be an exaggeration to say that the quality and the number of contacts between our presidents, between me and foreign secretary, and at all other levels of our teams has been unprecedented,"" he told ABC News. But that's not to say there aren't critical differences now, even on the potential threat from Russia. During their joint press conference Wednesday, Blinken refused to say Russia is using energy as a weapon, while Kuleba clearly said it already is, including by halting coal shipments to Ukraine and withholding greater natural gas imports through Ukraine to Europe amid an energy crisis across the continent. ""What is unfolding in Europe now is a very complicated game with many elements in it,"" Kuleba said at the State Department, accusing Russia and its ally Belarus of pressuring Europe using energy, propaganda and disinformation, cyber attacks, military buildups, and the migration crisis between Belarus and its neighbors. Biden has called for stabilizing U.S. relations with Russia, including by holding his summit with Putin in June -- a meeting that could have a sequel soon. Kuleba said he understands the sentiment and sees no ""risks"" that U.S.-Russian dialogue would be ""done at the expense of Ukraine,"" but he warned that Putin only responds to strength. ""Our experience of recent seven years demonstrates that Moscow understands and respects the language of strength. You do not have to threaten them, you do not have to act, to use force against them, but they respect you if you are strong with them, if you are tough with them,"" he said. One issue, however, where critics say the U.S. is not standing strong is Nord Stream 2, the nearly completed natural gas pipeline connecting Russia and Germany and circumventing Ukraine, Poland and other U.S. partners. Biden waived congressionally-mandated sanctions on the German company constructing the pipeline and its CEO, saying he did not want to damage ties with a key ally. Instead, the U.S. and Germany issued a joint statement, committing to helping Ukraine diversify its energy resources and responding swiftly if Russia withholds gas to Ukraine. But joined by Poland, Kyiv expressed anger and dismay at the non-binding agreement. Kuleba papered over that disagreement, saying what was most important is that they were talking -- but urged action if needed. ""We have differences in seeing how the negative consequences of this project being implemented can be avoided or prevented,"" Kuleba told ABC News. ""We definitely want the United States to remain vigilant and ready, ready to take action if the current policy fails."" ABC News's Yulia Drozd contributed to this report from Kyiv.",4,,,,9
2021-11-05,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/blinken-details-efforts-investigate-havana-syndrome/story?id=80991396,Blinken details new efforts to investigate 'Havana syndrome',"Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Friday detailed new efforts to investigate ""Havana syndrome,"" the mysterious health affliction affecting dozens of U.S. personnel first identified in Cuba and now including several countries. In his most extensive remarks yet on the issue, Blinken said the incidents have inflicted ""profound"" physical and physiological harm on those impacted. ""All of us in the U.S. government, and especially with the State Department, are intently focused on getting to the bottom of what and who is causing these incidents, caring for those who have been affected and protecting our people,"" Blinken said. Symptoms include headaches, dizziness, cognitive difficulties, tinnitus, vertigo and trouble with seeing, hearing or balancing. Many officials have suffered symptoms years after reporting an incident, while some have been diagnosed with traumatic brain injuries. Blinken has tapped two career diplomats to oversee the agency's response to ""Havana syndrome."" For almost five years now, the issue -- which the Biden administration has labeled ""anomalous health incidents"" -- has vexed U.S. officials, who don't know who or what is behind it. In an effort to learn more, Blinken confirmed Friday that the State Department has deployed new technology to U.S. missions around the world to help understand the cause. ""The details I can provide on this are limited as well, but I can say that new technology is helping us more quickly and thoroughly evaluate a variety of potential causes of these incidents, and we've distributed across posts so that we can respond rapidly to new reports,"" he said. He encouraged employees with any knowledge of an incident to come forward. ""There is absolutely no stigma in reporting these incidents. And there will of course be no negative consequences of any kind,"" Blinken said. ""On the contrary, reporting means that we can get people the help they need. And by reporting, you can help keep others safe, and help us get to the bottom of who and what is responsible."" American diplomats, spies, and other officials have reported symptoms in nearly a dozen counties, starting in Cuba and expanding to China, Russia, Uzbekistan, and more. Most recently, cases were reported among staff and families at the U.S. embassy in Colombia, weeks before Blinken arrived for a visit. But it's unclear how many reported incidents are confirmed to be episodes of what many victims insist are attacks. Both the Trump and Biden administrations have been accused by victims and other officials of not doing enough to provide medical care to affected personnel or not sharing enough information about reported incidents as they happen. Blinken acknowledged the administration could do better and committed to more transparency. He met a group of affected personnel in Bogotá last month, telling them ""their case is an absolute priority for him,"" a senior State Department official told ABC News. President Joe Biden signed the HAVANA Act last month, which authorizes the CIA director and the secretary of state to provide affected employees with financial support for brain injuries under detailed criteria. It also requires both agencies to report to Congress on how those payments are being made and whether additional action is needed to aid victims.",20,,,,0
2021-10-25,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/russian-nation-state-actor-solarwinds-cyberattack-microsoft/story?id=80771329,Russian nation-state actor behind SolarWinds cyberattack at it again: Microsoft,"The same actors behind the SolarWinds breach that infiltrated nine U.S. government agencies is attempting to do the same targeting the global supply chain, researchers from Microsoft have concluded. Russian nation-state actor Nobelium is targeting the cloud service and technology providers ""that customize, deploy and manage"" services for customers, Microsoft said. ""We believe Nobelium ultimately hopes to piggyback on any direct access that resellers may have to their customers' IT systems and more easily impersonate an organization’s trusted technology partner to gain access to their downstream customers,"" the report said. The intrusion involves software from SolarWinds, which makes IT management tools, that had been adulterated or ""Trojanized"" with a vulnerability that could be exploited by hackers to steal information, manipulate systems or plant trap doors and other exploits for future use. The hack even compromised former acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf's emails, according to three sources familiar with the situation. Starting in May 2021, the company said it notified 140 resellers and technology service providers it said had been targeted by Nobelium, 14 of which were compromised. Microsoft said these attacks are part of a larger pattern of the group’s activities: between July 1 and October 19, they informed 609 customers that they had been targeted by Nobelium. ""This recent activity is another indicator that Russia is trying to gain long-term, systematic access to a variety of points in the technology supply chain and establish a mechanism for surveilling – now or in the future – targets of interest to the Russian government,"" Microsoft said. The alleged activity also comes as President Joe Biden has put Russia on notice that these types of cyberattacks will not be tolerated. The White House on Monday declined to explicitly confirm the allegation by Microsoft that the same actors behind the SolarWinds breach were now attacking the global supply chain. But when asked about it by ABC News, White House principal deputy press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre did not dispute the Microsoft account. She even repeated some of what the company alleged, but referred questions about the details to the company -- and more broadly said the U.S. was ""aggressively using our authorities to protect the nation from cyberthreats."" ""Broadly speaking,"" she said, ""the federal government is aggressively using our authorities to protect the nation from cyberthreats, including helping the private sector defend itself through increased intelligence sharing, innovative partnership to deploy cybersecurity technologies, bilateral and multilateral diplomacy and measures we do not speak about publicly or national security reasons."" Javed Ali, the former director of counterterrorism at the National Security Council, told ABC News this campaign is a continuation of Russia's aggressive cyber operations ""using state-backed security services."" ""This operation also raises a host of questions about the limits of the Biden administration's approach to Russia, which seems to include a combination of carrots and sticks to prevent, punish, and deter similar attacks,"" Ali said. The Biden administration has taken several steps to in an attempt to mitigate cyberattacks, such as executive orders strengthening cooperation on cybersecurity with the public sector and sanctions against the Russian government officials or the criminal groups responsible for cyberattacks. ""Critics of this approach will say the Russian government continues to operate with impunity in cyberspace and that the United States has not imposed the right level of costs to deter future activity,"" Ali, who also was a senior FBI and DHS official said. ""Whether the Biden administration is willing to escalate to even more aggressive measures remains to be seen given other geopolitical risks and concerns with Russian activity."" Jean-Pierre, the White House spokesperson, seemed to downplay the alleged Russian flouting of Biden's actions. ""According to Microsoft, the activities described were unsophisticated password spray and phishing attempts for the purpose of surveillance that cybersecurity exa-- -- experts say are attempted every day by Russia and other foreign governments and have been for years,"" she said. ""You can prevent these attempts if the cloud service providers implement baseline cybersecurity practices, including multi-factor authentication."" ABC News reached out to the Russian embassy for comment but did not receive an immediate response. ABC News' Ben Gittleson contributed to this report.",20,,,,5

""On October 16, 2021, the Company identified and began to investigate and take steps to contain a potential security incident. On October 17, 2021, the Company identified that certain servers and workstations in its environment were encrypted with ransomware, and that certain office and operational networks were disrupted,"" the filing says. ""Data also was taken from the Company's network. The Company is working to determine what information the data contained and will take other actions as appropriate based on its review."" The company warned that while the incident is actively being managed, ""the event has caused – and may continue to cause – disruption to parts of the Company's business, including certain aspects of its provision of local advertisements by its local broadcast stations on behalf of its customers. The Company is working diligently to restore operations quickly and securely."" Sinclair Broadcast Group says it can't determine whether the event will have a material impact on business operations and that the investigation is ongoing. It is not known who is behind the cyberattack or whether Sinclair Broadcast Group paid the ransom. The company responded to ABC News with a statement similar to what was in the SEC filing, and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency referred ABC News to Sinclair. Two major ransomware incidents targeting critical infrastructure sectors in the United States have occurred already this year. Meat supplier JBS, which was the victim of a ransomware attack over Memorial Day weekend, paid $11 million in bitcoins to the hackers that penetrated their system, the company announced. The FBI attributed the cyberattack to REvil and Sodinokibi, two criminal organizations thought to be based in Russia. Colonial Pipeline, which transports approximately 45% of all fuel consumed on the East Coast, paid millions of dollars to the cybercriminal group DarkSide following a ransomware attack in May that led the pipeline to briefly shut down its operations, according to court documents. The Justice Department announced it successfully seized some of the cryptocurrency that Colonial paid to the hackers. The Darkside criminal organization operates in Eastern Europe and Russian intelligence has been known to cooperate with Eastern European cybercriminals in the past. Both the Director of the FBI Christopher Wray and Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas touched on the cyber threat, including dark web efforts to hack and sell people's personal information, before a congressional panel in September. Mayorkas noted that ransomware incidents were up in 2020. ""Last year, victims paid an estimated $350 million in ransoms, a 311% increase over the prior year, with the average payment exceeding $300,000,"" he said. Wray said the FBI was investigating over 100 incidents of ransomware. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency Director Jenn Easterly called the ransomware problem an ""epidemic"" that will require international help and cooperation. ""If a highly dedicated, sophisticated state actor wants to own you they will, but there are things that people can do to keep themselves safe,"" she explained. The CISA director said over 90% of successful cyberattacks occur because of a phishing email and urged companies to prepare for disruption. Mayorkas said it is difficult to locate and apprehend cybercriminals, but that DHS is ""bringing additional and increasing resources to that effort.""",20,,,,19
2021-10-08,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/biden-signs-law-expand-health-care-havana-syndrome/story?id=80478442,Biden signs law to expand health care for 'Havana syndrome' victims,"President Joe Biden signed into law a bill that provides financial assistance and better health care to victims of ""Havana syndrome,"" the mysterious health incidents affecting dozens of U.S. personnel first identified in Cuba and now including several countries. After a closed-door signing ceremony, Biden said in a statement that his administration is marshalling the U.S. government's ""full resources"" to care for victims and ""to get to the bottom of these incidents, including to determine the cause and who is responsible"" -- a mystery that has confounded U.S. officials for nearly five years now. The HAVANA Act authorizes the CIA director and the secretary of state to provide affected employees with financial support for brain injuries under detailed criteria. It also requires both agencies to report to Congress on how those payments are being made and whether additional action is needed to aid victims. Several affected personnel have complained privately, and in some cases publicly, that they have not been able to access proper medical care -- in some cases questioning whether the U.S. government believes they are injured. ""For far too long, U.S. public servants and their loved ones who've suffered from directed energy attacks have been denied the care they need and deserve. That's unacceptable,"" said Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., one of the law's co-authors who has advocated for victims for years. Its enactment will help ""by removing barriers to critical medical attention and paving the way for personnel with brain injuries to recover,"" she added. American diplomats, spies and other officials have reported strange experiences and debilitating symptoms in several countries now. Symptoms include headaches, dizziness, cognitive difficulties, tinnitus, vertigo and trouble with seeing, hearing, or balancing. Many officials have suffered symptoms years after reporting an incident while some have been diagnosed with traumatic brain injuries. In some cases, especially those first reported in Cuba in late 2016 and throughout 2017, U.S. officials described intense feelings of pressure or vibration and, at times, a screeching or chirping sound. It's unclear how many U.S. officials have confirmed medical symptoms, but new cases have been allegedly reported in several more countries in recent weeks, including India, Serbia and Germany. One reported incident in Vietnam delayed Vice President Kamala Harris's trip there in August. Beyond more than 40 affected staffers in Cuba, the U.S. government has officially acknowledged reported incidents in China, Russia, Uzbekistan, Austria and the United States, although the White House said the vast majority have been reported overseas. ""Addressing these incidents has been a top priority for my Administration. We are bringing to bear the full resources of the U.S. Government to make available first-class medical care to those affected and to get to the bottom of these incidents, including to determine the cause and who is responsible,"" Biden said in his statement Friday. His National Security Council is leading a government-wide probe, while both the CIA and the State Department have their own internal task forces to coordinate their responses, too. Many victims of ""Havana syndrome,"" which the U.S. government now refers to as ""anomalous health incidents,"" have struggled for years to get the health care they seek. Many others, including State Department officials who haven't been affected, have been frustrated by the Trump and Biden administrations' lack of information about reported cases -- instead often learning about reported incidents in the press. In his first note to all staff about the issue in August, Secretary of State Antony Blinken acknowledged the administration ""can and will do a better job keeping you informed of our efforts to get answers, support those affected, and protect our people,"" according to the note, obtained first by ABC News. But the lack of information stems in part from how little the U.S. government knows about what was once referred to as ""health attacks,"" including what is causing them. Last December, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine issued a report that concluded that ""directed, pulsed radio frequency energy appears to be the most plausible mechanism in explaining these cases, especially in individuals with the distinct early symptoms."" CIA Director Bill Burns, who has met with his agency's affected personnel and escalated efforts to solve this mystery, has boosted that finding as well -- telling NPR in July there's ""certainly a very strong possibility"" that some actor is behind the incidents. But last week, the State Department declassified a secret 2018 report that cast doubt on that theory in some corners. Conducted by JASON, an independent scientific advisory group created during the Cold War to consult the U.S. government on defense science and technology, it concluded that radio or microwave energy could not produce the sound recorded by some U.S. diplomats in Cuba and their reported medical symptoms. Instead, it said, the sounds were ""mechanical or biological in origin, rather than electronic. The most likely source is the Indies short-tailed cricket, Anurogryllis celerinictus."" But a senior administration official told BuzzFeed News, which filed a Freedom of Information Act request for the JASON report and first reported on it, that its findings are ""not aligned with the Biden-Harris administration's understanding of AHI (anomalous health incidents) and it has not informed our response."" Either way, the report -- written before incidents were reported in several other countries -- determined that the sounds themselves were not injuring diplomats and could instead have been ""introduced by an adversary as deception so as to mask an entirely unrelated mode of causing illness in diplomatic personnel.""

2021-09-13,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/International/putin-watches-huge-display-firepower-zapad-war-games/story?id=79997473,Putin watches huge display of firepower during Zapad war games,"MULINO FIRING RANGE, Russia -- Russian President Vladimir Putin watched a huge display of firepower put on by his military Monday when he attended the finale of what is believed to be the largest Russian war games held in Europe since the Cold War. The joint exercises with Belarus -- called Zapad -- take place every four years and their main phase began last week, involving tens of thousands of troops and hundreds of tanks, aircrafts and warships at sites across western Russia and in Belarus. Zapad -- which means ""West"" in Russian -- is intended to test the country's ability to fight a major war with NATO on its western border. The exercise has its origins in the Cold War, but in recent years as relations have worsened with the West, Putin has increased their scale, using them to illustrate restored Russian power. Russia has claimed this year's exercises involve 200,000 troops, but most military analysts believe that is a significant exaggeration, and the real figure is likely something closer to 50,000 to 100,000. Putin on Monday attended what amounted to a heavily scripted, grand finale to the drills which took place at a firing range near Nizhny Novgorod, a city about 300 miles from Moscow. From a grandstand overlooking the Mulino range, Putin watched the event through a pair of binoculars, while heavily armed snipers kept guard. For 45 minutes, Russian troops unleashed a colossal barrage, involving howitzers, multiple rocket launchers and dozens of tanks and armored vehicles, while warplanes and helicopters flew in waves overhead. In the exercise, the Russian-led force was defending against a military belonging to a notional enemy, named ""the westerners."" Besides Russian and Belarusian troops, small contingents from India, Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, Mongolia and Armenia also participated. The display watched by Putin appeared notably larger than that put on in 2017, at the last Zapad exercises -- and those drills rattled nerves in eastern Europe, amid overheated speculation that they might be used to cover an imminent Russian invasion. This year's exercises attracted much less media attention, despite a more tense political atmosphere in Belarus following the mass protests against authoritarian leader Alexander Lukashenko. Lukashenko's crushing of the peaceful protests, with Russia's support, has placed him and Moscow in confrontation with European countries and the United States. Since Lukashenko sought rescue from the Kremlin, there have been concerns that Putin will use that leverage to demand he fulfill a long-time Russian goal of integrating Belarus with Russia. Last week, as the exercises began, Putin and Lukashenko announced plans for significantly deeper economic integration, under the slogan ""Two countries, one economy."" With Lukashenko now dependent on Russian support to remain in power, both sides are using the drills to emphasize Moscow's strong backing of the Belarusian leader. ""It is in Minsk's interest to invite a much larger Russian footprint as a show of support for the regime,"" Michael Kofman, director of the Russia Studies Program at the Center for Naval Analyses, wrote in an article for the website War on the Rocks last week. ""Judging from early deployments and training range selection, a more sizable Russian contingent will be in Belarus and Russian troops will be much closer to the borders with Poland than they were during previous Zapad exercises,"" said Kofman. The exercise's imagined scenario simulated Russia helping Belarus to defend against an attack by three fictional states, ""Nyaris,"" ""Pomoria"" and the ""Polar Republic"" -- thinly disguised versions of Lithuania, Poland and a Scandinavian country. Lukashenko has claimed the protests against him are part of a planned invasion of Belarus by NATO countries, repeatedly making wild claims last year that western forces were massed on the border. This year's Zapad drills appeared partly to incorporate that scenario, including scripts where western-backed ""terrorists"" provoked instability, as a pretext for invasion. Belarus' neighbors Poland and Lithuania have expressed unease about the exercises again this year. Both countries are already struggling with a migration crisis engineered by Lukashenko in relation to their support for pro-democracy opposition. In recent months, European officials have accused Lukashenko of flying in thousands of migrants, mostly from Iraq, and pushing them across the border. The exercises, though important for training, are also in many ways also a campaign tool for Putin. Stephen Ganyard, a former Deputy Assistant Secretary of State and ABC News contributor said the shows of force are ""mostly for domestic consumption."" The dramatic show on Monday came just four days before Russia's parliamentary elections. Military experts have cautioned against accepting Russia's claims about the size of the exercises, which they warn are partly intended to give an exaggerated impression of Russian military power. ""Russian military leaders likely hope Western media will report exaggerated figures, which help validate the scale and success of the exercise,"" Kofman wrote. NATO has also accused Russia of failing to formally declare the real number of troops involved. A 1990 agreement, the Vienna Document, obliges Russia to invite observers from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) for exercises involving more than 13,000 troops. But despite its public statements that 200,000 are taking part, Russia has circumvented the rule by claiming fewer than 13,000 troops are participating in each individual drill. Russia has insisted the exercises are entirely defensive and at firing ranges last week Russian commanders were careful to repeat the drills were not intended to be threatening. ""We didn't want to worry anyone,"" said Col. Alexander Zavasky, the commander of an airborne unit drilling in Kaliningrad, told ABC News on Saturday. ""It's a pre-planned exercise, and so, don't worry.""",4,,,,8
2021-08-24,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/case-havana-syndrome-vietnam-delays-vice-president-harriss/story?id=79618335,Possible case of 'Havana syndrome' in Vietnam delays Vice President Harris' visit,"Vice President Kamala Harris' visit to Vietnam on Tuesday was interrupted by a report of an ""anomalous health incident,"" the U.S. Embassy in Hanoi said in a statement -- the latest case of the mysterious onset of medical symptoms more commonly referred to as ""Havana syndrome."" This is the first public report of an incident in Vietnam and the first publicly reported case involving a senior U.S. leader's travel overseas. The source of the unexplained health incidents, which now number over 130 possible cases, remains unknown, vexing U.S. officials amid multiple investigations and task forces by the CIA, State Department and National Security Council, which is leading a government-wide probe. It's been nearly five years since State Department, CIA and other personnel at the U.S. Embassy in Havana first reported strange experiences, like feelings of pressure or vibration and a screeching sound and debilitating symptoms, including headaches, nausea, cognitive deficits and trouble with seeing, hearing or balancing. Several officials have been diagnosed with traumatic brain injuries. Since then, cases have been reported in several other countries, including China, Uzbekistan, Russia, Austria, Germany and the United States, although it's unclear how many U.S. officials have confirmed medical symptoms. ""While this is not a confirmed case at this point in time, we take any reported incident ... quite seriously,"" said White House press secretary Jen Psaki, adding that the incident was reported recently and affected one U.S. staffer at the embassy, not a member of the vice president's team. ""It was an individual who was in country and had been reported previously,"" Psaki added, saying a security assessment was conducted and decided that Harris could travel ahead. The vice president was set to arrive in Hanoi Tuesday during a tour of Southeast Asia, but her departure from Singapore was delayed by over three hours. She arrived several hours later, ignoring reporters' shouted questions on the tarmac. ""She is well. All is fine,"" Harris's spokesperson Symone Sanders told reporters before her departure from Singapore. It's unclear how many health incidents have been reported at the U.S. mission in Vietnam, but it was a single incident that caused concern among Harris' team and the embassy. ""The Vice President's office was made aware of a report of a recent possible anomalous health incident in Hanoi, Vietnam. After careful assessment, the decision was made to continue with the Vice President's trip,"" according to the U.S. Embassy's statement. The administration has declined to provide more information, including when the incident took place or whether the official was medically evacuated. A State Department spokesperson told ABC News that the agency is ""aware of reports of possible UHIs (unexplained health incidents) in Vietnam"" -- another term they use internally for ""Havana syndrome"" cases -- but declined to speak to individual cases, including whether anyone was evacuated. But the spokesperson said for Havana syndrome cases, a medevac is not necessarily specialized transportation out of the country, but ""a consultation in the United States, or another medical center of excellence, to ascertain the best appropriate care."" Last week, the State Department confirmed that it was aware of reported cases at the U.S. mission in Germany. Spokesperson Ned Price told reporters that they ""vigorously investigate"" all ""unexplained health incidents and provide ""immediate and appropriate attention and care"" to employees who report one. Many U.S. officials have grown frustrated with leadership, during both the Trump and Biden administrations, for a lack of information about reported cases or for not being proactive enough in providing treatment and care. In his first note to all staff about the issue, Secretary of State Antony Blinken acknowledged the administration ""can and will do a better job keeping you informed of our efforts to get answers, support those affected, and protect our people,"" according to the note, obtained first by ABC News. But the lack of information stems in part from how little the U.S. government knows about what was once referred to as ""health attacks,"" including what is causing them.

The CIA, State Department and Pentagon all have their own internal task forces to address cases among their personnel and search for possible clues into the causes. The State Department's is overseen by Pamela Spratlen, a two-time ambassador, while the CIA assigned a veteran officer critical to the agency's efforts to find Osama bin Laden to now head its cell. In addition, the State Department started a pilot program to begin recording baseline medical information of personnel and their adult family members before they move to U.S. diplomatic posts overseas. Similarly, the CIA has tripled the number of full-time medical personnel focused on the issue, according to its director Bill Burns. He told NPR last month that while the symptoms are ""real, and it's serious,"" the agency still has no definitive answers on the cause.

DHS' National Terrorism Advisory System bulletin issued on Friday, warned that threats from domestic terrorists -- individuals engaged in grievance-based violence -- and foreign terrorists are exacerbated by the pandemic, ""including grievances over public health safety measures and perceived government restrictions."" The bulletin said that racially or ethnically motivated extremists will exploit the reintroduction of COVID-19 variants as a means to carry out attacks because of reimplemented pandemic restrictions. This is the third NTAS bulletin the Department has issued since January. The DHS also warned that because of the upcoming 9/11 anniversary foreign terrorists or people inspired by foreign terrorists might seek to carry out an attack around the anniversary. Al-Qaeda released an issue of Inspire magazine for the first time in over four years, with the hopes of inspiring people to carry out attacks, according to the bulletin. The bulletin also warned that domestic violent extremists have targeted houses of worship. ""Historically, mass-casualty domestic violent extremist attacks linked to RMVEs have targeted houses of worship and crowded commercial facilities or gatherings,"" it read and that some RMVEs (racially motivated violent extremists) ""advocate via online platforms for a race war and have stated that civil disorder provides opportunities to engage in violence in furtherance of ideological objectives."" Reopening of schools and other institutions, as well as religious holidays over the next few months could become ""targets of opportunity for violence,"" the bulletin further warned. DHS also cautioned about foreign and domestic groups as well as foreign intelligence services (but did not specify which ones) that ""continue to introduce, amplify, and disseminate narratives online that promote violence, and have called for violence against elected officials, political representatives, government facilities, law enforcement, religious communities or commercial facilities, and perceived ideologically-opposed individuals."" ABC News previously reported on the Department's concern about the conspiracy theory that former President Donald Trump will be reinstated as U.S. president last Friday. ""Law enforcement have expressed concerns that the broader sharing of false narratives and conspiracy theories will gain traction in mainstream environments, resulting in individuals or small groups embracing violent tactics to achieve their desired objectives. With a diverse array of threats, DHS is concerned that increased outbreaks of violence in some locations, as well as targeted attacks against law enforcement, may strain local resources,"" the bulletin reads. Some domestic violent extremists ""continue to derive inspiration and obtain operational guidance through the consumption of information shared in certain online communities. This includes information regarding the use of improvised explosive devices and small arms."" The Department also warned of nation-state adversaries attempting to sow politcal discord, citing examples of Russia, China and Iran attempting to cast doubt on vaccine efficacy. ""DHS remains committed to sharing timely information with the public about the heightened threat environment in order to protect communities across our country,"" said Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro N. Mayorkas in a statement on Friday. ""Today's NTAS Bulletin advises the public about the heightened threat landscape we face and how DHS is working with our partners, at every level of government and in the community, to combat domestic terrorism and targeted violence in all its forms. We are committed to ensuring every initiative undertaken by DHS in response to the threat is consistent with privacy protections, civil rights and civil liberties, First Amendment-protected rights, and other applicable laws.""",20,,,,17

Blinken committed to meeting ""soon"" with staff and families affected by what's commonly called ""Havana syndrome,"" after the first cluster of cases were reported in Cuba's capital in late 2016. Amid some complaints that the department has not been proactive enough in addressing their health challenges or other issues, the note, obtained first by ABC News, acknowledged some shortcomings in sharing information with the department's 70,000 employees and supporting those who have been impacted. ""Those of you who've been directly affected are urgently seeking clarity. Employees going abroad are anxious about whether they or their families are at risk. That's completely understandable, and I wish we had more answers for you,"" wrote Blinken. ""We can and will do a better job keeping you informed of our efforts to get answers, support those affected, and protect our people,"" he added. President Joe Biden's National Security Council is leading a government-wide investigation into what is causing the incidents and who may be behind them. But so far, U.S. officials have few answers, nearly five years after State Department, CIA and other personnel at the U.S. Embassy in Havana reported strange experiences, like feelings of pressure or vibration and a screeching sound, and debilitating symptoms, including headaches, nausea, cognitive deficits, and trouble with seeing, hearing, or balancing. Several officials have been diagnosed with traumatic brain injuries, although it's unclear how many - just one piece of data that diplomats are seeking from the department, along with the number and location of reported incidents, CNN reported this week. Beyond Cuba, cases have been reported in several other countries, including China, Uzbekistan, Russia, Austria and the United States, although the White House has said the ""vast majority"" have been reported overseas. ""The investigation into what's causing these incidents and how we can protect our people is ongoing,"" Blinken wrote in his message. Last December, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine issued a report that concluded that ""directed, pulsed radio frequency energy appears to be the most plausible mechanism in explaining these cases, especially in individuals with the distinct early symptoms."" The CIA, State Department, and Pentagon all have their own internal task forces to address cases among their personnel and search for possible clues into the causes.

In addition, the State Department started a pilot program in June to begin recording baseline medical information of personnel and their adult family members before they move to U.S. diplomatic posts overseas. One month earlier, Deputy Secretary for Management and Resources Brian McKeon sent a cable to all staff urging them to report possible incidents or symptoms immediately, adding, ""There is no stigma associated with reporting, and that every report will be taken seriously by our health and security professionals, and the leadership of the Department."" McKeon and Spratlen have both met affected staffers and family members, but Blinken has not yet and, until Thursday, had not addressed the issue in a department-wide memo. His spokesperson Ned Price said last month that it was one of the first issues he requested a briefing on during the transition - adding, ""These health incidents have been a priority for Secretary Blinken since his day one."" CIA Director Bill Burns has met with affected personnel and made the issue a top priority, tripling the number of full-time medical personnel focused on it, he told NPR two weeks ago. While the symptoms are ""real, and it's serious,"" he added, the agency still has no definitive answers on the cause.

The U.S. government still has not reached a conclusion into the cause of the incidents, sometimes known as ""Havana syndrome"" after the first cluster of cases was reported at the U.S. embassy in Cuba. But more reported cases are now being investigated at the embassy in Austria's capital, Vienna, according to the State Department, whose spokesperson said Monday that it is ""vigorously investigating reports of possible unexplained health incidents"" among U.S. personnel there. Austria is just the latest country where incidents have now been reported. The National Security Council is overseeing a government-wide review ""to ascertain whether there may be previously unreported incidents that fit a broader pattern,"" White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Monday, and ""whether they constitute an attack of some kind by a foreign actor."" Beyond that review, the intelligence community also established the new panel of experts earlier this month -- bringing together senior officers from the CIA, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and outside scientific and medical experts -- to explore the multiple hypotheses into what is causing the ""health incidents,"" an intelligence official told ABC News. It's the latest federal government review into an issue that has vexed officials since 2016 when the first cases were reported in Cuba, underscoring how little U.S. officials still know about it. The new panel will build off of the findings of a report by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine last December, according to the official, which concluded that ""directed, pulsed radio frequency energy appears to be the most plausible mechanism in explaining these cases, especially in individuals with the distinct early symptoms."" Dozens of U.S. officials have been diagnosed with injuries, including traumatic brain injuries, after reporting strange experiences like high-pitched sounds or feelings of pressure or vibration, or debilitating symptoms including headaches, nausea, cognitive deficits, and trouble with seeing, hearing, or balancing.

Officials said they also know of some “government-affiliated cyber operators conducting ransomware operations against private companies that have included ransom demands of millions of dollars.” Senior officials said they found the MSS-affiliated ransomware attacks to be ""surprising"" and gave them ""new insights"" into how the MSS operates and the ""aggressive behavior"" coming out of China. Asked how the tactics from the Chinese differ from similar attacks they see coming out of Russia, senior officials said they sometimes see ""some connection"" between Russian intelligence services and individuals, but “the MSS use of criminal contract hackers to conduct unsanctioned cyber operations globally is distinct."" Joining the U.S. in this public announcement is the European Union, United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Japan and NATO. It’s the first time NATO has condemned Chinese cyber activities. The FBI, NSA and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency released a list Monday of tactics, procedures and techniques used by Chinese state-sponsored cyber actors. Among the trends, officials say these actors are ""using a revolving series of virtual private servers (VPSs) and common open-source or commercial penetration tools.” They are also accused of looking for ways to exploit vulnerabilities in major applications, like “Pulse Secure, Apache, F5 Big-IP, and Microsoft products."" The advisory also states that they are using a ""full array of tactics and techniques to exploit computer networks of interest worldwide and to acquire sensitive intellectual property, economic, political, and military information."" ""Countries around the world are making it clear that concerns regarding the PRC malicious cyber activity is bringing them together to call out those activities, promote network defense in cybersecurity, and act to disrupt threat to our economies and national security,"" a senior administration official said. The group will also formally attribute the Microsoft Exchange server cyberattack in March to China’s Ministry of State Security (MSS) ""with high confidence."" Asked what caused the delay for the U.S. to officially point to China for that attack, a senior administration official said they wanted to work with allies and partners because victims of this attack were not just in the U.S. Officials said they have raised these incidents with senior Chinese government officials and ""are not ruling out further actions to hold the PRC accountable,"" adding that their actions ""threaten security, confidence and stability in cyberspace."" While Monday's message of condemnation against Chinese cyber hacking came from nations around the world, the group noticeably stopped short of imposing economic sanctions or other more concrete consequences. ABC’s Rachel Scott asked White House press secretary Jen Psaki if the U.S. would take such a step alone, or whether the administration feels it would be necessary to move in concert with allies to punish China. ""Yes, we would, of course, like to work with countries and work with our key partners around the world, moving forward and you know, obviously, we can't determine steps and consequences on their behalf. But that is certainly our objective and how we've approached our strategy today,"" Psaki said. Psaki also refuted a question suggesting that the U.S. decided not to impose economic sanctions on China, because the U.S. economy depends so heavily on Chinese imports. ""My point is we are not holding back. We are not allowing any economic circumstance or consideration to prevent us from taking actions where warrant. And also, we reserve the option to take additional actions where warrant as well. This is not the conclusion of our efforts as it relates to cyber activities with China or Russia,"" Psaki insisted. Earlier, asked to compare China's hacking efforts with Russia's cyber attacks, President Biden said that while Russia may be harboring cyber criminals, China might be facilitating their attacks. ""To best of my knowledge, and I'm getting a report tomorrow morning on this, a detailed report. My understanding is that the Chinese government, not unlike the Russian government, is not doing this themselves, but are protecting those who are doing it, and maybe even accommodating them being able to do it. That may be the difference,"" Biden said. Biden also said he's not yet going farther with any punishments for China, including sanctions, because the U.S. has not finished looking into the attacks. ""They're still determining exactly what happened,"" he said of his administration officials. ""The investigation is not finished."" ABC News' Sarah Kolinovsky contributed to this report.",20,,,,4

The discussion, their first since meeting in Switzerland last month for a major summit, comes days after another massive ransomware attack affected as many as 1,500 businesses around the world, according to the software vendor that was impacted. ""I made it very clear to him that the United States expects when a ransomware operation is coming from his -- even though it's not, not sponsored by the state -- we expect him to act if we give him enough information to act on who that is,"" Biden told reporters. Biden added that there will still be U.S. consequences for such attacks, without providing details. A senior administration official said Friday the U.S. would be taking action to respond to the latest cyber attacks in the ""days and weeks ahead."" ""We're not going to telegraph what those actions will be, precisely. Some will be manifest and visible, some of them may not be, but we expect those to take place in the days and weeks ahead,"" the official said. But weeks after their Geneva summit, the president expressed optimism that the two countries, whose relations have hit a low point in recent years over a mountain of different issues, at least now had clear lines of communication. ""We have set up a means of communication now on a regular basis to be able to communicate to one another when each of us thinks something is happening in the other country that affects the home country -- and so, it went well,"" Biden said of the call. When asked what actions he wanted or expected Putin to take against the cyberattacks, Biden demurred. ""It's not appropriate for me to say what I expect him to do now. But we'll see,"" The president told reporters. The Kremlin said in its own readout that the two presidents ""stressed the need for substantive and constructive cooperation in the field of cybersecurity and the continuation of relevant contacts."" The White House has said there's no indication the Russian government is responsible for this latest ransomware attack, in which hackers from the cyber criminal group REvil infiltrated IT management companies and their corporate clients through the software vendor Kaseya. The firm said 50 of its customers were directly compromised, but as many as 1,500 businesses that rely on those 50 customers for IT security could be compromised. REvil is believed to be based in Russia or Eastern Europe and was responsible for the hack of JBS, the world's largest meat processor, that took facilities offline and affected meat supplies, including in the U.S. The group demanded a $70 million bitcoin payment from the victims of the Kaseya attack. While the Russian government may not be involved, it has consistently denied responsibility for its own cyberattacks, from its interference in the 2016 U.S. elections to the massive SolarWinds hack that affected dozens of government ministries, private companies and other entities around the world, including nearly a dozen U.S. agencies. ""Despite the readiness of the Russian side to jointly suppress criminal manifestations in the information space, no appeals on these issues have been received by the competent US agencies over the past month,"" the Kremlin said Friday. A senior administration official pushed back on the Kremlin's readout Friday afternoon. ""We have relayed multiple specific requests for action on cybercriminals, to Russia through official channels, and been clear about what Russia's responsibility is, with regard to taking action, including again today at the level of two presidents,"" they said. That language indicated a continued lack of cooperation from the Russian government on the issue.

Kaseya, an information technology and management solutions company, said 50 of its 35,000 clients were affected by a ransomware breach. ""While impacting approximately 50 of Kaseya’s customers, this attack was never a threat nor had any impact to critical infrastructure,"" the company said in a statement on Tuesday. ""Many of Kaseya’s customers are managed service providers, using Kaseya’s technology to manage IT infrastructure for local and small businesses with less than 30 employees, such as dentists’ offices, small accounting offices and local restaurants. Of the approximately 800,000 to 1,000,000 local and small businesses that are managed by Kaseya’s customers, only about 800 to 1,500 have been compromised."" It's unknown who carried out the ransomware attack on Kaseya. It's not just critical infrastructure being targeted. The Republican National Committee said one of its computer system vendors was breached by criminal cyber activity but insists that no RNC data was accessed. “Over the weekend, we were informed that Synnex, a third-party provider, had been breached. We immediately blocked all access from Synnex accounts to our cloud environment. Our team worked with Microsoft to conduct a review of our systems and after a thorough investigation, no RNC data was accessed. We will continue to work with Microsoft, as well as federal law enforcement officials on this matter,"" RNC Chief of Staff Richard Walters said in a statement to ABC News. The administration has put a renewed focus on cyber threats after a spate of ransomware attacks disrupted supply chains in various sectors, with the majority coming from hackers based in Russia. ""Even if there are criminal actors, even if it's not the Russian government that attacks our critical infrastructure or our country through cyberattacks, we reserve the option to take action if they won't do it on their own,"" White House press secretary Jen Psaki said on MSNBC Wednesday morning. ""The president reserves that option, meeting with some of his national security experts this morning to get an update, to have a discussion about ransomware, and we'll see what we learn from there."" In May, one of the nation's largest pipeline companies, Colonial Pipeline, was hit with a ransomware attack, which prompted the administration to take action. Biden signed an executive order shortly after the hack, which was aimed at modernizing the federal government's response to cyberattacks by ""improving information-sharing between the U.S. government and the private sector on cyber issues,"" improving detection of hacks into federal systems and creating a ""standardized playbook"" for how the government responds to attacks, according to the White House. In addition to the executive order, the Department of Homeland Security mandated that pipeline companies report cyber breaches to federal authorities within 12 hours. The directive came from the Transportation Security Administration. Meat supplier JBS has also been hit with a ransomware attack, forcing its meat plants to stop operations for a few days. Both JBS and Colonial Pipeline paid the ransom to get their systems back online. “I made the decision to pay, and I made the decision to keep the information about the payment as confidential as possible,” Colonial Pipeline CEO Joesph Blunt told a Senate Committee in June. ""It was the hardest decision I made in my 39 years in the energy industry, and I know how critical our pipeline is to the country, and I put the interest of the country first.”",20,,,,5
2021-06-09,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/US/cybersecurity-experts-break-cyberattack-increasing-threat/story?id=78182992,Cybersecurity experts break down a cyberattack as they become increasing threat,"The U.S. government and American businesses have found themselves on the defensive lately as cyberattacks have threatened critical infrastructure, the food supply chain and people's personal data. In hopes of preempting an attack, some businesses have hired groups, known as red teams, to hack into their systems like would-be terrorists and expose cybersecurity weaknesses. Brian Halbach and Jonathan Studebaker, two of these hackers, spoke to ""Nightline"" while ""targeting"" two different companies in two nights. ""The bad guys, they're getting more sophisticated,"" Halbach, a security consultant at RedTeam Security, said. ""They're coming up with new ways, new tricks of their trade. ... So, businesses also have to react fast and they have to think fast."" After a ransomware attack against the Metropolitan Police Department in Washington, D.C., last month, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas warned that cyberattacks, particularly ransomware attacks, had increased 300% in the past year. He said these cyberterrorists have targeted everything from government agencies to small businesses, and that $350 million in ransom had been paid for these attacks in 2020. ""We're not talking about people with a conscience,"" Mayorkas told ABC News' Pierre Thomas. ""We're talking about criminals who want to make money illegally."" Watch the full story on ""Nightline"" TONIGHT at 12:35 a.m. ET on ABC. Just this week, the Department of Justice announced that it had seized millions of dollars in Bitcoin that the Colonial Pipeline had paid as a ransom to the cybercriminal group DarkSide after last month's ransomware attack forced the company to temporarily shut down operations. ""DarkSide is a ransomware group that is believed to be based largely in Russia. ... They develop malicious code that can then be used to deploy within a network and encrypt all the data, and then supply all of the infrastructure to facilitate ransom payments, negotiation with victims, and then they basically franchise it out to lots of different affiliates,"" said Dmitri Alperovitch, former chief technology officer of cybersecurity company CrowdStrike. Colonial transports approximately 45% of all fuel consumed on the East Coast. Every day, 100 million gallons of fuel move through the pipeline between Houston and New York City. Panic-buying led Americans to rush to fill their tanks with gas as it became more expensive. Javed Ali, a former senior director of counterterrorism for the National Security Council, said there was a ""sort of anxiety of not knowing when gas supplies would come back in a neighborhood or a city."" ""So, these are all really tough, not only business decisions, but decisions that have cascading effects throughout the country,"" said Ali, who is now the Townsley Foundation policymaker in residence at the University of Michigan Ford School of Public Policy. The FBI exposed the group behind the attack as DarkSide two days after the attack had occurred. Three days later, Colonial announced that it had resumed operations. It wasn't long before the company also confirmed that it had paid the $4.4 million ransom in Bitcoin -- a decision that company CEO Joseph Blount made begrudgingly. ""I made the decision to pay and I made the decision to keep the information about the payment as confidential as possible. It was the hardest decision I've made in my 39 years in the energy industry,"" Blount told the Senate Homeland Security Committee on Tuesday. ""There are two types of companies out there: Those that know that they've been attacked and those that don't yet know that they've been hacked, and that's been the reality of the last 10 years,"" said Alperovitch. ""That continues to scale up as we're seeing the attacks become more and more disruptive and destructive."" In his interview with ABC News, Mayorkas said that fortifying cybersecurity across the country is ""not really a choice."" ""It's an imperative because the vulnerability that one has, it creates a threat not only for oneself but for many others with whom one is connected,"" he said. ""We always say in the cybersecurity realm, we're only as strong as our weakest link, because everything is connected. The vulnerability of one can become the vulnerability of many."" As more companies work to build their defenses against hackers, Halbach said red teams like his are up against hackers who are at the ""top of the top"" level of expertise. ""We [are] kind of at the point where if they want to get in, they are going to get in, and they are very persistent,"" he said. ""Essentially, they can just keep attacking and attacking and attacking, and if it doesn't work one day, they can spend three weeks doing these advanced attacks until they get in. Eventually, they will find that weakness in the armor and get in."" Their work also focuses on companies' physical security by trying to prevent bad actors from stealing devices where they're located. ""I think that oftentimes we put a lot of faith in preventing people from getting in digitally, so we'll have a firewall and we'll have antivirus and we've got all these security controls in place for the digital world,"" said Studebaker, who also previously worked for RedTeam Security. ""But in the office itself, they are usually a little bit more lax because you are going in there to work. It is a safe environment. You are there with coworkers and you think the bad guys are out -- that they are not going to come in."" ""But there is that potential that if they do have physical access, because your guard is down, because it's this nice safe space, that in some ways actually makes it more vulnerable,"" he continued. ""They could steal things like hard drives or plug into the network and get access to the entire network."" Halbach and Studebaker brought ""Nightline"" along as they tested two companies' defenses against potential hackers. The first company, Intereum Inc., is a commercial furniture supplier in Plymouth, Minnesota. With no external networks to hack, the team looked to break into the building, trudging through thick woods in the dark of the night to find a blind spot in the company's security cameras. Although they were able to break in, they were soon caught by the security cameras inside the building. Still, with their mission to expose all of the weaknesses, they continued on toward the server room, where Halbach looked to gain access to the company's servers. ""I'm connecting to their internal switch here. I'm gonna see if I can connect to an IP address to see if it lets me connect to an internal network, and poke around from there -- see what we can do on the network,"" Halbach said while executing the task. The team also carried USB drives loaded with ransomware viruses, which they planned to use on unlocked computers. When they found one that granted the USB access, Studebaker took a picture to document the potential network access. ""This is a Trojan horse that we just detonated here,"" Studebaker said at the time. ""What it did is it called out to our server and now we have remote command and control over their network."" The red team's second target was a digital security company that's also in Minnesota. In the middle of the night, the team used a device called a ""pineapple"" to attempt to deactivate Wi-Fi-enabled cameras outside the building. They also used a specialized tool they'd developed called a Pwnagotchi, modeled after the Tamagotchi toy. The device allows them to knock Wi-Fi-enabled devices off of their networks. When they attempt to reconnect, the Pwnagotchi steals their password data. Unable to break into the company's network from outside the building, the team subsequently worked their way inside, setting off alarms and capturing the attention of security cameras and motion detectors. Still, they carried on into the server room, and within 10 minutes, they had implanted a device known as a ""raspberry pi."" ""The whole point of those raspberry pis ... we would get another one of our red team members -- someone in another place or ourselves the next day -- we can remote back in and just start taking over everything,"" Halbach said. ""As much as we want, we can't steal all of their IP in a single night. We would need multiple days to exfil[trate] gigabytes, terabytes of data, out of the network."" Over the course of about three hours, the team had not only implanted the raspberry pi, but also extracted usernames and passwords from people who worked there. The engagement was scheduled to last until 3 a.m., during which time, police and fire authorities were advised not to respond to alarms. After that time, the building's true alarm system reengaged, forcing the team to make a speedy exit. After two nights of what some might consider cyber war games, both the red team and the companies that hired them walked away more aware and better prepared for hackers with malicious intentions. It's all meant to reinforce the blind spots in the defenses that they've already implemented, according to Halbach. ""A lot of times, they don't know what they don't know,"" Halbach said about companies in general. Studebaker added: ""I think the fact that they come to us as a client at all is an indicator that they want to be proactive -- that they want to be ahead of this. They don't want to be the next headline."" ABC News' Anthony Rivas, Ozren Milharcic, Jack Date, Kevin Rochford, Luke Barr and Alex Mallin contributed to this report.",20,,,,19

""We're talking about criminals who want to make money illegally or who want to do harm independent of a profit motive,"" Mayorkas said in an exclusive interview with ABC News Chief Justice Correspondent Pierre Thomas. ""We're not talking about people with conscience. For a ransomware attack to cripple a hospital and imperil the health and well-being of patients and personnel is more than unacceptable."" Mayorkas stressed, in an interview airing on ABC's Nightline Wednesday night, that every sector is vulnerable whether a business is small, medium or large. ""An integral part of our day-to-day life is based on the internet, not everybody, but so much of our country (it is),"" the secretary said. ""No one is invulnerable if they have a cyber element to their respective lives. And that speaks of the breadth and depth of the challenge."" The cost of ransomware against businesses is great -- having suffered $350 million in losses and a 300% increase in ransomware attacks, Mayorkas explained. He said that he hopes another major event, similar to the Colonial Pipeline hack, doesn't have to be the wake-up call people need to secure their systems. ""I do hope that people learn from the images that they saw of people waiting in gas lines and saying, 'wait, this is actually affecting my ability to fill my tank and get to work to be able to pick up my kids,'"" Mayorkas said. Mayorkas said he understands the complexity and difficulties that companies are facing with the decision to pay the ransom as Colonial did, but he said the government urges companies not to pay the ransom. ""That is putting profit in the pockets of the criminal and only motivating them to continue their criminal behavior. So we do not support the payment of the ransomware. But at the same time here we understand the challenge that a company faces,"" Mayorkas said. He said it is an ""obligation"" from the public to help ""cure"" some of the lack of cyber resilience that is going on in the country, and urged businesses to protect themselves. ""Businesses can do a lot, too,"" he added. ""We test our employees vigilance with respect to spearfishing exercises. We make sure that they change their passwords. We engage in multi-factor authentication and other tools."" With respect to U.S. adversaries, the secretary said Russia and China are the ones engaging in the most activity. There are red lines, he said, without elaborating, and said it was difficult to ascribe Russia's motive.",20,,,,1
2021-06-08,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/US/multiple-major-websites-reporting-outages-worldwide/story?id=78146103,"News outlets, British government site and more hit by widespread outage","A slew of high-traffic websites -- ranging from news outlets to social media platforms -- suffered simultaneous global outages early Tuesday morning. Most of the websites impacted were back up and running after the temporary hit, and the issues were linked to Fastly, a cloud-computing company that supports these sites. The company has not disclosed the cause of the outage. Reddit, Spotify, Twitch, Stack, Hulu, HBO Max, PayPal, Vimeo and Shopify were among the pages to report issues Tuesday. News outlets CNN, The Guardian, The New York Times, BBC and The Financial Times were also impacted, as well as the site for the British government. Nearly 40 websites were hit with outages at some point early Tuesday morning, according to data from the tracking site Down Detector, though it's not clear if all of them were related to the Fastly incident. Fastly reported just before 6 a.m. ET that it was investigating a ""potential impact to performance"" with its content-delivery network services. Within an hour it said it had identified the issue and was implementing a fix. Content delivery networks are an ""obscure part of the internet"" that operate ""like a mail forwarding system,"" according to David Vaskevitch, the former chief technical officer at Microsoft and current CEO of photo organization app Mylio. ""It's not exactly the same but it takes content that's used heavily all over the network and copies it to locations closer to the user,"" Vaskevitch said. ""That offloads the central server so you don't have one computer trying to do it all and it gets rid of network delays by putting the information closer to where it's going to be used."" The fix was applied at 6:36 a.m. ET, Fastly said, and approximately an hour later the company reported that the issue had been resolved globally. ""Fastly has observed recovery of all services and has resolved this incident,"" the company wrote on an incident report landing page. Though the incident was resolved quickly, it sowed widespread confusion and exposed vulnerabilities of critical websites at a time when high-profile cybersecurity breaches are on the rise. While Vaskevitch said he has ""no idea"" what caused the outage, the speed of recovery likely indicates it was an internal error versus a nefarious hack. ""There's so many things that could have happened but the fact that the system came up so quickly means that more likely it was just an unexpected mechanical problem somewhere in their system,"" Vaskevitch said. ""If hackers had gotten in there, [Fastly] may now be starting to realize the extent of the damage and then they'd be saying that they hope to know by the end of the day when they're going to be able to dig their way out of this."" Vaskevitch said he doesn't think people need to be too concerned about temporary outages like this, noting that the internet overall has proven ""very reliable."" ""Ordinary people can't predict the outage, but there are things they can do to make sure they're either not affected or to minimize the effect of an outage,"" he added, suggesting storing important data offline so it can still be accessible in the case of an outage. While Fastly stock dipped briefly during premarket trading, the quick fix seems to have ameliorated investors' concerns. By Tuesday afternoon, shares for Fastly were up nearly 7%.",20,,,,19

""Earlier today, the Department of Justice has found and recaptured the majority of the ransom Colonial paid to the DarkSide network in the wake of last month's ransomware attack. Ransomware attacks are always unacceptable -- but when they target critical infrastructure, we will spare no effort in our response,"" Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco said at a news conference. ""Today, we turned the tables on DarkSide,"" she said. ""By going after the entire ecosystem that fuels ransomware and digital extortion attacks, including criminal proceeds in the form of digital currency, we will continue to use all of our tools, and all of our resources to increase the cost and the consequences of ransomware attacks and other cyber-enabled attacks."" The Colonial Pipeline hack was carried out by DarkSide actors, the FBI said in brief statement days after the attack. At the time of the attack, President Joe Biden said the hackers were based in Russia, but were not part of the Russian government. Colonial transports approximately 45% of all fuel consumed on the East Coast. The company was up and running within days, but the slowdown meant delays still remained in the aftermath of the attack. In May, the company admitted it paid million ransom in Bitcoin cryptocurrency. ""We needed to do everything in our power to restart the system quickly and safely. The decision was made to pay the ransom,"" the company said. ""This decision was not made lightly, however, one that had to be made. Tens of millions of Americans rely on Colonial -- hospitals, emergency medical services, law enforcement agencies, fire departments, airports, truck drivers and the traveling public. Our focus remains on continued operations to safely deliver refined products to communities we serve.” The company's CEO said last month in an interview that he authorized a payment of $4.3 million to the DarkSide group only hours after the company learned of the attack because executives were not sure how long it might take to bring the pipeline back on. The full amount of the seizure from DarkSide, DOJ officials said Monday, was 63.7 bitcoins valued at approximately $2.3 million. News of the seizure was first reported by CNN. Asked by ABC News whether the seizure would really operate as a deterrent for other hacking groups given it only amounts to roughly half of what Colonial paid in ransom and, given the group operates out of Russia, will not likely face criminal consequences for the attack -- Monaco said she ""wouldn't get ahead of the investigative efforts and full consequences associated with the ongoing investigation. ""The message today is we will bring all of our tools to bear, to go after these criminal networks, including the ecosystem and the illicit and the abuse, frankly, of the online infrastructure that they use in terms of the digital currency to perpetrate these schemes,"" she said. Monaco also used Monday's announcement to urge companies to take preemptive action. ""In this heightened threat landscape, we all have a role to play in keeping our nation safe. No organization is immune. So today I want to emphasize to leaders of corporations and communities alike, the threat of severe ransomware attacks pose a clear and present danger to your organization, to your company, to your customers, to your shareholders, and to your long-term success,"" she warned. ""So pay attention now. Invest resources now. Failure to do so could be the difference between being secure now, or a victim later,"" she said. In an effort to get more cooperation from companies, the Department of Homeland Security announced shortly after Colonial Pipeline was hacked that it will mandate that all pipeline companies report a cyber incident hours after it happens. The directive came from the Transportation Security Administration, an arm of DHS known for protecting the skies that also oversees pipeline security. Companies will be mandated to report pipeline related cyberattacks to the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Administration within 12 hours of the breach; put in place a 24/7 cyber coordinator who can respond to incidents and coordinate with the TSA; and fix the breached pipeline within 30 days and outline a plan to proceed.",20,,,,19
2021-06-04,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/ufo-intel-report-reach-definitive-conclusion-adding-mystery/story?id=78084857,"UFO intel report will not reach definitive conclusion, adding to mystery over sightings","American officials investigating the UFO sightings by Navy pilots in recent years have not reached a definitive explanation for the unidentified aerial phenomena, or UAPs, as they've come to be known, three U.S. officials confirmed to ABC News -- adding a new layer of mystery to the interstellar drama ahead of an upcoming report on the matter. Investigators compiling a report to Congress due later this month are said to have found no evidence to suggest the UAPs are linked to alien spacecraft, nor are they in a position to explain what has been reported by U.S. military pilots in encounters over the years, the three officials said. One of the officials told ABC News that some of the dozens of incidents involving UAPs were able to be explained, for example as weather balloons or as atmospheric conditions, but other incidents were not able to be explained. A fourth official said that investigators have also ruled out the possibility that UAPs are related to any secret U.S. military technology, or so-called ""black programs."" At the Pentagon, a top spokesman declined to comment on press reports about what was included in the upcoming report. ""I'm not going to get ahead of a report that hasn't been filed to Congress, and I'm certainly not going to speak about intelligence issues here from the podium,"" said John Kirby, the Pentagon's top spokesman. ""I've seen the press reporting, but I'm not going to be able to comment beyond that."" Kirby said the UAPs are taken seriously since safety concerns have been raised by incursions into aerial training areas where some of the incidents were documented. The spokesman also confirmed that Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin has been briefed on the progress of the report. Meanwhile, weapons experts are casting doubt on the possibility that the sightings are hypersonic technology belonging to America's foreign adversaries. These developments further muddle the list of possible explanations for UAP sightings, which have consumed the national conversation in anticipation of a report due later this month from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and a Pentagon task force focused on the issue. In the absence of answers, experts and former government officials have coalesced around two competing theories for the UAP sightings: they could either be extraterrestrial in nature, or they could be experimental military materiel belonging to Russia or China. Mick Mulroy, a former deputy assistant secretary of defense and retired CIA officer, said that either way, ""these need to be investigated."" ""These objects appear to exceed our military capabilities,"" said Mulroy, now an ABC News contributor. ""We need to determine who this is and what capabilities they possess. It is never a good thing to discover you are vastly behind in technology. From a national security perspective, we cannot presume benevolence – whether terrestrial in origin or not."" A New York Times report cited a U.S. official as suggesting that the UAPs could be Russian or Chinese military assets experimenting with hypersonic aircraft or weapons – advanced technology that would allow objects to fly at unfathomable speeds. In recent years, both China and Russia have ""accelerated"" their hypersonic research and development programs, according to a report prepared by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service in April. The race for hypersonic technology is high stakes, and experts fear the Chinese and the Russians are making progress. ""Open-source reporting indicates that both China and Russia have conducted numerous successful tests of hypersonic glide vehicles and likely fielded an operational capability,"" the report read. Weapons experts, however, are wary of a hypersonic explanation for the UAP anomalies. ""I would be very skeptical about the hypersonic theory,"" said Pavel Podvig, a senior researcher specializing in advanced weapons at the United Nations. Video evidence of the UAPs released by the Pentagon shows Tic Tac-shaped objects flying at superfast speeds and abruptly changing directions. Lt. Ryan Graves, an F/A-18 Super Hornet pilot, told the CBS News program ""60 Minutes"" last month that he saw the objects ""every day for at least a couple of years"" off the Atlantic coast. David Fravor, another naval aviator, described a 2004 encounter he had with one of the Tic Tac-shaped UAPs off the coast of southern California. ""The Tic Tac's still pointing north-south, it goes, click, and just turns abruptly. And starts mirroring me. So as I'm coming down, it starts coming up,"" Fravor said. ""And it's climbing still. And when it gets right in front of me, it just disappears."" Kelley Sayler, the author of the Congressional Research Service report, told ABC News that she is ""not aware of any hypersonic weapon or aircraft that behaves in the manner depicted in the videos."" Podvig, the U.N. researcher, echoed that sentiment. ""Any object moving at hypersonic speed would generate a strong infrared signature, which doesn't seem to be visible in images of these UAPs,"" Podvig explained. ""It would also create a shock wave and sonic boom, which doesn't seem to happen in these images, either. Further, a hypersonic object would not be very maneuverable -- it can change a trajectory somewhat, but cannot do sudden turns, not to mention stops,"" Podvig said. With no clear earth-bound explanation for the UAPs -- and with the recent dismissal of some previously accepted alternative theories – so-called ufologists have elevated the prospect that these unexplained sightings reflect extraterrestrial interactions. Christopher Mellon, a former Pentagon official who has led the charge for further investigation into the UAPs, tweeted on Friday that ""It is likely that there is not a single explanation for all of this."" For its part, White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters Friday that the report is ""not in the conclusion phase, as I understand."" ""I will say that we take reports of encouragement incursions into our airspace by any aircraft identified or unidentified very seriously and investigate each one,"" she said. She said President Joe Biden had not been briefed on the upcoming report.",20,,,,0
2021-05-28,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/US/kremlin-rejects-microsoft-allegations-carried-hack-state-department/story?id=77958843,Kremlin rejects new Microsoft allegations it carried out hack via State Department email,"The Kremlin has dismissed new allegations from Microsoft that Russian state hackers seized control of the email system of the State Department's international aid agency in order to target dozens of other organizations in the United States and around the world, including human rights groups and other critics of President Vladimir Putin's government. Microsoft on Thursday said the new attack was carried out by the same group of Russian hackers behind the SolarWinds hack of the federal government which has been linked to Russia's foreign intelligence agency, the SVR. The new cyberattack comes only three weeks before a planned summit between Putin and President Joe Biden, who just a month ago imposed sanctions on Russia after the Solar Winds hack. The Kremlin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov on Friday said the allegations from Microsoft were ""unfounded"" and ""abstract"" and said he did not believe it would affect the summit. ""It's an abstract statement. It's like if we said we believe a large threat is coming from Microsoft and the software. It will be the same unfounded accusation,"" Peskov said in a daily briefing call with reporters. Microsoft has said the new attack saw the Russian hackers gain access to an email account belonging to the United States Agency for International Development. From there they were able to then send 3,000 phishing emails to around 150 government agencies, think tanks and NGOs, the company said in a blog post published Thursday. Microsoft said it had observed the attack this week by the group, which it dubs ""Nobelium."" It judged that the goal of the attack appeared to be an intelligence gathering effort by the Russian hackers by targeting government agencies involved in foreign policy. ""These attacks appear to be a continuation of multiple efforts by Nobelium to target government agencies involved in foreign policy as part of intelligence gathering efforts,"" the company said. The attack resembled the Solar Winds hack in that it targeted a third-party private service provider in order to gain access to government agencies, in what is known as a ""supply chain"" attack. In the wake of the Solar Winds attack, Biden signed an executive order that placed new standards for cybersecurity for any software sold to the federal government. In the new attack the Russian hackers gained access to the U.S. Agency for International Development's Constant Contact account, an email marketing service, according to Microsoft. The hackers were then able to send out authentic-looking phishing emails which included a link that if clicked would insert malware into the victim's computer. The malware gave hackers broad capabilities within the system, ranging from from stealing data to infecting other computers on a network, Microsoft said. ""By piggybacking on software updates and now mass email providers,"" the company wrote, the Russian hackers increased ""the chances of collateral damage in espionage operations and undermines trust in the technology ecosystem."" The White House says it, too, is ""aware of the phishing incident"" that impacted USAID and is ""monitoring the situation closely"" -- but noted that so far, the impact ""appears to be limited."" A spokesperson for the White House's National Security Council said: ""NSC is aware of the phishing incident and we are monitoring the situation closely. CISA is actively managing this incident and working with USAID."" The spokesperson said that ""at this time, there appears to be limited impact."" ""We note Microsoft's blog pointing out that many of these emails are likely to have been blocked by automated systems,"" the spokesperson said. ""Improving cybersecurity technology and defenses is the foundational step to fighting cyber attacks."" While Microsoft said in a blog post that a Russian state-backed hacking group, Nobelium, was behind the cyberattack, U.S. intelligence has not yet attributed the attack to anyone. In a statement, USAID acting spokesperson Pooja Jhunjhunwala told ABC News that the government's ""forensic investigation"" is still ongoing. ""The agency has notified and is working with all appropriate Federal authorities,"" added Jhunjhunwala, including the Department of Homeland Security and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency. Biden had sought to signal to Russia that it could pay a more substantial price for such attacks with the sanctions package in April. The measures included expelling 10 Russian diplomats, imposing new restrictions on purchasing Russia's sovereign debt and also sanctioned several Russian cybersecurity companies, among other steps. Russia in retaliation expelled 10 American diplomats and asked the U.S. ambassador to Moscow to return home for an unspecified period for consultations.",20,,,,5

The ransomware attack began overnight, targeting Ireland's Health Service Executive which said it had decided to shut down most of its IT systems as a precaution. Many hospitals and clinics reported on Friday they had lost access to their computer systems -- suddenly shut out of patients' records, appointment booking and email systems -- prompting some to cancel most non-urgent appointments. Those facilities said they had contingency plans in place; medical equipment was not impacted; and care was being given as normal to patients. The health service said the attack was also significantly disrupting Ireland's coronavirus testing program, although it said that its vaccination rollout was not affected. ""It's widespread. It is very significant, and possibly the most significant cybercrime attack on the Irish State,"" Ossian Smith, a state minister for procurement and eCommerce told the national broadcaster RTE on Friday. Smith told RTE that the attack was ""not espionage"" and was the work of a criminal gang seeking to extort money from the country. He said the attack went ""right to the core"" of the health service and that Ireland was now ""deploying everything"" in response. He said Ireland's National Cyber Security Center and police were assisting in containing the attack and launching an investigation into the criminals responsible. Ireland has requested help from Interpol with the investigation. The attack blindsides Ireland's health system amid the coronavirus pandemic and comes amid heightened attention to the threat posed by ransomware attacks following the hack of Colonial Pipeline in the United States that has wrought havoc on fuel supplies. Paul Reid, the head of the Health Service Executive, told RTE radio that it had shut down its systems as a precautionary measure allow to specialists to contain the ransomware and assess the damage. The Irish government's chief information officer said it was working to ensure that ransomware had not spread to any other government networks and that for the time being that did not appear to have happened. Smith said the National Cyber Security Center was now working through the health service's systems by ""clearing through each section, each subunit of the network, and when it's safe, they're reopening."" He said that would continue throughout the weekend, ""and possibly longer,"" The attack disrupted the Ireland health care system's ability to offer outpatient care, forcing some hospitals to suspend many key services, including cancer and stroke treatments as well as testing, such as CT scans. Fergal Malone, the head of Dublin's The Rotunda maternity hospital, said the facility had had to shut down its computer systems after learning they were affected overnight. That meant the hospital had had to revert to paper systems for administration, a slower process he said, resulting in the cancellation of non-urgent appointments, except those for women over 36 weeks pregnant. But for the hospital itself, he said it was able to function “absolutely normally"" for the patients already there. “All patients in the hospital are safe, all care is being provided,” Malone said. Several other major hospitals said they were also seriously affected and canceled non-urgent appointments, although others continued to receive people. The health service's chief operating officer, Anne O'Connor said that if the attack was not overcome by Monday ""we will be in a very serious situation and we will be cancelling many services."" O'Connor said the attack was carried out using ""a brand new variant of the Conti ransomware,"" a type of ransomware known to cybersecurity researchers and different to that involved in the Colonial Pipeline attack. Conti is a so-called ""double extortion"" ransomware, which means that as well as locking victims out of their systems, the malware also steals data, which the criminals then threaten to release if they are not paid. Russian cybersecurity firm, Kaspersky listed Conti as nNo 2 on its list of top ransomware groups and estimates that it accounted for 13% of all ransomware attacks from late 2019 through 2020. Some security researchers have linked Conti to cyber criminal gang believed to operate from Russia. Last month reports emerged that Conti ransomware hackers had encrypted the systems of the Broward County Public School District in Florida and demanded $40 million in ransom. The hackers released some files after the school said it would not pay the amount.",20,,,,19
2021-05-11,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/cisa-obtain-technical-information-colonial-pipeline-hack/story?id=77620866,CISA yet to obtain 'technical information' on Colonial Pipeline hack,"The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) does not have the ""technical information"" on the Colonial Pipeline ransomware attack, the acting director told a congressional panel Tuesday. Colonial Pipeline said on Saturday it was the victim of a cyberattack involving ransomware and had ""proactively"" halted all pipeline operations as a result. The 5,500-mile pipeline system transports approximately 45% of all fuel consumed on the East Coast, according to its website, and runs from Texas to New Jersey. CISA, an arm of the Department of Homeland Security, is responsible for the nation's cyber infrastructure. Brandon Wales, the acting director of CISA, told lawmakers on the Senate Homeland Security Committee that once the agency gets the information, it will be used to help protect other companies. ""We do expect information to come from that and when we have it, we will use it to help improve cybersecurity more broadly,"" he testified. Wales also admitted that the company did not directly reach out to the agency in the moments following the cyber attack. ""We were brought in by the FBI after they were notified about the incident,"" he said. ""I think there is a benefit when CISA is brought in quickly because the information that we glean, we work to share it in a bigger fashion to protect other critical infrastructure,"" he explained. The FBI said in a statement Monday it had been confirmed that DarkSide ransomware was responsible for the compromise of the Colonial Pipeline networks. The FBI added that it will continue to work with the company and government partners on the ongoing investigation. The DarkSide criminal organization allegedly operates in Eastern Europe. While federal officials are still trying to determine whether a foreign nation could be involved in the cyberattack, Russian intelligence has been known to cooperate with Eastern European cybercriminals in the past. President Joe Biden said Monday there is currently ""no evidence"" that Russia is involved in the cyber attack. ""Although, there is evidence that the actors’ ransomware is in Russia,"" the president added. ""They have some responsibility to deal with this."" Wales also said it ""is not surprising"" that DarkSide went after a company like Colonial Pipeline. ""We've seen this over the past two years, they're going after bigger players they get bigger ransoms. Ransoms last year went up to around $300,000 For the small ones and millions of dollars for the big ones,"" he said. Wales got into the challenges in federal government cybersecurity, which is a combination of a lack of updating systems, hiring the right people and that tactics are changing at a fast clip. He urged Congress to add more funding to CISA's budget. Ranking Member Rob Portman said the Colonial Pipeline hack shows how cyber incidents can have real world impacts. ""This is a stark example of how the cyberattacks can have real demonstrable impacts on our economy international security, ask the people who are in East Coast states about what they're paying for gasoline today at the pump, and they will tell you it has impact,"" he said. ABC News' Catherine Thorbecke contributed to this report.",20,,,,19
2021-05-11,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/top-us-official-hoard-gas-amid-pipeline-shutdown/story?id=77627452,Energy secretary: No need to hoard gasoline amid pipeline shutdown,"The Biden administration on Tuesday warned that southeastern states faced a gasoline ""supply crunch"" following the ransomware attack on the Colonial Pipeline, as several states declared emergencies or suspended rules and one major airline altered its flight routes. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm said that Colonial Pipeline's chief executive had indicated the company would decide by the close of business on Wednesday whether it could fully restart the pipeline, but that even if it did, ""it will take a few days to ramp up operations."" ""Much as there was no cause for, say, hoarding toilet paper at the beginning of the pandemic,"" Granholm told reporters, ""there should be no cause for hoarding gasoline, especially in light of the fact that the pipeline should be substantially operational by the end of this week and over the weekend."" Top federal officials encouraged calm, even as Virginia's governor on Tuesday declared a state of emergency to ""prepare for any potential supply shortages."" His counterpart in North Carolina did the same the day before, while in Georgia, the governor suspended the gas tax and weight limits on trucks transporting fuel. Anecdotally, some gas stations across the southeast faced long lines as motorists stocked up on gas. Granholm said during a news conference at the White House that the federal government would investigate reports of gasoline price gouging and that any ""crunch"" would be short-lived. ""It's not that we have a gasoline shortage,"" Granholm said in an exchange with ABC News Senior White House Correspondent Mary Bruce. ""It's that we have this supply crunch, and that things will be back to normal soon, and that we’re asking people not to hoard."" She added: ""We have gasoline. We just have to get it to the right places."" In the meantime, the secretary said, ""the crunch"" would be felt in the southeast, where much of the Colonial Pipeline is located. The 5,500-mile pipeline system transports approximately 45% of all fuel consumed on the East Coast, according to its website, and runs from Texas to New Jersey. ""It’s about 70% of the supplies of North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Georgia, and especially southern Virginia,"" that, Granholm said, ""are impacted the most.” The FBI said Monday that the DarkSide criminal organization, which operates in Eastern Europe, was allegedly behind the attack. The attack on the Colonial Pipeline ""could prove to be the most devastating ransomware attack on critical infrastructure systems in the U.S. to date,"" according to a bulletin issued Monday by the Department of Homeland Security’s regional office in Boston. While federal officials are still trying to determine whether a foreign nation could be involved in the cyberattack, Russian intelligence has been known to cooperate with Eastern European cybercriminals in the past. President Joe Biden said Monday that the attack was a ""criminal act."" “So far, there is no evidence, based on -- from our Intelligence people that Russia is involved,” Biden told reporters. “Although, there is evidence that the actors’ ransomware is in Russia. They have some responsibility to deal with this.” ABC News' Luke Barr and Josh Margolin contributed to this report.",20,,,,19
2021-05-10,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/US/colonial-pipeline-ransomware-cyberattack/story?id=77599757,What we know about the Colonial Pipeline ransomware cyberattack,"A cybersecurity attack targeting operators of a major East Coast fuel pipeline has left the nation reeling, exposing the vulnerabilities of critical infrastructure to new threats while also leaving many Americans with more questions than answers. Colonial Pipeline said on Saturday that it was the victim of a cyberattack involving ransomware and had ""proactively"" halted all pipeline operations as a result. The 5,500-mile pipeline system transports approximately 45% of all fuel consumed on the East Coast, according to its website, and runs from Texas to New Jersey. President Joe Biden acknowledged the ransomware attack during remarks on Monday, saying his administration has been tracking the incident ""extremely carefully"" and that he has been ""personally briefed every day"" on it. Eric Goldstein, the executive assistant director for cybersecurity at the Department of Homeland Security’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), told ABC News in an interview on Monday that Americans should not expect any ""shortfalls"" from the hack. ""They expect resolution of this issue in the near future and shortfalls that will affect the American people are not anticipated,"" Goldstein said. Here is what to know about the Colonial Pipeline cyberattack, including the latest on who is behind it and how it could potentially impact gas prices. The Federal Bureau of Investigation confirmed in a statement Monday that Darkside ransomware was responsible for the compromise of the Colonial Pipeline networks. The FBI added that it will continue to work with the company and government partners on the ongoing investigation. The Darkside criminal organization operates in Eastern Europe. While federal officials are still trying to determine whether a foreign nation could be involved in the cyberattack, Russian intelligence has been known to cooperate with Eastern European cybercriminals in the past. ""It is always a concern when any adversary, nation state or criminal group targets an American business or critical infrastructure and particularly, although not exclusively, when that effort results in disruption of a critical function or service,"" CISA's Goldstein told ABC News. ""We are deeply focused on making sure that every organization in this country takes steps to minimize the risks to their networks and has the ability to recover quickly, regardless of the actors involved, because we know that there are so many groups out there that are attempting these kind of intrusions,"" he added. Goldstein did not say whether authorities have identified Darkside as working for a foreign country. President Biden said during remarks Monday that there is currently ""no evidence"" that Russia is involved in the cyberattack. ""Although, there is evidence that the actors’ ransomware is in Russia,"" the president added. ""They have some responsibility to deal with this."" Colonial Pipeline said in a statement Monday that it is executing a phased plan to incrementally return to service, with ""the goal of substantially restoring operational service by the end of the week."" The company said it will be providing updates as the restoration efforts progress. ""Restoring our network to normal operations is a process that requires the diligent remediation of our systems, and this takes time,"" the company said. ""In response to the cybersecurity attack on our system, we proactively took certain systems offline to contain the threat, which temporarily halted all pipeline operations, and affected some of our IT systems. To restore service, we must work to ensure that each of these systems can be brought back online safely."" Patrick DeHaan, the head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy, told ABC News Monday that the pipeline shutdown will likely not impact the price at the pump for most Americans. ""It certainly creates some logistical challenges in the Southeast, and it may create price increases modestly in the Southeast, but there is not an impending spike coming nationally,"" he said. ""This is not an outage of a refinery that produces gasoline and so supply is not disrupted for the rest of the nation that is not served by the Colonial Pipeline."" ""This is evolving, but for now this is not going to be a national issue or have a national effect on gas prices,"" he added. DeHaan predicts that motorists along the Southeast, from northern Florida to Virginia, may see slight increases of between 5 to 15 cents per gallon at most. For now, DeHaan recommends that drivers in these areas conserve as much as possible, which could help ""bring a much more rapid conclusion to this once the pipeline reopens."" ""My advice to motorists is not to panic buy and make the situation much worse,"" DeHaan added. ""If motorists do panic and rush out to fill up that could make prices spike more significantly and make outages more severe."" Homeland Security Advisor and Deputy National Security Advisor Elizabeth Sherwood-Randal said during a White House press briefing Monday that the Biden administration is assisting Colonial through a ""whole of government effort"" involving a slew of agencies being led by the Department of Energy. ""Colonial is responsible for safely returning the pipeline to service, and our role in the federal government is to take proactive steps to analyze the impacts of the shutdown on the delivery of gasoline, diesel and aviation fuel in states that are dependent on the pipeline, and to identify federal options for alleviating supply shortfalls, should they develop,"" Sherwood-Randal said. ""For example, to help address potential supply disruptions, the Department of Transportation issued an hours-of-service waiver yesterday, which provides greater flexibility to drivers transporting gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, and other refined petroleum products across 17 states as well as the District of Colombia,"" she added. She emphasized there is not a supply shortage currently. Deputy National Security Advisor for Cyber and Emerging Technologies Anne Neuberg said at the same press briefing that they are ""actively engaged with the company and offering support as needed to restore their systems."" ""Right now, they've not asked for cyber support from the federal government, but we remain available to meet their cybersecurity needs,"" she added. Neuberg demurred when asked if Colonial had paid a ransom to the hackers, saying, ""Colonial is a private company, and we’ll defer information regarding their decision on paying a ransom to them.""",20,,,,19
2021-05-07,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/white-house-acknowledges-mysterious-health-attacks-occurred-us/story?id=77562804,"White House acknowledges mysterious health attacks occurred in US, reviewing intel on incidents","The mysterious health incidents that have affected dozens of U.S. personnel around the globe have also occurred within the United States, the White House confirmed for the first time on Friday. The source of the illnesses, known as ""Havana syndrome"" after the first cluster of cases at the U.S. Embassy in Cuba, is still unknown. But there is growing pressure from Congress to figure out what has affected so many U.S. diplomats, spies and other officials -- and who or what is behind it. ""At this point, at this moment, we don't know the cause of these incidents, which are both limited in nature and the vast majority of which have been reported overseas,"" said White House press secretary Jen Psaki, acknowledging the newly reported cases in the U.S. The Biden administration has launched a review of U.S. intelligence to determine if there are other previously unreported cases and if there is a ""broader pattern,"" a National Security Council spokesperson confirmed to ABC News. Last month, U.S. defense officials briefed lawmakers on the Senate and House Armed Services Committees on several previously unreported incidents of U.S. personnel falling sick after alleged exposures, congressional sources confirmed to ABC News. Dozens of Americans have been diagnosed with a range of symptoms, including traumatic brain injuries, with several describing bizarre experiences like strange noises and sensations. The U.S. government has acknowledged cases in Cuba, China, Uzbekistan and Russia -- but there are media reports of other countries now, too. The issue has vexed U.S. officials since 2016, when the first cases were reported at the embassy in Havana. While there's still no definitive answer, the National Academies of Science in December issued a report, commissioned by the State Department, that concluded the most likely source is ""directed, pulsed radio frequency energy."" Among the possible new cases are also reportedly at least two incidents in the Washington area, according to GQ magazine, CNN and others. ABC News has not independently verified those reports. ""This pattern of attacking our fellow citizens serving our government appears to be increasing,"" the top Democrat and Republican on the Senate Intelligence Committee, Mark Warner of Virginia and Marco Rubio of Florida, warned in a statement last week. While Warner and Rubio praised President Joe Biden's CIA director, Bill Burns, for his ""renewed focus on these attacks,"" other lawmakers have become publicly exasperated with the executive branch's response. During a Senate hearing last week, Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., criticized the U.S. intelligence community's ""clamp down on information that's available to Congress, that's available to the public."" That, in turn, has led to a growing number of reports of alleged incidents without clarity about whether or not they're related to what's happened to U.S. personnel in Cuba, Shaheen said. ""It's not clear whether the information we're getting is correct or incorrect,"" she told Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines. ""The horse is out of the barn on this. The information is already out there, and I think it behooves us all to try to make sure that the information that gets out is accurate and that people understand what's happening."" Beyond Cuba, the State Department has previously acknowledged incidents in China, Uzbekistan and one redacted country in an internal report that was declassified and released in February. That unknown country is likely Russia, where a former CIA official said he was attacked. That official, Marc Polymeropoulos, told ABC News in March that he's now receiving treatment at Walter Reed Medical Center for a traumatic brain injury as well. But after reports of possible incidents in Syria, the head of U.S. Central Command said he had no evidence that was true. ""I have found no evidence of those attacks"" in CENTCOM's region, which includes Syria, Gen. Frank McKenzie, CENTCOM commander, told a Senate panel in April. During the same hearing, Gen. Stephen Townsend, head of U.S. Africa Command, added he's ""not seen that phenomenon in Africa"" either. One law enforcement source dismissed speculation about one incident in the Washington area, telling ABC News, ""There is no credible evidence to support this."" Biden's National Security Council is now conducting ""a full review of intelligence reporting to ascertain whether there may be previously unreported incidents that fit a broader pattern,"" a spokesperson confirmed to ABC News Friday. While the Trump administration initially said affected personnel had suffered ""health attacks,"" the spokesperson added that whether the incidents are an attack and whether they're the work of a foreign actor are still under ""active inquiry.""

2021-05-04,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/US/phony-coronavirus-vaccine-site-shut-federal-agents/story?id=77473994,Phony coronavirus vaccine site shut down by federal agents,"Federal investigators announced Monday they seized a website that they say fraudulently offered coronavirus vaccines in order to allegedly steal users' personal information. The U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Maryland seized freevaccinecovax.org, which purported to be the website of an actual biotechnology company and used trademarked logos from Pfizer, the World Health Organization and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. The site collected user's personal data ""in order to use the information for nefarious purposes, including fraud, phishing attacks, and/or deployment of malware,"" the U.S. Attorney's Office said. ""Members of the public should not provide personal information or click on links in unsolicited e-mails and should remember that the COVID-19 vaccine is not for sale. The Federal government is providing the vaccine free of charge to people living in the United States,"" Acting U.S. Attorney Jonathan F. Lenzner said in a statement. An analysis of the site by the United States Department of Homeland Security investigations indicated the domain name was created on April 27 using an IP address located in Strasbourg, France, and the registrant country was listed as Russia, according to the U.S. Attorney's Office. The fraudulent website contained a ""Select your city"" drop-down menu and ""Apply"" and ""Upload application"" buttons, according to the U.S. Attorney's Office. After a user selected a city and clicked ""Apply,"" a PDF file written in Cyrillic was downloaded to their computer, and they were instructed to fill it out and upload it back onto the site, federal investigators said. ""Individuals visiting the site will now see a message that the site has been seized by the federal government and be redirected to another site for additional information,"" the U.S. Attorney's Office said in a news release. The federal government has seized nine websites that sought to illegally profit off the pandemic, Lenzner said. The other fraudulent sites offered vaccines and COVID-19 antibody treatments, according to investigators.

""We are aware of unauthorized access on our server,"" the Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia said in a statement to ABC News on Monday. ""While we determine the full impact and continue to review activity, we have engaged the FBI to fully investigate this matter."" Javed Ali, a former national counterterrorism director at the National Security Council, said the apparent ransomware attack ""underscores the cyber vulnerabilities criminal groups and other malign actors continue to exploit."" ""Various sectors across state and local governments have been targeted, including law enforcement agencies, hospital systems and educational facilities due to shortcomings in cyber defenses and other information technology gaps,"" Ali told ABC News. ""Further, the lack of national-level standards on cybersecurity for key governmental functions at the state and local level complicates efforts to prevent these types of attacks or mitigate their effects."" The Metropolitan Police Department has over 4,000 sworn and civilian members serving Washington, D.C., making it one of the 10 largest local police agencies in the United States, according to its website. Although investigators have not attributed the server breach to Russian hackers, federal authorities issued a warning earlier this week about continued cyber attacks by Russia to exploit networks in the wake of the so-called SolarWinds hack. In December, it was discovered that at least nine federal agencies were breached by what the U.S. government believes are Russian actors through software from Texas-based company SolarWinds. In a statement posted on its website, SolarWinds said in December that it had provided two hotfix updates with security enhancements and that it would continue ""to work with leading security experts in our investigations to help further secure our products and internal systems."" The FBI, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency said in an assessment Monday that Russian hackers ""will continue to seek intelligence from U.S. and foreign entities through cyber exploitation, using a range of initial exploitation techniques that vary in sophistication, coupled with stealthy intrusion tradecraft within compromised networks."" The federal agencies said the Russians ""primarily target government networks, think tank and policy analysis organizations, and information technology companies."" According to the assessment, the Russians used tradecraft similar to SolarWinds and utilized the software to get into other networks and target individual emails at specific companies. The federal agencies urged companies to use multi-factor authentication and deploy monitoring techniques for internal networks. ""The FBI suspects the actors monitored IT staff to collect useful information about the victim networks, determine if victims had detected the intrusions, and evade eviction actions,"" the agencies said. The FBI did not immediately respond to ABC News' request for comment.",20,,,,5
2021-04-19,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/International/russia-moves-troops-ukraine-analysts-explain-buildup/story?id=77165952,Russia moves troops near Ukraine: Analysts explain what's behind the buildup,"For weeks, Russia has been massing troops close to Ukraine in a military buildup on a scale not seen since its invasion in 2014. Analysts, as well as Ukrainian and Western officials, have struggled to understand what the Russian buildup means: It is simply posturing intended to send a message to Ukraine and the Biden administration, or is it genuine preparations for Russian military action or even a full-scale invasion of Ukraine? Right now, only the Kremlin knows the answer. But most observers have concluded for now that the highly visible build-up is most likely saber-rattling, though the threat of escalation still can’t be ruled out. “In general, the situation is better now than it was a week before,” Oleksiy Semeniy, a former adviser to the secretary of Ukraine's national security and defense council, said in an interview on Friday. “I would say that actually the percentage of some kind of real war or even mid-size military conflict -- be it on the line or be on the border -- is low,” he said. “It does not mean the situation cannot change.” The conflict in eastern Ukraine has been at a low intensity since 2015, when a peace agreement ended major fighting. That peace process has been deadlocked more or less ever since, leaving parts of eastern Ukraine under the rule of Russian-controlled separatists who face off down a frontline with Ukrainian government forces. The separatist areas are nominally self-declared republics, but in practice are effectively controlled by Moscow, which has so far stopped short of recognizing them. Since late March, Russian social media has been full of videos showing trainloads of armored vehicles and heavy artillery moving into Crimea and close to eastern Ukraine. That has been accompanied by a barrage of warlike rhetoric on Russian state media. At the same time, a ceasefire in eastern Ukraine between Russian-controlled rebels there and the Kyiv government has collapsed, with an upsurge in firing. Estimates of the number of Russian troops deployed near Ukraine now range from around 60,000 to over 100,000, though many of those are permanently stationed there. Russia’s defense minister has said it moved two armies and three airborne units to its southwestern border, saying the buildup is part of a “readiness check” in response to alleged increased activity by the United States and NATO forces. Russia has set up a large new field base for hundreds of vehicles, visible on commercially available satellite imagery, and foreign journalists have been allowed to get close by. Most observers say they believe the very visible nature of the Russian buildup means it’s intended to be seen, which suggests it is a message, not a prelude to an invasion. “We were and are spectators of a show, which many have been taking -- and are still taking -- for reality,” Dmitry Trenin, the director of Carnegie Moscow Center, said in an interview with Russian website 47News. Many observers believe that show is intended to send signals to both Ukraine and the Biden administration. To Ukraine, Trenin said, it’s a warning against any attempt to use military force to retake its occupied territories and also to express dissatisfaction over a recent shift by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky toward a more assertive stance against pro-Russian groups in the country. To the U.S., Trenin said the message was likewise a warning to keep tight control over Kyiv, which the Kremlin sees as dominated by the U.S. Other analysts say they believe it was meant as an early test for the Biden administration and as a message from the Kremlin that it can reignite the conflict at will if its interests are ignored. The moves have succeeded in attracting the West’s attention. President Joe Biden called Russian President Vladimir Putin and offered him a summit meeting in the coming months, something analysts say Putin eagerly seeks. Some analysts said they believed the Kremlin had seized on more assertive moves by Kyiv recently in order to make its points. The escalation began when Zelensky banned three pro-Russian media channels and sanctioned a powerful oligarch often described as Putin’s point man in Ukraine. Zelensky also conducted military exercises close to the front. “Even though Kyiv’s moves at that time were not preparations for a military offensive,” Trenin wrote in a recent article, “The Kremlin decided to seize upon them to raise the stakes.” Trenin and other analysts have suggested Russia is genuinely concerned that Kyiv’s leaders could mistake words of support from the U.S. as backing for an attempt to forcibly take back the occupied regions. Such a view is unsettling, some observers said, suggesting a dangerous disconnect between the Kremlin’s perspective of the conflict and how it is seen by Ukraine and Western countries. “There was no Ukrainian military effort underway that could have justified the operations Russia is now engaged in on Ukraine’s borders,” Gustav Gressel, a senior policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations, wrote in a recent article. “While the Kremlin’s fears are based on illusions, it believes that these illusions entitle it to real offensive actions.”",4,,,,21
2021-04-15,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/us-announces-sweeping-sanctions-russia-cyber-hack-election/story?id=77089976,Biden says he warned Putin he could have gone further on sweeping Russia sanctions,"The United States on Thursday announced a sweeping series of sanctions against Russia over election interference, cyber hacking and other ""harmful foreign activities,"" it said, including reports of Russia offering ""bounties"" for Taliban attacks against U.S. troops, and Russia's occupation and alleged human rights abuses in Crimea. ""I was clear with president Putin that we could have gone further, but I chose not to do so, I chose to be proportionate,"" President Joe Biden said Thursday afternoon from the East Room of the White House. The president walked a fine line during his remarks, attempting to stand firm against Russia for their actions, while also balancing his speech with hopes of diplomacy and keeping an open dialogue between the two countries. ""The United States is not looking to kick off a cycle of escalation and conflict with Russia. We want a stable, predictable relationship,"" he said. The moves marked the first actions the United States has announced it has taken against Russia in reaction to last year's massive cyber hack against U.S. federal agencies, known as the SolarWinds breach, and for the ""bounties"" it had reportedly offered in Afghanistan. The U.S. for the first time formally blamed Russia for the hack, and it also for the first time said its intelligence agencies had determined Russia to be behind the bounties. The White House said the U.S. would expel 10 personnel from Russia's diplomatic mission in Washington, including, ""representatives of Russian intelligence services."" The U.S. also sanctioned ""16 entities and 16 individuals who attempted to influence the 2020 U.S. presidential election at the direction of the leadership of the Russian Government,"" according to the U.S. Treasury Department. They include ""disinformation outlets controlled by Russian intelligence services,"" the Russian ""financier"" and an ""enabler"" of the ""troll farm"" previously sanctioned for 2016 election interference, as well as a ""known Russian agent,"" the administration said. The sanctions, the Treasury Department said, target ""the private and state-owned companies"" that ""enable the Russian Intelligence Services' cyber activities."" In addition, the Treasury Department targeted Russia's sovereign wealth, prohibiting U.S. financial institutions from certain dealings with Russian sovereign debt. The U.S. prohibition on American companies trading Russia's sovereign debt with the country's central bank -- an expansion of previous limits -- caused Russia's currency to slide Thursday. Russia's foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova, in a televised briefing, said U.S. Ambassador John Sullivan had been summoned to Moscow for a ""difficult conversation."" Zakharova also said that a Russian response to the sanctions was ""unavoidable."" ""Such aggressive behavior, without question, will receive a decisive push back, a response to the sanctions is unavoidable,"" she said. ""In Washington, they must realize that it's necessary to pay for the degradation of bilateral relations. Responsibility for what is happening lies entirely on the U.S."" Biden said that during a phone call on Tuesday he ""urged"" Russian President Vladimir Putin ""to respond appropriately, not to exceed it"" and that the U.S. would be ready to ""move as well."" The U.S. also said Thursday that it was sanctioning ""five individuals and three entities related to Russia's occupation of the Crimea region of Ukraine and its severe human rights abuses against the local population."" The sanctions came amid heightened concern about a massive buildup of Russian forces along Ukraine's border and in Crimea, the Ukrainian peninsula that has been occupied by Russia since 2014. Biden described his call with Putin on Tuesday as ""candid"" and ""respectful,"" and also ""strongly urged him to refrain from any military action"" in Ukraine. ""Now is the time to de-escalate,"" he said. ""The way forward is through thoughtful dialogue and diplomatic process."" Biden also said he invoked a conversation earlier this year in which he had warned his Russian counterpart that the United States would ""respond"" if it determined Russia was behind recent cyber intrusions and election interference in the United States. ""When President Putin called me in January -- after I was sworn in -- to congratulate me, I told him that my administration would be looking very carefully now that we had access to all the data and at the issues that -- to assess Russia's role and then determine what response we would make,"" he said. During their call, Biden said he proposed they ""meet in person this summer in Europe"" for a summit, which he said both countries are now discussing. ""Out of that summit -- were it to occur and I believe it will -- the United States and Russia could launch a strategic stability dialogue to pursue cooperation in arms control and security. We can address critical global challenges that require Russia and the United States to work together, including reining in nuclear threats from Iran and North Korea, ending this pandemic globally and meeting the existential crisis of climate change,"" Biden said. Senior Biden administration officials Thursday morning presented the sanctions against Russia as both ""economically impactful"" but also ""proportionate,"" ""tailored"" and ""measured."" ""We have no desire to be in an escalatory cycle with Russia,"" an official told reporters. ""We intend these responses to be proportionate and tailored to the specific past activities, past actions that Russia has taken. We have indicated that we seek a stable and predictable relationship going forward."" Thursday was the first time the U.S. officially attributed the SolarWinds hack to Russia. The breach compromised nine federal government agencies. ""Russian Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) actors (also known as APT29, Cozy Bear, and The Dukes) frequently use publicly known vulnerabilities to conduct widespread scanning and exploitation against vulnerable systems in an effort to obtain authentication credentials to allow further access,"" an advisory from the Federal Bureau of Intelligence, the Department of Homeland Security and National Security Agency said. ""This targeting and exploitation encompasses U.S. and allied networks, including national security and government-related systems."" They said that Russia was still involved in cyber actions against the United States and other allies. The U.S. government, ""critical infrastructure"" and ""allied networks are consistently scanned, targeted, and exploited by Russian state-sponsored cyber actors,"" they said. A senior administration official also said that the U.S. intelligence community had assessed that Russia was behind financial incentives for killing U.S. troops in Afghanistan – one of the impetuses for Thursday's sanctions – although the official noted the assessment was made with ""low-to-moderate confidence"" since it relied on information that detainees had shared and ""the challenging operating environment in Afghanistan."" ""Our conclusion is based on information and evidence of connections between criminal agents in Afghanistan and elements of the Russian government,"" the official said. ""This information puts a burden on the Russian government to explain its actions and take steps to address this disturbing pattern of behavior.""

The call came days after Biden spoke to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky amid heightened concern about a massive buildup of Russian forces along Ukraine's border and in Crimea, the Ukrainian peninsula that has been occupied by Russia since 2014. Ukraine's foreign minister traveled to Brussels for meetings with Biden's Secretary of State Antony Blinken and senior NATO officials Tuesday in a strong signal of support for Kiev against any Russian aggression. During his call with Putin, the White House said, Biden urged him to ""de-escalate tensions"" with Ukraine - and warned the U.S. would ""act firmly"" to defend its own interests after Russia's repeated cyber attacks and election interference. Biden has emphasized a more nuanced approach to Russia than his predecessor, Donald Trump, who sought warmer relations with Putin and was criticized for downplaying Russian aggression, especially its interference in the 2016 presidential election to support him. ""President Biden reaffirmed his goal of building a stable and predictable relationship with Russia consistent with U.S. interests,"" the White House said Tuesday. U.S. officials have previously pointed to the agreement to extend New START, the last nuclear arms control pact between the U.S. and Russia, as an example of how the two countries can find common ground -- and Biden called for ""building on"" that during the call. The Kremlin confirmed interest in that, saying, ""Both sides expressed their readiness to continue the dialogue on the most important areas of ensuring global security... Biden expressed interest in normalizing the state of affairs on the bilateral track and establishing stable and predictable cooperation on such pressing issues,"" like Iran's nuclear program, Afghanistan, and climate change. But Russia's enormous military buildup on Ukraine's borders may make any cooperation anathema in Washington. Russia has massed 41,000 troops at its border with eastern Ukraine and 42,000 more in Crimea, according to a spokesperson for President Zelensky. Russian Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu confirmed Tuesday that the military has deployed two armies and three airborne formations to the region, but said they were participating in military exercises and in response to increased military activity by the U.S. and NATO. In addition to massing forces, Russian-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine have escalated fighting in recent weeks. With renewed shelling and machine-gun fire, 28 Ukrainian soldiers have been killed this year, according to the Ukrainian military -- a sharp increase in the long-running conflict that has killed more than 14,000 people. Beyond the battlefield, Russia has also launched ""a disinformation campaign blatantly designed to falsely blame Ukraine for what are the Kremlin's own actions,"" according to the top U.S. diplomat for Europe, Phil Reeker, who traveled with Blinken to NATO headquarters. The two met Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba Tuesday -- part of a strong signal of Western support for Kiev that included Kuleba meeting with NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg and the NATO-Ukraine Commission as well. While Ukraine isn't a member of the western alliance, it has repeatedly sought to join, with Zelensky saying against last week that it would that a path to membership ""is the only way to end the war in Donbass"" and send a ""real signal for Russia."" Stoltenberg didn't comment on Ukrainian membership, but during a press conference with Kuleba, he called Russia's military buildup ""unjustified, unexplained, and deeply concerning"" and said the alliance would continue to ""provide more practical support to Ukraine, to help them to defend themselves."" In their own meeting, Blinken reiterated that the U.S. ""stands firmly behind the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine,"" while Kuleba called their meeting a ""good symbol"" that helps ""make it very clear for Russia that the price of its aggression against Ukraine will be too heavy for it to bear."" But it's unclear what that price will be. Blinken has warned of ""consequences"" if Russia sends troops or arms into Ukraine, but not provided any details. A senior State Department official said it could include arms sales or sanctions, saying the U.S. has ""to continuously look at what their needs are."" The White House said Biden raised the buildup, but didn't warn of any response: ""The President voiced our concerns over the sudden Russian military build-up in occupied Crimea and on Ukraine's borders, and called on Russia to de-escalate tensions,"" it said in its readout. Instead, Biden's call seemed more focused on U.S.-Russian relations. Early in his administration, the new president ordered the intelligence community to launch a review of Russia's reported role in the SolarWinds hack, the bounties on U.S. troops in Afghanistan, 2020 election interference, and the poisoning of opposition leader Alexei Navalny. While that review remains ongoing, the U.S. joined other allies in sanctioning several Russian officials for Navalny's poisoning and jailing. The White House has said a U.S. response to the SolarWinds hack, which U.S. officials said Russia was responsible for, is coming soon.

The Annual Worldwide Threat Assessment, which provides lawmakers and the American people with a vast landscape of threats to the U.S. homeland, found that the ""far-reaching effects"" of the pandemic, which ""extend well beyond global health to the economic, political, and security spheres,"" may present the governments of Russia, China, Iran and North Korea, an opportunity to ""advance their interests at the expense of the United States and its allies."" ""The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to strain governments and societies, fueling humanitarian and economic crises, political unrest, and geopolitical competition as countries, such as China and Russia, seek advantage through such avenues as 'vaccine diplomacy,'"" the report found. ""No country has been completely spared, and even when a vaccine is widely distributed globally, the economic and political aftershocks will be felt for years."" The 27-page report, released Tuesday, precedes two days of highly anticipated congressional testimony from America’s spy chiefs, who will convene on Capitol Hill this week for the first time in more than two years. Once an annual event, the Worldwide Threat Assessment hearings took a hiatus in 2020 after intelligence community leaders reportedly balked at depicting a national security landscape in conflict with the sentiments conveyed by then-President Donald Trump. Their 2019 testimony, which contradicted Trump’s rosy vision of relations with Iran, attracted scrutiny on the then-president’s now-dormant Twitter page. ""The Intelligence people seem to be extremely passive and naive when it comes to the dangers of Iran. They are wrong!"" Trump tweeted. ""Perhaps Intelligence should go back to school!"" In back-to-back hearings on Wednesday and Thursday, the leaders of the intelligence community -- including Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines and the directors of the CIA, FBI, National Security Agency and Defense Intelligence Agency -- will field questions from lawmakers on the Senate and House intelligence committees about the report’s findings. In addition to the pandemic-related challenges that lie ahead, the intelligence community warned that climate change, an increasingly hostile cyber landscape and ongoing regional conflicts will likely present additional challenges to the U.S. The report also highlighted lingering nuclear threats posed by Iran and North Korea, the continued use of online influence campaigns employed by the Kremlin and Beijing’s ""whole-of-government"" efforts to ""undercut"" the United States’ geopolitical power.",20,,,,17
2021-04-12,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/biden-picks-1st-woman-army-secretary/story?id=77029023,Biden picks 1st woman to be Army secretary,"In a historic nomination, President Joe Biden has nominated Christine Wormuth to serve as the secretary of the Army. If confirmed by the Senate, Wormuth -- who once served as the Pentagon's top policy official in the final years of the Obama administration -- would be the first woman to serve in the position. Also nominated to two other top Pentagon posts were former California Rep. Gil Cisneros to be the under secretary of defense for personnel and readiness, and Susanna Blume to serve as the director of Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation (CAPE). A veteran national security official with previous experience at the Pentagon, Wormuth also served at the director for defense policy at the National Security Council during the Obama administration. Wormuth has most recently worked as the director of the International Security and Defense Policy Center at the Rand Corporation and was an influential player in the Biden transition team at the Pentagon where she headed the Biden-Harris Defense Agency Review Team. ""Christine is a true patriot with a dedicated career in service to America and our nation's security,"" Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said in a statement issued while he is traveling in Berlin. ""As the former Under Secretary of Defense for Policy, Christine advanced the department's counter-ISIS campaign and the rebalance to Asia, and her deep expertise will be critical in addressing and determining today's global threats, including the pacing challenge from China and nation-state threats emanating from Russia, Iran, and North Korea,"" said Austin. ""I have no doubt that, if confirmed, she will lead our soldiers and represent their families with honor and integrity as the Secretary of the Army."" The Biden administration has lagged in naming top officials at several national security agencies, particularly at the Pentagon where career civilians have been working in positions that normally require Senate confirmation. Until Wormuth's nomination this week, none of the civilian heads of the military services had been nominated by the White House. The three Pentagon nominations on Monday were included among almost a dozen national security nominations that included Christy Abizaid to be the next director of the National Counterterrorism Center. ""Defending our nation from enemies foreign and domestic requires a deeply experienced and capable team grounded in a commitment to our nation's ideals and a keen understanding of the sweeping challenges facing our arm forces today,"" said Austin. ""The president's nominations today will help us build that team."" ""Christine Wormuth, Gil Cisneros and Susanna Blume represent decades of combined expertise in national security, and we are positioned to take on the crises we face in the current moment and prepare ourselves for the threats of tomorrow,"" he continued. ""I urge the Senate to confirm them soon, so that they can take up this critical work."" Cisneros was a one-term Democratic congressman who represented California's 39th Congressional District before losing his re-election bid in 2020. During his time in Congress, the 50-year-old Cisneros served on the House Armed Services and Veterans Affairs Committee. After the death of Army Spc. Venessa Guillen, Cisneros participated in discussions on the status of Latinos in the Army and helped introduce the I Am Vanessa Guillén Act that would make sexual harassment a crime within the Uniform Code of Military Justice. He became a philanthropist in 2010 after he won a $266 million Mega Millions jackpot shortly after he had been laid off from a manager's position at Frito-Lay. Prior to her nomination, Blume has already been performing the duties of the director of CAPE. She has held multiple policy and budget positions at the Pentagon and was most recently the Senior Fellow and Director of the Defense Program at the Center for a New American Security (CNAS).",20,,,,27
2021-03-30,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/blinken-swipes-trump-administration-unveiling-human-rights-report/story?id=76770342,Blinken swipes at Trump administration in unveiling human rights report,"Secretary of State Antony Blinken repudiated the Trump administration's approach to human rights, with his most direct condemnation of his predecessor yet. Blinken launched the department's 45th annual human rights report Tuesday -- the gold standard in documenting abuses and atrocities in nearly 200 countries and territories around the world. The report, which covers 2020, found a further deterioration for human rights in many countries, particularly as governments used the coronavirus pandemic to curb their citizens' rights. The first report under the Biden administration also included changes that eliminated the conservative take of the Trump years, like ending former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's ""hierarchy"" of rights and re-introducing a section on women's reproductive rights that will be published later this year. When human rights defenders ""come under attack, they often look to the United States to speak up on their behalf. Too often in recent years, these defenders heard only silence from us,"" Blinken said. ""We are back for those brave advocates as well. We will not be silent."" In particular, Blinken ""decisively"" repudiated Pompeo's ""Unalienable Rights Commission,"" a panel of academics that said in a report last July that freedom of religion and right to property were the most important human rights. While Pompeo touted the report and said it would lay a foundation for future administrations, critics accused it of minimizing minority rights. Blinken essentially jettisoned the report, saying Tuesday, ""There is no hierarchy that makes some rights more important than others. Past unbalanced statements that suggest such a hierarchy, including those offered by a recently disbanded State Department advisory committee, do not represent a guiding document for this administration."" Human rights are increasingly under threat around the world, Blinken said, saying the trendlines ""are in the wrong direction."" In particular, he highlighted what he called the Chinese government's genocide of Uighurs and other Muslim ethnic minorities in Xinjiang province, attacks on civil society and political opposition in Russia, Uganda and Venezuela and on pro-democracy protesters in Belarus, war crimes in Yemen, atrocities ""credibly reported"" in Ethiopia's Tigray region, and abuses by the Syria's Bashar al-Assad's regime. While the report doesn't touch on Myanmar's coup and the military's bloody crackdown on protests, because they happened in 2021, Blinken took time to again condemn the events. But after weeks of steadily increasing U.S. sanctions that have not deterred the ruling junta, he had no specific answer on what else the U.S. could do to change the darkening trajectory there. Blinken also leaned into America's own human rights issues, particularly the moment of racial reckoning in the last year. Chinese officials and state-run outlets have increasingly raised U.S. race relations to say American officials are in no position to criticize Beijing -- comparing Uighur slave labor in Xinjiang to Black slaves in the U.S. South. ""We know we have work to do at home. That includes addressing profound inequities, including systemic racism. We don't pretend these problems don't exist. ... We deal with them in the daylight with full transparency, and in fact, that's exactly what separates our democracy and autocracies,"" he said, adding that open reckoning gives the U.S. ""greater legitimacy"" to address other countries' records, too. The Biden administration will use all tools available to impose consequences on human rights abusers and encourage better behavior, Blinken said, including the new Khashoggi policy that imposes visa restrictions on officials that target or harass their countries' dissidents. ""Standing up for human rights everywhere is in America's interests, and the Biden-Harris administration will stand against human rights abuses wherever they occur, regardless of whether the perpetrators are adversaries or partners,"" he said.",45,,,,3

In fact, the email accounts of top officials at Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency -- the very DHS agency charged with fighting cyber threats -- may have been compromised by the cyberattack, according to one former government official familiar with the matter. In a statement, DHS acknowledges a ""small number"" of employees accounts were targeted in the breach, but there are no indicators that their networks are compromised as of now. ""A widespread intrusion campaign targeted many federal government and private sector entities, including DHS,"" according to a DHS spokesperson. ""Upon learning about the campaign, the Department took immediate steps to respond to the incident, including leveraging response teams from CISA and private sector partners, to continue executing its mission,"" the spokesperson said. ""However, this widespread intrusion campaign has again shown that our strategic adversaries are sophisticated, persistent, and have increasing capabilities.” The massive hack, discovered in December, affected nine federal agencies, according to Deputy National Security Adviser for cyber Anne Neuberger. Those responsible were ""likely of Russian origin,"" that the hack was ""launched from inside the United States” and that it could take ""several months"" to complete the investigation, she said at a press briefing in February. The administration has yet to outline what exactly their response will be to the hack. FBI Director Chris Wray, asked earlier this month by Senate Judiciary Chairman Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., what the U.S. government's response should be to the SolarWinds hack, said he didn't want to answer specifically because ""discussing the response in any detail is probably something that would be better done in a classified setting. That by itself might give you a little bit of a hint."" Wray said more generally that coming back from the SolarWinds hack would be a ""long, hard slog,"" even using the strategy that has been most effective for the U.S. in the past regarding countering cyber adversaries.

The ""Weekly Media Manipulation Snapshot,"" as the document is called, was penned in early February by analysts in the Department of Homeland Security's intelligence branch. It describes an ""overview of sociopolitical topics and narratives amplified by likely Russian, Chinese, and Iranian malign influence actors in state media and proxy websites."" All three governments have long denied interfering in American elections or engaging in cybercrimes targeting the U.S. Yet the bulletin reported that the trio of foreign states is using a mix of online misinformation and favorable news narratives rooted in fact to further polarize American audiences online. Darrell Blocker, a former senior CIA officer, said the strategy of online information warfare reflects a long-standing push to exert influence over Americans. ""Foreign interference in U.S. government affairs has been evasive and expansive for decades, particularly from Russia/Soviet Republics, China and Iran,"" said Blocker, an ABC News contributor. ""The internet, however, has allowed these adversaries to weaponize and tailor their disinformation campaigns against specific audiences and obfuscate their roles like never before."" The wide array of subjects targeted by the Russians, Chinese and Iranians mentioned in the February bulletin -- including the economy, diplomatic spats, health care, and censorship -- indicates that the online information sphere remains a strategic battlefield for America's foes. Russian actors, for example, have focused their online activity on ""election-related issues,"" the report notes, including social media censorship of conservatives, Trump's second impeachment trial, and political polarization in Congress and across the country. The Iranians have targeted ""narratives that further Tehran's foreign policy objectives,"" promoting online commentary such as, ""The United States should be the first to recommit to [nuclear agreement] obligations,"" according to the bulletin. China, said the report, has sought to ""shape U.S. public and leadership perceptions of issues critical to Beijing,"" including dire warnings about a hypothetical ""China-U.S. confrontation"" and issues surrounding Taiwan and Xinjiang. While each of the three actors have prioritized political topics that would seem to bolster their strategic positioning against the U.S. and its allies, Russia, China and Iran also seek to capitalize on misinformation or news narratives surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic and vaccine rollout. Moscow's proxies have promoted articles and commentary that propose that ""U.S. COVID-19 vaccines are ineffective"" and that ""Russia is successfully distributing the Sputnik V vaccine abroad,"" according to the bulletin. For Tehran, an effort has been made to promote content supporting the notion that ""Iranian vaccines such as Razi COV-Pars, are safe and effective against COVID variants."" The bulletin omits any mention of Beijing's interest in manipulating narratives surrounding the vaccine -- but notes their focus on the genesis of the pandemic. The Chinese have promoted narratives about U.S. mismanagement of the pandemic and bolstered the unsubstantiated theory that ""COVID-19 may have crossed national borders to reach the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan."" The broad array of misinformation and narratives being used by foreign adversaries since President Joe Biden's inauguration follows a political season riddled with similar online influence operations. Earlier this month, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence released its highly anticipated report on foreign meddling in the 2020 election, with troubling determinations about the methods used by Russia and Iran to exert their will on voters in November. The report concluded that Russian President Vladimir Putin oversaw sweeping efforts aimed at ""denigrating"" Biden's candidacy, and Iran sought to ""undercut"" then-President Donald Trump's reelection bid. China, the report found, did not seek to interfere in the election -- despite warnings from the Trump administration prior to November's vote that it was China, not Russia, that posed a greater threat.

The report also noted that Iran similarly sought to ""undercut"" then-President Donald Trump’s reelection bid and that China did not seek to interfere in the vote. The intelligence community said it made these assessments with high confidence and insisted that no foreign actors ""attempted to alter any technical aspect of the voting process."" ""Foreign malign influence is an enduring challenge facing our country,"" Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines said in a statement on Tuesday. ""These efforts by U.S. adversaries seek to exacerbate divisions and undermine confidence in our democratic institutions."" The intelligence community’s declassified report, which omits some details that may otherwise expose sensitive sources and methods, reflects the most comprehensive review of the government’s ongoing efforts to combat foreign meddling in U.S. elections. Ahead of the 2020 vote, national security officials in the Trump administration warned that America’s adversaries were waging a widespread influence operation intended to undermine confidence in the democratic process – similar to Russia’s efforts in 2016. Unlike the 2016 election, however, Tuesday’s report noted that Russian actors did not attempt to tamper with election infrastructure. Instead, Moscow employed ""proxies linked to Russian intelligence to push influence narratives-including misleading or unsubstantiated allegations against President Biden-to US media organizations, US officials, and prominent US individuals, including some close to former President Trump and his administration,"" the report said. The intelligence report did not name those close to Trump. Despite warnings from the Trump administration prior to November’s vote that it was China, not Russia, which posed a greater threat, Tuesday’s findings indicate that Beijing ""did not deploy interference efforts and considered but did not deploy influence efforts intended to change the outcome of the US Presidential election."" ""China sought stability in its relationship with the United States, did not view either election outcome as being advantageous enough for China to risk getting caught meddling,"" the report stated. The intelligence community credited ""greater public and media awareness of influence operations in 2020 compared to past election cycles"" with the successful execution of the election. ""Public disclosure of Russian and Iranian efforts and US Government sanctions on some of the responsible actors probably hindered their ability to operate deniably,"" the report concluded.",20,,,,22
2021-02-02,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/senate-confirms-mayorkas-secretary-homeland-security/story?id=75489592,Senate confirms Mayorkas as secretary of homeland security,"The U.S. Senate voted 56-43 to confirm Alejandro Mayorkas, President Joe Biden's pick to lead the Department of Homeland Security. Mayorkas, a former federal prosecutor and deputy DHS secretary, faces an increasing challenge at the border and at home. He takes over a department that hasn't had a confirmed secretary in almost two years. The Biden administration worked quickly to try to roll back former President Donald Trump's immigration policies including the Migrant Protection Protocols program, which keeps individuals seeking asylum into the U.S. in Mexico while they go through the asylum process. The administration also stopped deportations for 100 days. Mayorkas becomes the first latino and first immigrant to lead the Department. According to the International Organization for Migration, thousands of migrants from Honduras -- fleeing violence, devastation caused in the aftermath of two devastating hurricanes and economic hardships due to the COVID-19 pandemic -- were in Guatemala and moving towards Mexico, hoping to ultimately reach the U.S. Something similar occurred in 2019 and immigration authorities at the border were overwhelmed by the influx of migrant families fleeing dangerous conditions in Central America's Northern Triangle: Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador. Depending on how this situation develops, it may turn into one of the earlier immigration issues the Biden administration faces. After his confirmation hearing, Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley opposed fast tracking Mayorkas out of the committee, citing concerns about his immigration policies. The department also faces a national security threat in homegrown domestic extremists -- an issue Mayorkas vowed to combat at his confirmation hearing. ""The threat of domestic extremism is one of the greatest challenges that the Department of Homeland Security confronts,"" Mayorkas said at the hearing, while also calling the Jan. 6 attack at the U.S. Capitol ""horrifying."" Mayorkas is also tasked with helping secure the nation's cyber security after a massive breach by Russia into ""less than 10"" government agencies. ""I can assure you that the cybersecurity of our nation will be one of my highest priorities because I concur with you that the threat is real,"" he said. ""And the threat is every day and we have to do a much better job than we are doing now."" During his Senate confirmation hearing, Mayorkas was also asked about a federal watchdog report from 2015 in which he was accused of improperly meddling with visa applications for wealthy business people. U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services employees cited in the report said the then-deputy homeland security secretary was in touch with applicants outside of normal channels. The Department of Homeland Security Office of Inspector General review, which relies on accounts from more than a dozen Homeland Security employees, found that Mayorkas' actions ""created an appearance of favoritism and special access."" In response, Mayorkas said senators and House members asked for his intervention and he maintained that his involvement was aimed at improving the applications process. ""When a leader enters federal service with the authority to fix problems, that leader has the responsibility to fix problems,"" Mayorkas said. He pointed out his involvement in ""dozens and dozens"" more cases beyond the those mentioned in the report. The inspector general was tasked with reviewing just three of the thousands of high-profile visas issued each year and did not conclude that anything improper occurred in the handling of the applications.

The report, issued by the Department of Homeland Security's Cyber Mission and Counterintelligence Mission centers in mid-January, warns that based on previous cyberattacks targeting political campaigns between 2018-2020, foreign cyber actors -- specifically American adversaries like Russia -- are ""very likely"" to target transition officials' ""government transition e-mail accounts and associated personal e-mail accounts."" Among the concerns detailed in the report is the risk that nation-state hackers sanctioned by foreign governments will likely look to take advantage of transition officials ""conducting a significant portion of the transition remotely rather than in face-to-face interactions as a result of COVID-19 restrictions."" The remote environment, the reports says, makes officials more ""attractive cyber targets for collection and possibly influence operations"" during the sensitive transition period. While there’s a heightened risk of cyberattacks when working remotely, this report focused on the transition period and details several tactics attackers could employ to compromise transition officials' virtual private networks and other remote work tools in order to ""gain initial access or persistence on a victim's network,"" including targeting official or personal e-mail accounts, posing as trusted associates, and ""spoofing domains to increase the appearance that the e-mails are legitimate."" ""Beyond serving traditional espionage purposes, these cyber activities could be used by foreign adversaries to enable influence operations, such as the leaking of sensitive or personal information designed to embarrass individuals and organizations -- or affect others' perceptions of those targets -- based on our analysis of prior cyber operations against U.S. Government officials and associated individuals,"" the intelligence notice says. The White House and DHS did not respond to requests for comment. Elizabeth Neumann, a former assistant secretary of Homeland Security during the Trump administration, told ABC News that while espionage efforts during the transition period have become standard, including during the 2016-2017 transition period, ""Operating in a near-virtual environment due to the pandemic creates more vulnerabilities, upon which advanced persistent threat actors may be able to capitalize."" ""Basic cyber hygiene and end-user best practices will mitigate many of the attempts these actors undertake,"" Neumann said. The report also cited the massive SolarWinds hack, which targeted U.S. government agencies and private corporations and left 18,000 networks compromised. The document noted that the federal Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency ""has observed malicious actors using the compromise to access resources in hosted environments, such as email for data exfiltration."" Earlier in January, top national security agencies formally named Russia as the likely source of the SolarWinds hack, with former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo calling the hack ""a very significant effort"" and ""pretty clearly"" the work of Russians.

2021-01-19,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/bidens-dni-pick-vows-investigate-foreign-role-capitol/story?id=75343022,"Biden's DNI pick vows to help investigate any foreign role in Capitol siege, warns of China's rise","President-elect Joe Biden's choice to lead the U.S. intelligence community vowed Tuesday to help the FBI uncover any role that foreign nations like Russia may have played in radicalizing the violent mob that stormed the U.S. Capitol two weeks ago, even as she assured lawmakers that politics would have no place in her office. ""I've certainly seen Russia's use of active measures and a variety of influence campaigns to exacerbate some of the divisions in this country and to promote extremism,"" Avril Haines, the nominee to become director of national intelligence who served as a senior national security adviser in the Obama administration, told the Senate Intelligence Committee during her confirmation hearing on Tuesday. Haines was pressed over concerns that the DNI's office had at times become too political, with the committee's top Democrat and soon-to-be chairman, Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., saying that most recently the U.S. intelligence community had been ""unfairly maligned"" and questioned by President Donald Trump. Haines said any effective DNI ""must never shy away from speaking truth to power -- even, especially, when doing so may be inconvenient or difficult."" ""To safeguard the integrity of our intelligence community, the DNI must insist that, when it comes to intelligence, there is simply no place for politics -- ever,"" she added. Politics, though, drove the violent Trump supporters who attacked the Capitol and assaulted law enforcement officers on Jan 6. They were motivated by unfounded claims -- made by Trump himself -- that the 2020 presidential election was illegitimate and stolen from him. Haines said that, if confirmed, she hopes the U.S. intelligence community can play ""an important role"" in supporting investigations by the FBI and Department of Homeland Security into whether any foreign actors may have helped inject those unfounded claims into the American bloodstream, and whether there may be any other ""connections"" between those who participated in the siege and individuals abroad. Warner said the Capitol had been overrun by ""insurrections [from] a whole series of violent right-wing extremist groups -- Proud Boys, Oath Keepers, Three Percenters, other so-called militia groups."" But Warner noted such right-ring extremism is ""not a problem that is unique to America,"" saying, ""We've seen similar right-wing groups spring up across many European nations, and some level of networking between what's happening in Europe and what's happening in this country."" In fact, the FBI has identified several cases of white supremacists in America who have been in contact with like-minded extremists overseas, with some of the Americans even traveling to Europe to train with right-wing radicals there. ""This is a major issue for the country,"" Haines said of domestic terrorism coming from the fringes of the right and left. Both Republican and Democratic senators on the committee expressed concern over what the committee's outgoing chairman, Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Florida, called ""the challenge"" of preventing foreign countries from trying ""to get us to fight with each other."" ""Not that we don't do a pretty good job of it on our own,"" Rubio quipped. Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, said he wants the FBI to brief the committee on what it's found so far about foreign influence in the Jan. 6 siege, which left five Americans dead, including a U.S. Capitol Police officer. In an intelligence assessment issued last week, several federal law enforcement agencies noted that since the Capitol assault, ""Russian, Iranian, and Chinese influence actors have seized the opportunity to amplify narratives in furtherance of their policy interest."" In at least one instance, a ""Russian proxy"" claimed that members of the radical left-wing group antifa had ""disguised themselves as supporters of President Trump, and were responsible for storming the Capitol building,"" the intelligence assessment said. Similarly, ""Iranian state media has continued to stoke claims that President Trump encouraged and incited the violence,"" while Chinese media ""have seized the story to denigrate US democratic governance—casting the United States as broadly in decline,"" according to the intelligence assessment. Haines and the lawmakers on the committee agreed that China poses one of the greatest overall threats to U.S. national security, with Haines describing China as an ""adversary"" when it comes to espionage and protecting America's secrets. Warner said government officials and the public need to be ""clear-eyed about China."" ""Perhaps the greatest challenge facing you as DNI will be a rising China that is committed to surpassing and eclipsing the U.S. militarily, economically, and technologically,"" Warner told Haines during Tuesday's hearing. With the array of threats to U.S. interests emanating from around the world, ""You'll not have an easy job,"" Warner warned Haines. Still, Haines said the fact that she could sit before the lawmakers after the events of the past two weeks was ""truly remarkable."" ""I just want to say how eerie it was even coming here today to see how, uh, to see the National Guard out across Washington and in these halls,"" she said, referring to massive security measures put in place ahead of Wednesday's inauguration. ""And my first reaction in watching the events was really concern and obviously empathy for all of you ... and how truly disturbing it was to see what was done to these sacred halls, frankly, and sort of the heart of our democracy."" But, she told the lawmakers, she was ""proud to be part of a country where I saw all of you not let it affect your work, not let you miss a beat, and come back in and do the work of the American people."" For the last two years of President Barack Obama's presidency, Haines, 51, served as the White House's deputy national security adviser. Before that, she served as the CIA's deputy director and in other senior national security roles.",20,,,,16

""This work indicates that an Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) actor, likely Russian in origin, is responsible for most or all of the recently discovered, ongoing cyber compromises of both government and non-governmental networks,"" the FBI, Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Administration, and Office of Director of National Intelligence said in a joint statement. ""At this time, we believe this was, and continues to be, an intelligence gathering effort. We are taking all necessary steps to understand the full scope of this campaign and respond accordingly."" The intrusion involves software from SolarWinds, which makes IT management tools, that had been adulterated, or ""Trojanized,"" with a vulnerability that could be exploited by hackers to steal information, manipulate systems or plant trap doors and other exploits for future use. The statement said that under 10 government agencies have been impacted. ABC News has reported five that were breached: the State Department, Energy Department, Department of Homeland Security, Treasury Department and Commerce Department. ""We have so far identified fewer than ten U.S. government agencies that fall into this category, and are working to identify and notify the nongovernment entities who also may be impacted,"" the statement added. The agencies also say this is a ""serious compromise that will require a sustained and dedicated effort to remediate."" The statement contradicted what President Donald Trump tweeted about the cyberattack in December. He baselessly accused China and brought up the general election being compromised despite no evidence to support it. ""The Cyber Hack is far greater in the Fake News Media than in actuality. I have been fully briefed and everything is well under control. Russia, Russia, Russia is the priority chant when anything happens because Lamestream is, for mostly financial reasons, petrified of discussing the possibility that it may be China (it may!). There could also have been a hit on our ridiculous voting machines during the election, which is now obvious that I won big, making it an even more corrupted embarrassment for the USA,"" he said. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and former Attorney General William Barr attributed the hack to Russia last month. ""It appears to be the Russians,"" Barr said at a press conference, adding that he couldn't comment any further. ABC News' Conor Finnegan contributed to this report.",20,,,,5

President Donald Trump has been briefed about the uncorroborated intelligence, the official said. Axios first reported on the intelligence on Wednesday. A spokesperson for China's foreign ministry, Wang Wenbin, on Thursday denied the accusation, calling it a ""smear and slander against China"" that was ""completely nonsense"" and ""fake news."" The declassification comes as the Trump administration attempts to maintain pressure on China during the president's final few weeks in office. U.S. national security adviser Robert O'Brien verbally briefed the president about the intelligence, which was also included in a briefing for Trump on Dec. 17, according to the official. The official said different U.S. government agencies were working to corroborate the initial intelligence. The administration has taken a strikingly different approach to this uncorroborated intelligence, declassifying it and confirming it was working to confirm it, compared with the White House's strong pushback when The New York Times reported over the summer that Trump had been briefed on an intelligence assessment that Russia had been doing the same -- offering bounties on U.S. troops in Afghanistan. At the time, Trump dismissed the report as a ""hoax,"" and the White House press secretary, Kayleigh McEnany, criticized the Times and downplayed the underlying intelligence as unverified. Instead of now pushing back, as it did in the case of the report about Russia, the administration is using the intelligence to more publicly go after China, which Trump has portrayed as a greater foe than Russia.",20,,,,16
2020-12-20,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/top-intelligence-democrat-accuses-russia-cyber-hack-resulted/story?id=74820951,Top Intelligence Democrat accuses Russia of cyber hack that resulted in 'big haul',"As United States officials continue to assess the impact of a widespread cyber hack of several federal agencies and large private companies, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee agreed Sunday with the consensus view that Russia was responsible for the attack, and took aim at President Trump for downplaying that assessment. ""All indications point to Russia,"" Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., the vice chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee told ABC Chief Anchor George Stephanopoulos on ""This Week,"" agreeing with recent claims by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and his Republican Intelligence Committee counterpart, Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla. Warner went on to state that Russia ""came away with a big, big haul,"" but that the government is still analyzing the extent of the attack, saying it will take ""literally weeks to continue to ferret this out and then potentially months to remediate."" Last week, it was revealed that several U.S. government departments, including Homeland Security, State and Treasury, among others, were the victims of a monthslong cyberattack that began with a breach of software contractor SolarWinds. The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency described the intrusion as a ""grave risk to the Federal Government … as well as critical infrastructure entities and other private sector organizations."" Despite that characterization and expressions of concern from members of Congress, including many Republicans, Trump downplayed the breach in a tweet Saturday, claiming the media is exaggerating the impact and that ""everything is well under control."" The president additionally cast doubt upon Russia's responsibility for the hack one day after Pompeo stated otherwise, writing that the media is ""petrified of discussing the possibility that it may be China (it may!)."" The secretary told conservative radio host Mark Levin Friday that ""we can say pretty clearly that it was the Russians that engaged in this activity."" ""When the president of the United States either tries to deflect, or is not willing to call out the adversary as we make this attribution, he is not making our country safer,"" Warner said Sunday. On ""This Week,"" the senator allowed for the possibility that, despite the discovery of the breach, ""it may be ongoing."" He added that SolarWinds' extensive list of customers across the government allowed for the attackers to work down its ""supply chain"" and ""ultimately get down to some of our most important innovation tools,"" describing the implications as ""extraordinarily serious."" For now, Warner said ""there's no indication yet [that] classified networks have been breached,"" but noted that ""critical information"" and potentially intellectual property related to cyber defense systems had been stolen from FireEye, the cybersecurity firm that first called attention to the intrusion. To that point, Stephanopoulos challenged Warner on the U.S.' own international cyber activities, noting that the country engages in similar efforts. ""How do you respond to those who say this is exactly the kind of thing America does all the time?"" Stephanopoulos asked. ""We attack and we conduct espionage on foreign governments and foreign systems."" The senator characterized Russia's alleged actions as ""indiscriminate"" in his answer, appearing to indicate that the hack was more extensive than the U.S.' activities. ""This is as broad and as deep as anything we've ever seen,"" Warner said, adding, ""the idea that that should go unanswered would be very bad American policy"" and could ""invite Russians, or others to continue these kinds of malicious activities."" As for the federal government's next steps, Warner argued that it needs to evaluate its cyber regulations and potentially implement rules that require private companies to report attacks and intrusions. He further likened the country's digital defense to the military, suggesting priorities shift in the modern age. ""I sometimes think we disproportionately spend on tanks, ships and guns, when we should be better protecting on cyber,"" the senator said.",20,,,,5
2020-12-19,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/pretty-clear-russia-solarwinds-hack-pompeo-1st-us/story?id=74818788,"'Pretty clear' Russia behind SolarWinds hack, Pompeo says, becoming 1st US official to blame Moscow","Donald Trump ran for the presidency promising to repair relations with Russia, saying repeatedly on the campaign trail in 2016 that it would be ""great"" if the U.S. and Russia ""got along."" But as his administration winds down, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is publicly blaming Moscow for a massive cyberattack that has affected several government agencies, including the most sensitive ones that oversee the nuclear weapons stockpile and COVID-19 vaccine research. Less than 24 hours later, Trump contradicted that with his first comments on the SolarWinds hack, tweeting that it was exaggerated by the media and that China could be responsible. It fits a familiar pattern of the last four years -- senior Trump officials trying to be tough on Moscow, while Trump downplays the threat. Amid the ongoing hack, Pompeo is also closing the last two U.S. consulates in Russia, citing the caps on American personnel that Moscow has forced on the U.S. mission in recent years. Once welcomed by Trump, those caps, which have hamstrung U.S. diplomats, were Russian retaliation against U.S. sanctions for its aggression online, in neighboring Ukraine, and with chemical weapons. ""This was a very significant effort, and I think it's the case that now we can say pretty clearly that it was the Russians that engaged in this activity,"" Pompeo told conservative radio host Mark Levin late Friday, hours before Trump's tweet. But Pompeo also indicated that the administration is not planning to take any action against Vladimir Putin's government, at least not publicly: ""There are many things that you'd very much love to say, 'Boy, I'm going to call that out,' but a wiser course of action to protect the American people is to calmly go about your business and defend freedom."" The SolarWinds hack is a ""significant and ongoing cybersecurity campaign,"" according to the FBI, the Department of Homeland Security and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. The intrusion involves software from SolarWinds, which makes IT management tools, that had been ""Trojanized"" with a vulnerability that could be exploited by hackers to steal information, manipulate systems or plant trap doors and other exploits for future use. Russia has denied responsibility for the hack. So far, the Departments of State, Homeland Security, Commerce, and Energy, as well as the National Institutes of Health all have reportedly been affected. ""The magnitude of this ongoing attack is hard to overstate,"" Trump's former homeland security adviser Thomas Bossert wrote this week. ""If it is Russia, President Trump must make it clear to Vladimir Putin that these actions are unacceptable. The U.S. military and intelligence community must be placed on increased alert; all elements of national power must be placed on the table."" After days of silence, Trump claimed on Saturday that the media is exaggerating the security breach's impact. He said he has ""been fully briefed and everything is well under control."" He went on to tweet that China may be behind the attack instead of Russia and claimed that there ""could also have been a hit on our ridiculous voting machines during the election."" While no public response seems to be coming soon, the U.S. is being forced to take another step that will cut into relations with Russia -- closing its last two consulates in the country. A State Department spokesperson confirmed to ABC News Friday that Pompeo, in consultation with U.S. ambassador to Russia, John Sullivan, decided to permanently close the U.S. consulate in Vladivostok and temporarily close the one in Yekaterinburg. This leaves just the U.S. embassy in Moscow as the only U.S. mission in the country. Russia forced the U.S. to close its consulate in St. Petersburg in 2018 in retaliation for the U.S. shuttering its facility in Seattle because of the poisoning of former spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in the United Kingdom. The U.S. facility in Vladivostok, Russia's major Pacific port near the border with North Korea, had been closed since March because of COVID-19 when most of its staff evacuated. The consulate in Yekaterinburg, Russia's fourth-largest city, was the only U.S. mission for the center of Russia. The spokesperson said in a statement that the decision was ""part of our ongoing efforts to ensure the safe and secure operation of the U.S. diplomatic mission in the Russian Federation"" and ""was taken to optimize the work of the U.S. mission."" But in a private notice to Congress, sent last week and first obtained by The Associated Press Friday evening, the department said it was a ""response to the ongoing staffing challenges of the U.S. Mission in Russia in the wake of the 2017-imposed personnel cap on the U.S. Mission and resultant impasse with Russia over diplomatic visas."" Russia imposed caps on the U.S. presence in 2017 in retaliation to sanctions placed by the Obama administration over the 2016 election interference --- a move that has hamstrung U.S. diplomats, but which President Trump said he was ""very thankful"" for though the White House later said he was being ""sarcastic."" That low point in U.S.-Russian relations is rivaled by the current one, with Russia believed to be responsible for the massive SolarWinds hack, which has also affected the private sector. Pompeo is the first U.S. official to go on the record and blame the Russian government, after U.S. officials told ABC News and other outlets that Moscow was likely responsible. ""We're still unpacking precisely what it is, and I'm sure some of it will remain classified. But suffice it to say there was a significant effort to use a piece of third-party software to essentially embed code inside of U.S. government systems and it now appears systems of private companies and companies and governments across the world as well,"" Pompeo also told Levin. But the U.S. doesn't expect to take action against Russia's remaining diplomatic facilities here, the State Department spokesperson said. Russia still has consulates in Houston and New York, as well as its Washington embassy. ABC News' Elizabeth Thomas, Luke Barr and Jack Date contributed to this report.",20,,,,5

The FBI, meanwhile, said it is 'investigating and gathering intelligence"" on the breach, according to a statement released Wednesday night, but officials have said little else, and President Donald Trump has yet to comment on the attack, which officials have told ABC News is believed linked to Russia. President-elect Joe Biden issued a statement Thursday calling it a ""matter of great concern."" “I have instructed my team to learn as much as we can about this breach, and Vice President-elect Harris and I are grateful to the career public servants who have briefed our team on their findings, and who are working around-the-clock to respond to this attack,” Biden said. “We will elevate cybersecurity as an imperative across the government, further strengthen partnerships with the private sector, and expand our investment in the infrastructure and people we need to defend against malicious cyberattacks. But a good defense isn’t enough; we need to disrupt and deter our adversaries from undertaking significant cyber attacks in the first place,” Biden said, noting his team would implement stronger punitive measures for those who carry out any such attacks on the U.S. “Our adversaries should know that, as President, I will not stand idly by in the face of cyber assaults on our nation,” Biden said. The intrusion involves software from SolarWinds, which makes IT management tools, that had been adulterated or “Trojanized” with a vulnerability that could be exploited by hackers to steal information, manipulate systems or plant trap doors and other exploits for future use. The FBI, Department of Homeland Security and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence called the intrusion a ""significant and ongoing cybersecurity campaign."" ""The FBI is investigating and gathering intelligence in order to attribute, pursue, and disrupt the responsible threat actors,"" the agency's statement said. “The FBI is engaging with known and suspected victims, and information gained through FBI’s efforts will provide indicators to network defenders and intelligence to our government partners to enable further action.” The three agencies established a Cyber Unified Coordination Group on Tuesday and will work ""to coordinate a whole-of-government response to this significant cyber incident."" The statement reiterated that the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), under the Department of Homeland Security, is the lead agency in helping secure companies and agencies affected. Two government officials told ABC News that Russia is believed to be behind the attack that has so far compromised the Department of Homeland Security, State Department, National Institute of Health, Commerce and Treasury Departments. National Security Adviser Robert O’Brien cut an international trip short in order to return to the United States to address the cyberbreach of U.S. government computer networks, according to the White House’s National Security Council. A person familiar with the matter confirmed that there has been at least one NSC meeting to discuss the situation. The Russians have denied they are behind the attack, and while Trump hasn't commented, White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany asked on Tuesday about the breaches said the U.S. government was “taking all necessary steps to identify and remedy any possible issues related to the situation.” One lawmaker briefed on the intrusion said what they saw was troubling. ""Stunning,"" Sen. Richard Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat, tweeted on Tuesday. ""Today’s classified briefing on Russia’s cyberattack left me deeply alarmed, in fact downright scared. Americans deserve to know what's going on. Declassify what’s known & unknown."" Others, like former Trump administration Homeland Security Adviser Tom Bossert said ""the magnitude of the attack cannot be overstated."" ""The logical conclusion is that we must act as if the Russian government has control of all the networks it has penetrated. But it is unclear what the Russians intend to do next,"" Bossert wrote in New York Times op-ed. ""The access the Russians now enjoy could be used for far more than simply spying."" Bossert also asserts that trying to pick up the pieces after this intrusion could be very difficult. ""The remediation effort alone will be staggering. It will require the segregated replacement of entire enclaves of computers, network hardware and servers across vast federal and corporate networks,"" Bossert said. ""Somehow, the nation’s sensitive networks have to remain operational despite unknown levels of Russian access and control. A “do over” is mandatory and entire new networks need to be built — and isolated from compromised networks. Cyber threat hunters that are stealthier than the Russians must be unleashed on these networks to look for the hidden, persistent access controls. These information security professionals actively search for, isolate and remove advanced, malicious code that evades automated safeguards. This will be difficult work as the Russians will be watching every move on the inside,"" he warned. Cyberexperts concur with Bossert’s assertion that this hack could potentially be incredibly damaging. “The potential for damage here is full compromise of the environment, including theft of sensitive materials,” Tony Turner, Vice President for Security Solutions for Fortress Security Solutions, told ABC News. On Monday, SolarWinds said as many as 18,000 organizations including unclassified federal government networks and 425 Fortune 500 companies could have downloaded the malicious software, according to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing. ""We believe that this vulnerability is the result of a highly-sophisticated, targeted and manual supply chain attack by a nation state. We are acting in close coordination with FireEye, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the intelligence community, and other law enforcement to investigate these matters,"" SolarWinds President and CEO Kevin Thompson said on Sunday. Over the weekend, CISA, assessed there is “high potential for compromises of agency information systems,” and the potential “grave impact of a successful compromise,” in affected systems and for only the fifth time in the agency’s history issued an emergency directive “to review their networks for indicators of compromise and disconnect or power down SolarWinds Orion products immediately.” CISA is operating with an acting director after President Trump fired director Chris Krebs in November. ""The compromise of SolarWinds’ Orion Network Management Products poses unacceptable risks to the security of federal networks,"" said CISA acting Director Brandon Wales. Javed Ali, a former senior counterterrorism director on the National Security Council and former FBI official said that Russia has not been deterred by the United States previous response to Russians meddling in US systems. ""It raises serious questions about the level of US defensive measures against cyber-attacks, as the vulnerabilities exploited in this latest attack crossed over into both private industry cyber tools and federal ones--neither of which were able to identify the Russian breaches until months after they began,"" he explained.

We have asked CISA and the FBI to investigate, and we cannot comment further at this time,” the Commerce Department said in a statement Sunday. A source familiar with the investigation tells ABC News it was a sophisticated attack and that very few entities are capable of such. Authorities are investigating and assessing who was behind the breach, which may reach beyond the Treasury and Commerce departments, but two government officials tell ABC News that Russia is believed to be behind the cyber intrusion. “The United States government is aware of these reports and we are taking all necessary steps to identify and remedy any possible issues related to this situation,” NSC spokesman John Ullyot told ABC News. The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, an arm of the Department of Homeland Security, told ABC News it is assisting with the investigation. “We have been working closely with our agency partners regarding recently discovered activity on government networks. CISA is providing technical assistance to affected entities as they work to identify and mitigate any potential compromises.” CISA offered an emergency directive Sunday night to “mitigate the compromise” of the software that is used by the Treasury and Commerce Departments and was compromised. SolarWinds, the company which provided the software for these agencies, says it's working with the FBI and law enforcement to get to the bottom of the breach. ""We are aware of a potential vulnerability which, if present, is currently believed to be related to updates which were released between March and June 2020 to our Orion monitoring products,"" SolarWinds President and CEO Kevin Thompson said in a statement. ""We believe that this vulnerability is the result of a highly-sophisticated, targeted and manual supply chain attack by a nation state."" Under the Homeland Security Act, CISA can authorize emergency guidance to federal departments using the software to disconnect the software from their server. “The compromise of SolarWinds’ Orion Network Management Products poses unacceptable risks to the security of federal networks,” CISA Acting Director Brandon Wales said in a statement Sunday. “Tonight’s directive is intended to mitigate potential compromises within federal civilian networks, and we urge all our partners—in the public and private sectors—to assess their exposure to this compromise and to secure their networks against any exploitation.”",20,,,,5
2020-12-11,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/dhs-whistleblower-testifies-house-intelligence-committee/story?id=74675983,DHS whistleblower testifies before House Intelligence Committee,"A former senior Department of Homeland Security intelligence official who accused agency leaders of downplaying the threat of Russian election interference and white supremacist groups, appeared on Capitol Hill Friday to testify to lawmakers behind closed doors. Brian Murphy, the former chief of the DHS intelligence agency, filed a 24-page whistleblower complaint over the summer accusing DHS leadership -- including former Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen and Acting Secretary Chad Wolf -- of trying to ""censor"" and ""manipulate"" intelligence for political purposes, in the months ahead of the presidential election. Murphy claimed that he was instructed by Wolf ""to cease providing intelligence assessments on the threat of Russian interference in the United States, and instead start reporting on interference activities by China and Iran."" The request, according to Murphy's complaint, originated with White House National Security Adviser Robert O'Brien. He also said he was told to align intelligence assessments with President Trump's public comments about the threat of left-wing extremists, amid national protests over police brutality and racial inequality following the death of George Floyd. Murphy was initially asked to testify before the House Intelligence Committee in September, but the session was stalled over a dispute about Murphy and his legal team's access to classified information relevant to his complaint. He was scheduled to appear before the committee for a staff-led interview Friday morning. Reassigned from his role at the DHS intelligence agency in August, Murphy still works at the department. A Department of Homeland Security spokesperson did not respond to a message from ABC News seeking comment, but the agency ""flatly"" denied Murphy's claims as outlined in the whistleblower complaint.",20,,,,24
2020-12-10,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/pentagon-plans-cut-support-cias-counterterrorism-missions/story?id=74641591,Pentagon weighs cutting most of its support to CIA's counterterrorism missions,"In a surprising move, the Pentagon has told the Central Intelligence Agency that it is weighing an end to the majority of the military support it provides to the agency's counterterrorism missions, according to a former senior administration intelligence official. It is unclear how the decision would impact the spy agency's worldwide counterterrorism missions that often rely on the U.S. military for logistical support and personnel. Acting Defense Secretary Christopher Miller sent a letter to CIA Director Gina Haspel outlining the possible decision, according to the former official, who characterized the action as both surprising and unprecedented. Miller’s letter asked that the CIA provide a response by Jan. 5, according to a DOD official. The CIA's Special Activities Center carries out covert operations and has its own paramilitary force that carries out counterterrorism operations. While they act as an independent force, they often rely on the military for transportation and logistical support. Sometimes that means that military personnel end up being detailed to support the CIA's counterterrorism operations. Defense One was first to report that the Pentagon was reviewing its support to the CIA. The online defense news outlet cited multiple officials as saying the intent behind the move is to see if Defense Department personnel ""detailed"" to the CIA should be diverted from counterterrorism missions and toward missions related to competition with Russia and China. A Defense Department spokesman indicated that the possible shift away from supporting the CIA's counterterrorism missions was in line with the National Defense Strategy that pushes the military's focus away from the regional wars in the Middle East towards near-peer competitors like Russia and China. ""As a responsible actor, the department has taken a look to better align its allocation of resources with the 2018 National Defense Strategy's shift to great power competition,"" said Lt. Col. Uriah Orland, a Defense Department spokesperson. ""Much has changed in the first two decades of this century, and DOD simply is working with CIA to ensure that both DOD and CIA are able to jointly confront the national security challenges facing the United States consistent with the NDS,"" he added. ""DOD also believes that discussions with our partners should proceed quickly."" ""There is no stronger relationship nor better partnership than that between CIA and DOD,"" said Nicole de Haay, a CIA spokesperson. ""That partnership has led to accomplishments that significantly advanced U.S. national security, and we are confident that DOD and CIA will continue this close collaboration for years to come."" ""If these stories are true, they mark a serious setback to a very strong and effective relationship between the CIA and the Defense Department,"" said Mick Mulroy, a former deputy assistant secretary of defense, retired CIA paramilitary officer and ABC News contributor. ""A relationship that has resulted in countless successes in the last 20 years, especially in the area of counterterrorism such as the bin Laden and al-Baghdadi operations, but also in many that will remain unknown."" ""This could increase the risk to CIA officers until it can be readdressed by the incoming administration,"" he added. ""If it is not reversed, the CIA needs to be increased in personnel and funding to make up for the difference to continue their critical missions."" Last week, a CIA paramilitary officer was killed in Somalia, according to Gen. Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who disclosed in remarks to a think tank that the deceased CIA officer had previously served in the military as a Navy SEAL. The Pentagon announced last week that President Donald Trump had ordered the withdrawal of most of the 700 U.S. military personnel in Somalia, though it said it would continue to carry out counterterrorism missions against al-Shabab, the al-Qaida affiliate. Presumably, the removal of most of those troops would already have had an impact on the CIA's counterterrorism operations in that country. ""Pulling DOD detailees from the CIA can only be motivated for political reasons,"" said Eric Oehlerich, a former Navy SEAL and ABC News contributor, who noted that the relationship between both organizations has grown exponentially over the last two decades not only in high-profile missions, but daily operations that go unnoticed. ""The relationships on the ground and within the ranks is on solid ground,"" said Oehlerich. ""Pulling this support is akin to cutting off your nose to spite your face. "" A former high-ranking CIA official described the Pentagon's plans as ""highly irregular"" given that the CIA's counter-terrorism missions can no longer be executed by the CIA without U.S. military support. ""The pushback or slow rolling of this initiative by the Defense Department and the CIA likely renders this moot, but the damage from this shot across the bow has been done,"" said Darrell Blocker, a former deputy director of the CIA's Counterterrorism Center and an ABC News contributor. Editor’s Note: This article has been updated to reflect that Jan. 5 was the date given by the DOD as a deadline for the CIA to provide a response to Miller’s letter and not the date by which DOD would cut off most of its support to the CIA’s counterterrorism missions.",20,,,,27

Russia successfully compromised network infrastructure in some government agencies, according to government officials. U.S. officials told ABC News that systems containing election-related information from two counties in two separate states were successfully hacked by the Russian effort. A new Homeland Security Alert states, ""As this recent malicious activity has been directed at [state, local, territorial and tribal (SLTT)] government networks, there may be some risk to elections information housed on (those) government networks."" While the FBI and Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency have seen no evidence that data has been altered, FBI and Homeland Security officials expressed concern that Russia ""may be seeking access to obtain future disruption options, to influence U.S. policies and actions, or to delegitimize SLTT government entities."" Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe announced Wednesday that Russia and Iran had ""taken specific actions to influence public opinion relating to our elections,"" and that voter registration information had been obtained by both countries. Ratcliffe made the announcement during an unusual evening announcement at FBI headquarters, alongside FBI Director Christopher Wray, Assistant Attorney General for National Security John Demers and CISA Director Christopher Krebs. The FBI and CISA said in an alert that there is no evidence to date to suggest that the Russians have ""intentionally disrupted any aviation, education, elections or government operations or that integrity of elections data has been compromised."" Separately, sources say that Iran is also engaging in efforts to penetrate elections-related systems. According to a DHS bulletin about Iranian activities, ""Actors are creating fictitious media sites and spoofing legitimate media sites to spread obtained U.S. voter-registration data, anti-American propaganda, and misinformation about voter suppression, voter fraud, and ballot fraud."" Though Ratcliffe focused on Iran's efforts to send spoofed emails designed to intimidated voters in the U.S., officials maintain that Russia remains a more potent threat, using a range of efforts to undermine confidence in the democratic process. The Kremlin denied it is meddling in the U.S. election following the new allegations from the DNI on Wednesday. ""We can comment on it with regret. Such accusations pour in every day. They are absolutely unsubstantiated and groundless. Rather, it's some kind of tribute to the domestic political processes linked to the approaching elections,"" the Kremlin's spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, told reporters in his daily conference call Thursday. Wray, during the Wednesday announcement, encouraged Americans to ""seek election and voting information from reliable sources, namely your state election officials, and to be thoughtful, careful and discerning consumers of information online."" Federal and state officials remain confident that voting systems are secure.",20,,,,22
2020-10-23,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/pelosi-urges-caution-statements-coming-election-intelligence-community/story?id=73766002,Pelosi urges caution about 'any statements coming out about the election from the intelligence community',"Although Democrats have accepted the new revelation from the intelligence community that both Russia and Iran have obtained voter data in their efforts to interfere in the election, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Thursday urged caution on statements coming from the intelligence community less than two weeks from Election Day. Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe and FBI Director Christopher Wray held a surprise press conference Wednesday night to announce the foreign interference, including news of threatening emails purporting to be from the alt-right group the Proud Boys, who have denied any involvement. ""I think we have to be very careful about any statements coming out about the election from the intelligence community at this time,"" Pelosi said. House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff said that he doesn't question the actions, but is wary of some who get information from overseas. ""I don't have any reason to question that Iran is involved in the two actions identified by the intelligence community and that Russia continues through a variety of platforms to seek to interfere in this election through cutouts, through the laundering of information, through willing members of Congress, through overt media and covert media. It's definitely a situation of voters beware,"" Schiff told MSNBC on Thursday. David Cicilline, D-R.I., a member of the House Judiciary Committee, told ABC News he has great confidence in the director of the FBI. ""I have less confidence in the director of national intelligence, who made it clear that he believes he serves the interests of the president,"" Cicilline, who is running for assistant speaker of the House, said. ""I don't think there's any question that foreign adversaries, principally Russia and now some activity by the Iranians, is underway to try to corrupt the American presidential election. I don't think there's any question about that."" But not all Democrats agree. Sen. Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Intelligence Committee, who has been briefed twice on the recent attacks, told reporters, ""I understand Director Ratcliffe made the comments he made,"" adding that he thought ""it was appropriate that the leadership of the community came forward and raised this issue about Iran."" ""I think it's a legitimate issue, but I think it's also important that they continue to point out the ongoing threats they face from Russia as well,"" Warner added. Warner, like Pelosi and Schiff, said he wants to know more about the attack. ""I've not seen all of the underlying intelligence. I still would like to -- hope to -- see that,"" said Warner. But Warner said he wants the intelligence community to address election interference efforts more fully, and he wants daily briefings on the threat leading up to Election Day. ""What I'd like to hear more from the intelligence community is not necessarily the circumstances around Iran, which are critically important, but past comments from the IC about Russian 'disinformation campaigns,'"" Warner said. ""I would hope the community would give a full report on all the threats we face,"" he continued. ""Again, the goal here is be non-biased, to be complete, to lay out all the threats active from Russia and Iran and potentially others. And I hope they will do this because none of these threats are going away. I hope they will do this on an ongoing basis over the next 11 days."" Some Republicans said Thursday that the threatening emails that purported to be from Proud Boys were designed to hurt President Donald Trump. ""Clearly Iran was trying to be able to create this whole spin that somehow a racist organization is supporting President Trump and so trying to be able to hurt President Trump by trying to be able to put all of these things out there that they knew would be public to be able to get out there,"" said Sen. James Lankford, R-Okla., who sits on the Homeland Security Committee. Lankford was among those who said Iran should be sanctioned, as Russians have been, a move the Trump administration took later Thursday afternoon. The Treasury Department announced it is sanctioning five Iranian entities for interfering in the 2020 presidential election, including Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and its elite branch the Quds Force -- both of which have long been under several U.S. sanctions. But the new sanctions also include the IRTVU and IUVM, two Quds Force-owned propaganda outlets, as well as Bayan Rasaneh Gostar Institute, which the Treasury Department said is a front company for the Quds Force. Texas Republican Congressman Michael McCaul told ABC News this latest incident is ""disturbing."" ""As I've said before, Vladimir Putin is not a friend to the United States,"" McCaul, who serves as the ranking member on the House Foreign Affairs Committee said. ""And while disturbing, it's no surprise that in addition to Russia, foreign adversaries like Iran and China are attempting to undermine our democratic institutions."" ""This most recent incident reminds us that we must do all we can to ensure the integrity of our election,"" McCaul said. ""Going forward, we must remain vigilant against efforts to sow discord and send a clear message to those responsible: the United States will not tolerate it."" ABC News has learned that Russia and Iran successfully penetrated systems containing voter registration data at the local level, according to two government officials. According to the sources, who had both been briefed on the intelligence, the security breaches went beyond data from publicly available sources, which was also obtained. The targeting and weaponization of voter registration information remains an ongoing threat and there are concerns that both countries may try to sow more discord and disinformation to American voters. The sources declined to say which jurisdictions and how many voters were involved. In Florida, where the threatening emails targeting Democrats originated, the secretary of state's office told ABC News there was no breach. ""There has been no breach to Florida's Voter Registration database. Information provided in submission of a Florida Voter's Registration,"" Mark Ard, the communications director for Florida Secretary of State Laurel Lee, said, adding that voter information is publicly accessible. Multiple states have said that their voting systems were not compromised. In a video released on Twitter by Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose, he said that federal partners informed election officials about the incident, although the timing is unknown. He assured Ohio voters it did not effect them. ""First of all, this did not impact Ohio, but of course, we're working with our federal counterparts monitoring the situation,"" LaRose said. ""We've been in close conversation with them. I really appreciate the work that DHS and FBI have done on this and the fact that they have been forward leaning and making sure that that states all over the nation and our states, elections officials throughout the nation, have been kept apprized of the situation."" In another battleground state, Wisconsin Elections Commission Administrator Meagan Wolfe said that there was no evidence that their voter registration system was hacked. ""Any data that was used to make these email contacts is publicly available,"" Wolfe said at a press conference. ""This is not data that came from statewide databases. So yesterday's announcement, I think the most important thing is it serves as a reminder to all of us as we head into the election, and that is to seek out trusted sources of election information.""

2020-10-22,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/US/russia-continues-spread-coronavirus-conspiracies-intel-bulletin-warns/story?id=73746560,"Russia continues to spread coronavirus conspiracies, intel bulletin warns","Russia and other foreign adversaries are ramping up efforts to spread conspiracy theories and disinformation about the coronavirus pandemic in the U.S., according to an internal U.S. intelligence bulletin obtained by ABC News – a development that critics say reflects another example of Trump and the Russians parroting similar talking points. The Oct. 19 intelligence bulletin, from analysts at the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and disseminated to federal state, and local law enforcement partners, noted the “re-emergence of domestic COVID-19 [misinformation and disinformation] narratives online"" from China and Iran, but emphasized the most harmful material is emanating from Russia. “Russia continues to spread COVID-19 disinformation and conspiracy theories that have the greatest potential to impact U.S. public health efforts,” according to the bulletin. The bulletin did not provide more details on the impact, and DHS declined to comment on the leaked document. The bulletin found that disinformation narratives appear to be gaining traction online, as “the volume of engagement [with these] narratives has increased since 02 October.” COVID has become one of the most politically consequential and charged topics in the upcoming election, with deep divisions emerging on masks, social distancing and lockdown measures and the use of certain therapeutics and vaccines. The disease's lethality, method of transmission and other key points have become the subject of intense scientific and political debate, deriving in part from misinformation and disinformation campaigns. While details of the specific conspiracies the Russians are peddling was not clear in the bulletin, several examples of coronavirus-related misinformation have emanated domestically – and often from the White House itself. The president’s mixed messages on the coronavirus – such as promoting untested therapies and calling into question the efficacy of wearing masks – has helped sow confusion and discord among Americans as they respond to the virus. The president has long faced scrutiny for misleading Americans about the pandemic. Perhaps most notably, during an interview with journalist Bob Woodward in March, Trump admitted to deliberately minimizing the seriousness of the disease publicly despite understanding its true danger. After testing positive for the virus earlier this month, Trump told Americans, “don’t be afraid of Covid,” prompting scrutiny from critics who accused him of minimizing a disease that had already taken more than 200,000 American lives. Critics say it is part of a pattern that harkens back to previous instances in which Trump has echoed messages aligned with misinformation from foreign adversaries. “For years a key part of the Russian disinformation playbook has relied on American elected officials and mainstream media personalities amplifying their narratives,” said John Cohen, an ABC News contributor and the former undersecretary for intelligence at DHS under President Barack Obama. “So from a national security perspective,” he continued, “it is highly disconcerting to see a growing number of instances in which these conspiracies promoted by Russia have been mimicked by the president and his supporters.” On several occasions in the past, Trump has promoted false narratives about other matters that match disinformation emanating from foreign adversaries. It has never been clear whether the president has taken his cues from the foreign adversaries or vice versa. Last month, for example, ABC News reported that Russia sought to “amplify” concerns about the integrity of U.S. elections by promoting allegations that mail-in voting will lead to widespread fraud – an unfounded complaint Trump has raised frequently in recent months. In the final weeks of the campaign, Trump has also tried to return focus to the business dealings of Vice President Joe Biden’s son, Hunter, in large part by supporting the efforts of his personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, to dig up dirt on the Democratic contender’s family. In September, the U.S. Treasury Department characterized one of Giuliani’s sources of information about the Bidens, Ukrainian politician Andrii Derkach, as a Russian agent. Giuliani said at the time that he had ""no reason to believe [Derkach] is a Russian agent.” “There is nothing I saw that said he was a Russian agent,” Giuliani said. “There is nothing he gave me that seemed to come from Russia at all."" The Washington Post later reported on a classified CIA finding that “[Russian] President Vladimir Putin and the senior most Russian officials are aware of and probably directing Russia’s influence operations aimed at denigrating the former U.S. Vice President” – including Derkach’s collaboration with Giuliani. In a statement responding to ABC News’ reporting last month, Tim Murtaugh, a Trump campaign spokesperson, said, ""We don't need or want any foreign interference,"" and added, ""President Trump will beat Joe Biden fair and square.”",20,,,,17

""This data can be used by foreign actors to attempt to communicate false information to registered voters that they hope will cause confusion, sow chaos, and undermine your confidence in American democracy,"" Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe said in a surprise news conference Wednesday evening. Ratcliffe also announced that Iran was separately behind a series of threatening emails that were found to be sent this week to Democratic voters, which he said was ""designed to intimidate voters, incite social unrest and damage President Trump."" Alireza Miryousefi, spokesman for the Iranian Mission to the U.N., denied the allegations to ABC News. ""Unlike the U.S., Iran does not interfere in other country's elections. The world has been witnessing U.S.'s own desperate public attempts to question the outcome of its own elections at the highest level,"" he said. ""These accusations are nothing more than another scenario to undermine voter confidence in the security of the U.S. election, and are absurd. Iran has no interest in interfering in the U.S. election and no preference for the outcome. The U.S. must end its malign and dangerous accusations against Iran."" Florida law enforcement and the FBI previously had said they were investigating the threatening emails allegedly sent from outside the United States to registered Democrats. The emails claimed to be from by a member of the Proud Boys, according to authorities, something the group denies. According to sheriffs' offices in both Brevard County and Alachua County, the sender claimed to belong to the ""alt-right"" group and said they were in possession of a voter's personal information. The Brevard County Sheriff's Office said the email addressed the voter by name, then stated: ""We are in possession of all your information. You are currently registered as a Democrat and we know this because we have gained access into the entire voting infrastructure. You will vote for Trump on Election Day or we will come after you."" President Donald Trump in the first presidential debate stirred controversy when, in response to a question about whether he condemned white supremacists, he told the ""Proud Boys"" to ""stand back and stand by."" Many argued the moment could serve to energize fringe members of the group to carry out acts of violence against opponents of the president. ""Iran has been a savvy follower of U.S. politics and saw the 'Proud Boys moment' in the last debate as an opportunity to build a narrative that would cast Trump supporters as threatening violence against Democratic voters,"" a senior administration official told ABC News, reacting to Ratcliffe's statement that Iran's actions were in part to damage Trump. Google said spam filters stopped 90% of the emails sent as part of Iran's alleged election interference. “We and others have seen evidence that an operation linked to Iran sent inauthentic emails to people in the U.S. over the past 24 hours,"" Google said in a statement overnight. ""For Gmail users, our automated spam filters stopped 90% of the approximately 25,000 emails sent. Additionally, this morning we removed one video file on Drive and one video on YouTube with fewer than 30 views, and terminated the associated Google accounts. We referred the matter to the FBI and will continue to work with law enforcement and others in the industry to identify and remove any related content.” Ratcliffe additionally accused Iran of distributing content including a video implying individuals ""could cast fraudulent ballots, even from overseas."" ""This video and any claims about such allegedly fraudulent ballots are not true,"" Ratcliffe said. ""These actions are desperate attempts by desperate adversaries. Even if the adversaries pursue further attempts to intimidate or attempt to undermine border confidence, know that our election systems are resilient and you can be confident your votes are secure."" FBI Director Christopher Wray separately appeared at the news conference to assure Americans that the bureau will not tolerate attempts at foreign interference in the U.S. election, and would alert the American people when appropriate when it discovers such activity. ""When we see indications of foreign interference or federal election crimes, we are going to aggressively investigate and work with our partners to take appropriate action,"" Wray said. ""You should be confident that your vote counts. Early, unverified claims to the contrary should be viewed with a healthy dose of skepticism."" The White House reacted late Wednesday, taking a shot at former President Barack Obama and the president's election opponent in the process. ""Unlike the Obama-Biden Administration, President Trump has and will always put America First,"" White House press secretary Judd Deere said in a statement. ""He has directed the FBI, DOJ, and defense and intel agencies to proactively monitor and thwart any attempts to interfere in US elections, and because of the great work of our law enforcement agencies we have stopped an attempt by America’s adversaries to undermine our elections."" The announcement followed a joint statement by the Senate Intelligence Committee chairs Marco Rubio and ranking member Mark Warner concerning election security. ""Our adversaries abroad seek to sow chaos and undermine voters' belief in our democratic institutions, including the election systems and infrastructure that we rely on to record and properly report expressions of the voters' will,"" the statement said. ""They may seek to target those systems, or simply leave the impression that they have altered or manipulated those systems, in order to undermine their credibility and our confidence in them."" Former top Department of Homeland Security official and ABC News contributor John Cohen said the announcement shows ""we are not doing enough to protect our election process."" ""Tonight we have learned that foreign entities were able to access voter registration information and send intimidating emails to American voters that were intended to influence how they vote,"" Cohen said. ""The president needs to take this threat seriously, stop spreading Russian disinformation and he needs to tell his allies on Capitol Hill to stop chasing conspiracy theories and instead start focusing on protecting America from foreign attacks.""

2020-10-19,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/doj-announces-charges-russian-gru-officers-allegedly-involved/story?id=73698190,"DOJ announces charges against 6 Russian military officers allegedly involved in hacking, malware operations","The Justice Department Monday announced an indictment against six Russia GRU officers charged with engaging in a series of hacking and malware deployment operations to attack other countries' infrastructure, elections and other actions designed to further Russia's interests. The indictment specifically accuses the six alleged hackers of engaging in computer intrusions ""intended to support Russian government efforts to undermine, retaliate against or otherwise destabilize"" Ukraine, Georgia, elections in France, the 2018 PyeongChang Olympic Games and international efforts to hold Russia accountable for its use of the nerve agent Novichok on foreign soil. According to the Justice Department, several members of the same military group were previously charged for their role in Russia's efforts to interfere in the 2016 election, though the allegations in Monday's indictment do not relate to U.S. election interference. U.S. officials at virtual press conference at DOJ described the hacking campaign as among ""the most destructive and costly cyber-attacks in history,"" dealing with ""some of the world's most destructive malware to date."" Assistant Attorney General for National Security John Demers argued the allegations prove why the U.S. should ignore a recent offer extended by Russia calling for a cyber ""reset"" between the two countries. ""This indictment lays bare Russia’s use of its cyber capabilities to destabilize and interfere with the domestic political and economic systems of other countries, thus providing a cold reminder of why its proposal is nothing more than dishonest rhetoric and cynical and cheap propaganda,"" Demers said. Some of the malware deployed by the officers, according to prosecutors, included Killdisk, Industroyer and NotPetya, believed to be the most costly and destructive cyber attack in history which led to nearly $1 billion in losses for three victims named in the indictment -- including the Heritage Valley health system in Pennsylvania. ""The attack caused the unavailability of patient lists, patient history, physical examination files, and laboratory records,"" the DOJ said in a press release. ""Heritage Valley lost access to its mission-critical computer systems (such as those relating to cardiology, nuclear medicine, radiology, and surgery) for approximately one week and administrative computer systems for almost one month, thereby causing a threat to public health and safety."" The group also is alleged to have engaged in a spearphishing campaign targeting the 2018 Winter Olympic Games, launching what officials described as the ""Olympic Destroyer"" malware attack during the opening ceremony that deleted data from thousands of computers supporting the games. ""The conspirators, feeling the embarrassment of international penalties related to Russia’s state-sponsored doping program, i.e., cheating, took it upon themselves to undermine the games,"" Demers said. ""Their cyber attack combined the emotional maturity of a petulant child with the resources of a nation state."" Later in the press conference, Demers was asked whether the U.S. has any evidence of intelligence that the GRU might seek to carry out similar operations targeting the upcoming election. “With respect to the elections that are coming up, you know we haven't seen anything that caused us to question what we've I think repeatedly said and what the intelligence community's repeatedly said -- that Americans should be confident that a vote for their candidate will be counted for that candidate,"" Demers answered.",20,,,,5
2020-09-29,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-biden-issues-election-security-integrity/story?id=73244844,Trump vs. Biden on the issues: Election security and integrity,"Russia's ongoing brazen efforts to interfere in the presidential election -- as they did four years ago -- remains a principal concern among national security officials, along with other adversaries including China. But unlike in 2016, the rapid and sweeping embrace of vote-by-mail in response to the coronavirus pandemic injects new uncertainty about election security, as millions prepare to vote in an alternative way. Fueling those anxieties over mail voting, which is underway in several states, is President Trump’s unsubstantiated allegations of rampant fraud, even as dozens of state election officials tell ABC News that they have confidence in the system. His campaign against vote-by-mail throughout the cycle exceeds similar efforts he made in 2016, when he argued, without evidence, that voter fraud was the only reason Hillary Clinton won the popular vote. His own voting integrity commission found no evidence of that. The integrity of this year's matchup between Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden has taken on an outsized role in the increasingly competitive political environment, as attempts to undermine confidence in the democratic process mount both from outside the country's borders and from inside the Oval Office. Biden has attempted to combat Trump’s onslaught by pointing out that Trump himself has voted-by-mail in Florida from the White House. Some elections experts argue Trump’s offensive against mail-in voting is a voter suppression tool, which could lay the ""groundwork for contesting a close election if he loses, "" wrote Rick Hasen, a professor of law and political science at the University of California, Irvine, and the author of ""Election Meltdown: Dirty Tricks, Distrust and the Threat to American Democracy."" ""The most benign explanation for Mr. Trump’s obsessive focus on mail-in balloting is that he is looking for an excuse for a possible loss to his Democratic opponent, Joe Biden, in November. The less benign explanation is that he is seeking to sow chaos to drive down turnout and undermine the legitimacy of the election,"" wrote Hasen. At the first presidential debate on Tuesday at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio, the two rivals are set to spar over the integrity of the election, one of the topics previewed by the Commission on Presidential Debates. Here's what we know about the candidates' histories with and stances on the issue: Even before this year’s election, questions about the integrity of the 2016 race dogged Trump throughout his presidency after intelligence officials disclosed an extensive influence campaign directed by Russian President Vladimir Putin himself to aid Trump. A bipartisan Senate panel this year affirmed the intelligence community's assertions, rejecting the notion that the intelligence community was biased against Trump in its approach. The disclosure of the influence campaign and an investigation into whether his team was colluding with Russia cast a ""cloud,"" as Trump described it, over the early years of his first term. Even after the probe by Robert Mueller, the special counsel appointed to investigate Russian meddling, found that it could not substantiate the collusion or conspiracy allegations, the issue remained a sore point with the president. Losing the popular vote by millions and winning some states by thin margins kept Trump on the defensive with critics, who continued to assert that his victory might have been undeserved. Trump repeatedly dismissed the suggestion of Russian playing a role in putting him in the White House, and cast his team's involvement with Russian operatives as a ""hoax,"" while blaming the Obama administration, including Biden, for being asleep at the switch. Asked about Trump doubting Russia’s interference in 2016, Biden said in an interview with CBS in October 2019, ""He is an idiot — in terms of saying that. Everybody knows this. Everybody knows it. Nobody doubts it."" Ahead of the 2018 midterms, national security officials again warned that Russia was at it again. In the wake of the midterms, the intelligence community reported that while the vote had not been compromised, influence campaigns, including from Russia and Iran, persisted. The review stemmed from a September 2018 executive order mandating regular election assessments. This year, election security has emerged at the center of the 2020 presidential race in part by Trump's own making -- he has relentlessly assailed the use of the mail-in voting with unfounded suggestions of widespread fraud. ""The only way we're going to lose this election is if the election is rigged,"" he said during a visit to Wisconsin in August. Trump made the same assertion in the lead-up to the 2016 race. For months leading into this fall, Trump has sought to sow distrust in the voting practice, including baselessly suggesting that foreign actors could take advantage, just as the country is relying on it most. Before November, at least 32 states, plus Washington, D.C. have adjusted their election blueprints to expand options for voters and to make voting more accessible due to COVID-19. Trump ramped up his warnings of widespread fraud last week, even declining to commit to a peaceful transition of power if he were to lose the election, and pushing his belief that mail-in ballots will be the problem. ""Get rid of the ballots and you'll have a very peaceful -- there won't be a transfer,"" he said. ""What country are we in?"" Biden said, when a reporter asked him to respond. "" I don’t know what to say about it, but it doesn’t surprise me."" In a later interview with MSNBC, Biden said the American people will be heard. ""Every vote in this country is gonna be heard, and they’ll not be stopped,"" he said. ""I am confident all the irresponsible, outrageous attacks on voting -- we’ll have an election in this country that we always have had. And he’ll leave."" The president’s efforts come as his own campaign and state Republican parties encourage supporters to use mail-in voting through ads, online posts, and robocalls -- and as his own intelligence officials refute his narrative. ""We have not seen, historically, any kind of coordinated national voter fraud effort in a major election, whether it's by mail or otherwise,"" FBI Director Christopher Wray said before Congress Thursday. Biden, for his part, explicitly backed the nationwide push to expand voting-by-mail in response to the pandemic, even calling on Congress to provide more funding to aid states in their efforts, while casting Trump's strategy as ""un-American."" His campaign is also building out its legal operation in anticipation of a major fight over voting this fall, bringing on two former U.S. solicitors general and other top attorneys to oversee what could devolve into a fierce battle over the November's results. Further stoking concerns over the integrity of the election regarding mail-in voting is the Trump administration’s assault on one of the country’s most storied institutions, the United States Postal Service. The USPS implemented controversial cost-cutting measures under Trump-installed postmaster general Louis DeJoy, which some critics argued could have adverse impacts on the election by slowing mail delivery. Those changes were halted by a federal judge earlier this month. House Democrats passed a bill in August that would've allocated an additional $25 billion in funding to USPS, a cash injection the agency's board of governors -- whose Senate-confirmed members were all appointed by Trump -- requested from Congress back in early April because of anticipated losses. Trump has attempted to use this as evidence that USPS won't be able to handle the increased mail-in voting, asserting, ""they don't have the money to do the universal mail-in voting. So therefore, they can't do it,"" Trump said on Aug. 12. But DeJoy rebuffed Trump, saying on Friday, ""we’re equipped to do it and we’re going to deliver the ballots."" The president has also raised the possibility of foreign governments trying to interfere in the presidential election by taking advantage of the increase in mail-in voting, an unproven claim that he first made after Attorney General Bill Barr suggested that foreign countries could do this, and that it would be hard for U.S. election officials to detect it, during an interview on Fox News in June. ""The biggest risk that we have is mail-in ballots, because with a mail-in ballot -- well, universal mail-in ballots, it is a much easier thing for a foreign power, whether it's Russia, China, Iran, North Korea...it's much easier for them to forge ballots and send them in,"" Trump said in early August. ""It's much easier for them to cheat with universal mail-in ballots."" However, election officials, and the FBI, have disputed this scenario, citing the safeguards and specificities in place -- like ballots being printed on special paper or having unique barcodes on them -- that make this highly unlikely to happen, never mind happen undetected. Russia’s attempts to meddle extend beyond mail voting. In early September, ABC News reported that the Department of Homeland Security withheld publication of an intelligence bulletin in early July warning law enforcement agencies of a Russian scheme to attack Biden’s mental fitness, according to internal emails and a draft of the document obtained by ABC News. The bulletin detailing Russia’s campaign against Biden’s mental health again echoes Trump’s own rhetoric -- and indicates the most specific example to date of Moscow’s intentions to influence November’s election. There is no evidence to suggest that Biden's not mentally fit to be president, and both he and his campaign have pushed against this narrative from Trump. In June of last year, Trump even said in an exclusive interview with ABC News he would ""listen"" if foreign governments offered dirt on political opponents. ""I think you might want to listen, there isn't anything wrong with listening,"" Trump told ABC News Chief Anchor George Stephanopoulos. ""If somebody called from a country, Norway, [and said] ‘we have information on your opponent' -- oh, I think I'd want to hear it."" But Russia isn’t the only foreign country seeking to sway America’s vote. Back in August, a public statement issued by the U.S. intelligence community revealed that three of the nation’s top adversaries are actively attempting to meddle in the presidential race, including efforts by Russia to advance Trump's reelection efforts. Intelligence officials also concluded that ""China prefers that President Trump – whom Beijing sees as unpredictable – does not win reelection."" Iran, it found, ""seeks to undermine U.S. democratic institutions, President Trump, and to divide the country in advance of the 2020 elections."" Asked about the statement, Trump deflected, turning the question back on the reporter. ""We're gonna look at that very closely, but you started off with Russia. Why don't you start off with China? We think China's maybe a bigger threat,"" Trump said during a press conference at his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey. Trump has frequently downplayed intelligence showing Russia’s aim to aid his campaign in 2016, while Biden excoriated his rival’s administration for failing to take action to prevent foreign election interference, and said that he is putting the Kremlin and other foreign governments ""on notice."" ""If elected president, I will treat foreign interference in our election as an adversarial act that significantly affects the relationship between the United States and the interfering nation's government,"" Biden wrote as part of a lengthy statement. In the wake of the intelligence community’s statement, which did not explicitly say that China is aiding Biden, Tony Blinken, a foreign policy advisor with the Biden campaign, said that the former vice president ""has led the fight against foreign interference for years, and has refused to accept any foreign materials intended to help him in this election - something that Donald Trump and his campaign have repeatedly failed to do."" However, the last time Biden was in the White House, the Obama administration did not publicly comment on Russia’s efforts until October of 2016, when they accused the foreign government of hacking political institutions, including the Department of Homeland Security, and interfering in the election. Former DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson defended that delay in June 2017, saying that there has to be consideration given to protecting sources and methods, and also, that “many would criticize us for perhaps taking sides in the election.” But according to a bipartisan conclusion reached by members of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence in June 2018, the Obama-Biden administration did not do enough to combat Russia’s election meddling during the 2016 campaign. Vice Chairman Mark Warner, D-Va., described officials as being “caught flat-footed.” The overt differences between Biden and Trump on election security, experts say, crystallize the ""stark illustration"" between the two men in their approaches to national security. ""The president seems to see foreign interference and election security issues as an opportunity to advance his political agenda,"" said John Cohen, an ABC News contributor and former Department of Homeland Security undersecretary for intelligence who worked in both the Bush and Obama administrations. ""Joe Biden tends to view them as issues that need to be solved to protect the security and safety of America…as a way to articulate his vision on security."" The significance of election security is perhaps uniquely paramount this cycle, Cohen said, because ""this election is happening in an extraordinarily volatile time in our country"" -- between the coronavirus pandemic and the unrest over racial inequality. And Trump ""seems to be fanning the flames,"" he added.",20,,,,22
2020-09-24,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/federal-election-fraud-major-challenge-adversary-fbi-director/story?id=73216208,Federal election fraud would be 'a major challenge for an adversary': FBI director,"The FBI Director told the Senate Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee on Thursday that it would be difficult for a foreign government to change the outcome of a national election through mail-in ballot fraud. ""Now we have not seen, historically, any kind of coordinated national voter fraud effort in a major election, whether it's by mail or otherwise we have seen voter fraud,"" said FBI Director Christopher Wray, appearing before the committee to discuss threats the homeland faces. ""Certainly to change a federal election outcome, by mounting that kind of fraud at scale would be a major challenge for an adversary, but people should make no mistake, we're vigilant,"" he said. His comments came as President Donald Trump has repeatedly warned of widespread fraud as the result of expanded mail-in voting. When asked about ways to combat malign foreign influence, Wray encouraged voters to be ""critical thinkers"" and to get their news from a variety of sources. Director of the National Counterterrorism Center Christopher Miller and DHS Senior Official Performing the Duties of the Deputy Secretary Ken Cuccinelli also appeared before the committee Thursday. A similar hearing occured in the House last week. Last week, Wray echoed the intelligence community's assessment that Russia is actively continuing to try to influence the U.S. election. ""The intelligence community's consensus is that Russia continues to try to influence our elections, primarily through what we would call malign foreign influence, as opposed to what we saw in 2016, where there was also an effort to target election infrastructure, cyber targeting,"" he said. The Trump administration, and the president in particular, has repeatedly claimed that China is a bigger threat to election security than Russia. ""But Chris, you don’t see any activity from China, even though it is a FAR greater threat than Russia, Russia, Russia. They will both, plus others, be able to interfere in our 2020 Election with our totally vulnerable Unsolicited (Counterfeit?) Ballot Scam. Check it out!"" the President tweeted shortly after Wray's testimony last week. In an early August statement, the office of the Director of National Intelligence singled out Russia, China and Iran as potential disruptor countries during the 2020 election. On Thursday, Wray said he can’t rank the those three countries in terms of which is the biggest threat to the 2020 presidential election and that each country is focused on a different issue. ""I don't think I could really rank them, I mean all three are ones that we're very concerned about in different ways. So it's not really an apple to apple comparison,"" he explained. He also sidestepped the question on Chinese election interference. ""As I mentioned before, in many ways, [China is] our greatest counterintelligence threat to this country and their malign foreign influence efforts are different. As Mr. Cuccinelli said, different from the Russians but much broader and wider, in terms of their reach to not just federal officials but state local officials, and they use economic leavers very heavily."" Wray also tackled the issue of protests around the country. The FBI director reiterated a point he made last week in front of the House that the FBI does not investigate the ideology of demonstrators. ""Now let me be clear, we do not investigate groups or individuals based on ideology or on the exercise of First Amendment protected activity alone but when the ideology leads someone to commit criminal acts and pursue violence, the FBI will not hesitate to take appropriate action,"" he said. Wray testified that that his agency is working with state and local law enforcement officials to see if federal charges can be brought against some of those protesters who have been arrested. Cuccinelli was put on the spot when asked about two whistleblower complaints DHS is facing. Former DHS Intelligence and Analysis director Brian Murphy claims he ""was instructed by Mr. Wolf and/or Mr. Cuccinelli to modify intelligence assessments to ensure they matched up with the public comments by President Trump on the subject of ANTIFA and ‘anarchist’ groups."" ""Oh absolutely that did not happen,"" Cuccinelli said, adding that the language in a DHS upcoming threats report on white supremacists was not toned down, as was alleged. Democrats on the House Homeland Security committee also announced last week the start of a new investigation into allegations from a detention facility nurse, including reports that ICE detainees in the Irwin County Detention Center were subjected to hysterectomy operations without their full understanding or consent. ABC News has not confirmed this reporting. Cuccinelli said that the allegations were ""shocking"" and that he immediately dispatched a team outside of ICE, including a Coast Guard attorney and an Army nurse, to review records at the Georgia facility. ""I'm happy to report that, at this stage the inspector general is still doing a more in depth review, but at this stage the documentation indicates that there were, over the course of four years, two hysterectomies were performed on two women and that is confirmed by the nearby medical facility where those procedures took place. They came to the same numerical conclusion that that we did but, as I said, the inspector general is continuing to investigate that.""",20,,,,22
2020-09-23,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/acting-department-homeland-security-secretary-chad-wolf-set/story?id=73173301,"Wolf defends DHS at confirmation hearing, calling whistleblower's claims 'patently false'","Acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf defended the DHS Wednesday, saying at his confirmation hearing before the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee that a whistleblower's claims against the department are ""patently false."" Former chief of intelligence at the DHS, Brian Murphy, filed a whistleblower complaint describing repeated instances in which he claims the Trump administration sought to ""censor or manipulate"" intelligence for political purposes, including information about Russian efforts to interfere in the 2020 elections. The document, a copy of which was obtained by ABC News, alleges a pattern of behavior ranging from ""attempted abuse of authority"" to possible violations of federal law perpetrated by some of the administration's senior-most law enforcement and intelligence officials. President Donald Trump formally nominated Wolf for the secretary job in August, but he has been serving as the acting secretary since November. If confirmed by the Senate, Wolf would be the first confirmed DHS Secretary in over a year. Wolf was also adamant on Wednesday that he did not withhold an intelligence report on disinformation on former Vice President Biden’s mental health. ABC News previously reported that DHS withheld publication of an intelligence bulletin warning law enforcement agencies of a Russian scheme to promote “allegations about the poor mental health” of Biden. Wolf, asked specifically if he considers Russia to be advancing propaganda against Biden, said there are three countries are a concern. ""On everything that I've seen that there are three nation states that we have to be very concerned about one is Russia, one is China, and one is Iran and they all have different ways in different motivations of doing this,"" he said. On immigration, Wolf has been a loyal supporter of Trump's agenda even as U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which falls under DHS, faces continued scrutiny over medical care in civil detention facilities. Democrats on the House Homeland Security committee announced last week the start of a new investigation into allegations from a detention facility nurse, including reports that ICE detainees in the Irwin County Detention Center were subjected to hysterectomy operations without their full understanding or consent. Wolf said he looks forward to this review. ""I look forward to that investigation. Some of what we have seen thus far on some of the most, I would say, dramatic allegations in that complaint regarding certain medical procedures,"" he said. ""Some of the facts on the ground and the fact that we have seen do not back up those allegations."" ABC News has not independently confirmed the allegations. A new report from the House Committee on Homeland Security found that officials used the threat of isolated confinement in order to maintain control over detainees at the River Correctional Center in Louisiana and Otero County Processing Center in New Mexico. Detainees who had submitted repeated medical requests or engaged in hunger strikes were segregated as a form of discipline, according to the report. The findings suggest that officials at three facilities ignored mental health warnings from detainees by minimizing some suicide red flags despite evidence of self harm. Evidence of suicide attempts at Otero, River, and the LaSalle ICE Processing Center in Louisiana were written off as not “serious,” according to the report. Wolf and the department's number two, Ken Cuccinelli, have also been in the hot seat after the Government Accountability Office found they were unlawfully appointed to their current roles. Wolf said that he disagrees with the logic used by the GAO and said its decision is non binding. “We're certainly aware of the GAO's opinion regarding the order of succession at the department I will say that we very strongly disagree with that opinion,"" Wolf said. ""I'll continue to say I respect the role that GAO plays. But that again does not dismiss the fact that we believe they have a faulty decision in the legal logic that they used is very inaccurate."" The DHS Inspector General declined to take action against the two leaders. ""While DHS OIG does not have a strict policy against reviewing matters that are the subject of litigation, under the particular circumstances presented it would be pointless for DHS OIG to add its voice to what has become a bitter inter-branch disagreement,"" the IG wrote in a letter to members of the House Homeland Security Committee. ""Neither GAO nor DHS OIG can issue a binding determination on that issue, but a federal court can and probably will."" Wolf's profile rose earlier this summer when he sent federal agents -- against the wishes of Oregon Gov. Kate Brown and Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler -- to quell violence occurring outside the federal courthouse in Portland, Oregon, during protests over police brutality and racial injustice. Wolf has largely defended the department's actions. ""We will be happy to provide resources to bring this violence to an end … across the ideological spectrum left or right, the violence needs to end."" Wolf said in August on ABC's ""This Week,"" adding a message to local officials, ""If you see this activity, take early action, bring law and order to your streets, and we can address and really avoid some of the violent activity that we're seeing.""",20,,,,24
2020-09-18,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/us-sends-bradley-fighting-vehicles-syria-boost-security/story?id=73104548,US sends Bradley Fighting Vehicles to Syria to boost security for troops following Russian encounter,"In a show of force, the U.S. military has sent armored fighting vehicles to eastern Syria to help protect the hundreds of American troops stationed there following a tense encounter with Russian forces last month that left seven American troops injured, said U.S. Central Command. A military spokesman said the deployment of Bradley Fighting Vehicles, advanced radars and increased flight patrols was a ""clear demonstration of U.S. resolve to defend Coalition forces"" in eastern Syria. ""U.S. Central Command has directed a number of actions in northeast Syria to help ensure the safety and security of Coalition forces,"" Capt. Bill Urban, a spokesman for U.S. Central Command, said in a statement. ""The United States has deployed Sentinel radar, increased the frequency of U.S. fighter patrols over U.S. forces, and deployed Bradley Fighting Vehicles to augment U.S. forces in the Eastern Syria Security Area (ESSA),"" he added. ""These actions are a clear demonstration of U.S. resolve to defend Coalition forces in the ESSA, and to ensure that they are able to continue their Defeat-ISIS mission without interference,"" said Urban. ""The United States does not seek conflict with any other nation in Syria, but will defend Coalition forces if necessary,"" said Urban. A U.S. official said that six Bradley Fighting Vehicles arrived in Syria early Friday from Kuwait and that their deployment along with the forces manning the radar equipment will add an additional 100 personnel to the 500 American forces operating in eastern Syria. An additional 100 to 200 U.S. military personnel are stationed at a remote outpost along a major southern highway near the border with Jordan that is a transit point for Iranian weapons to Hezabollah and Syrian President Bashar Assad's regime. The deployment of the Bradleys is a direct result of the Aug. 26 incident where a Russian armored vehicle rammed an American military patrol vehicle injuring seven service members. ""These actions and reinforcements are a clear signal to adhere to mutual de-confliction processes and for Russia and other parties to avoid unprofessional and unsafe and provocative action in eastern Syria,"" said the U.S. official. That incident was deemed serious enough that Gen. Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, phoned his Russian counterpart to express concerns about Russian actions that some officials described as ""reckless."" The deployment is intended as a show of force to Russian troops that have been encroaching on the U.S. military's areas of operations east of the Euphrates River. Russian troops are supposed to operate west of that river, and American military officials have said that despite Russian claims their troops were not cleared to operate in the U.S. zone on the day of the incident. There are about 500 American troops in eastern Syria operating in eastern Syria as part of a mission to protect Kurdish oil fields from ISIS. Bradley Fighting Vehicles were first deployed to Syria last October as the first visible sign of the new American mission to protect the Kurdish oil fields. That mission followed President Donald Trump's initial decision to pull all 2,000 U.S. troops out of Syria following Turkey's invasion targeting Kurdish forces. But the deployment was brief as they were removed three weeks after they had arrived and were replaced by additional forces. The deployment came on the same day Trump said during a briefing that U.S. was ""out of Syria,"" before adding the caveat of just protecting ""the oil."" ""We are out of Syria, other than we kept the oil. I kept the oil, and we have troops guarding the oil. Other than that, we are out of Syria,"" Trump said. ""We're out of Syria, except we kept the oil and we will make a determination, we’ll probably be dealing with the Kurds on the oil, and see what it all ends up, but we’ll be out,"" he added. The U.S.-led anti-ISIS coalition said in a statement that the new deployment of Bradley Fighting Vehicles were all from the 2nd Brigade Combat Team, 1st Armored Division currently deployed to Kuwait.",7,,,,6
2020-09-17,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/fbi-director-christopher-wray-insists-agency-works-american/story?id=73070388,FBI Director Christopher Wray insists the agency works 'for the American people',"In testimony before the House Homeland Security Committee on Thursday, FBI Director Christopher Wray said that the bureau works for nobody but the American people after Attorney General William Barr said Wednesday night that its agents work for him. In remarks at Hillsdale College's ""Constitution Day"" celebration, Barr recounted what he described as his own meetings with FBI agents in which he posed the the question: ""Whose agents do you think you are?"" ""These people are agents of the attorney general,"" Barr said. ""I don't say this in a pompous way, but that is the chain of authority and legitimacy in the Department of Justice."" When asked by Florida Rep. Val Demings about the comments, Wray said he had not heard them yet. ""Well, I'm not familiar with that particular comment from the attorney general,"" he said. ""I will say, we, the FBI, work for the American people."" Wray's appearance in front of the committee was part of the annual Worldwide Threats hearing in which agency heads provide an evaluation of threats facing the U.S. One notable agency head was missing, though -- acting Department of Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf. Wolf, who was subpoenaed to appear, defied the order to come before the committee, citing his pending nomination as secretary for the department. The department instead offered to have the senior official performing the duties of deputy secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, Ken Cuccinelli, testify in Wolf's place, but the committee declined, according to the DHS. Senate Homeland Security committee staff met with Wolf about his confirmation Thursday, two committee aides and the DHS confirmed to ABC News. It is unclear whether the meeting took place during the time he was supposed to be testifying in front of the House Homeland Security Committee. Democratic members expressed disappointment that Wolf was not in attendance, while Republican members defended him and the department, accusing Democrats of conducting political theater. In Wolf's absence, Wray was left in the hot seat to face questions about everything from the assessment of the nation's election security to various threats from homegrown violent extremists. Wray echoed the intelligence community's assessment that Russia is actively continuing to try to influence the U.S. election. ""The intelligence community's consensus is that Russia continues to try to influence our elections, primarily through what we would call malign foreign influence, as opposed to what we saw in 2016, where there was also an effort to target election infrastructure, cyber targeting,"" he said. The FBI director said that the agency has seen ""very active"" efforts by the Russians to influence the 2020 election and that Russians are focusing on using social media and other proxies to ""sow divisiveness and discord."" The focus of these efforts by the Russians is to ""primarily to denigrate (former) Vice President (Joe) Biden, and what the Russians see is kind of an anti-Russian establishment,"" Wray said, adding that the bureau's partnerships with social media companies are crucial for combatting misinformation and disinformation in 2020. ""There are things that they can do and they have resources to take responsibility for things that are happening on their own platforms, much more quickly, and -- and within greater legal flexibility under their terms of use in terms of service than we could do."" Asked about the history of widespread voter fraud since both the president and attorney general have baselessly argued that a mass expansion of mail-in voting will result in that outcome, Wray said there was no such historical precedent. ""We have not seen a danger of a coordinated national voter fraud effort in a major election,"" Wray said. ""We've certainly investigated voter fraud committed by mail, it's typically been at the local level."" Wray was pressed repeatedly by both Democrats and Republicans about the particular ideology of protesters involved in some of the violent unrest across the country since the killing of George Floyd while in police custody, and on numerous occasions Wray said that the FBI doesn't investigate ideology but rather criminal behavior. ""We're agnostic about the ideology, we don't investigate the ideology, but when the ideology inspires violence, we will investigate the violence aggressively,"" he said. Wray also said that the FBI has taken on more than 1,000 ongoing domestic terrorist investigations since the start of 2020 and that the FBI has arrested 120 people who have wanted to carry out violent acts in the United States. He added that of the racially motivated attacks that the FBI has investigated and prosecuted, those expressing a white supremacist ideology are responsible for the majority of incidents. ""People subscribing to some kind of white supremacist type ideology is certainly the biggest chunk of that,"" he said. Wray was quick to say that all those charged for racially-motivated attacks fit the ""category of anti-government anti-authority, which covers everything from anarchist violent extremists to militia types -- we don't really think in terms of left right.""",20,,,,18
2020-09-10,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/microsoft-warns-unsuccessful-attacks-campaigns-russian-china-iran/story?id=72932618,"Microsoft warns of 'unsuccessful attacks' on campaigns from Russian, China, Iran","Microsoft announced Thursday afternoon that it ""detected and stopped"" a series of cyberattacks emanating from hackers in Russia, China and Iran that targeted ""people and organizations involved in the upcoming presidential election, including unsuccessful attacks on people associated with both the Trump and Biden campaigns."" The warning from the tech giant targets the same three foreign actors identified by American intelligence officials as seeking to undermine faith in the upcoming election. The company says that Russian-based hacking group Strontium, ""has evolved its tactics since the 2016 election to include new reconnaissance tools and new techniques to obfuscate their operations."" Strontium has ""engaged in brute force attacks and password spray, two tactics that have likely allowed them to automate aspects of their operations,"" according to Microsoft. The group, which targeted both Democrats and Republicans, were mentioned in the special counsel Robert Mueller's report on election interference for similar behavior in 2016, Microsoft said. Microsoft concluded that a Chinese-based group ""indirectly and unsuccessfully targeted the Joe Biden for President campaign through non-campaign email accounts belonging to people affiliated with the campaign. The group has also targeted at least one prominent individual formerly associated with the Trump Administration."" Chris Krebs, director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency in the Department of Homeland Security, said that the agency was ""aware"" of the Microsoft report. ""It is important to highlight that none are involved in maintaining or operating voting infrastructure and there was no identified impact on election systems,"" Krebs said in a statement to ABC News. ""The announcement is consistent with earlier statements by the Intelligence Community on a range of malicious cyber activities targeting the 2020 campaign and reinforces that this is an all-of-nation effort to defend democracy."" Krebs urged anyone involved with the political process to ""stay alert"" for these malicious actors. The FBI also told ABC News that it was aware of the recent reporting, but would not comment further. ""Cyber intrusions affecting campaign or election infrastructure have the potential to cause significant negative impacts on the integrity of elections. Our adversaries are continuously looking for vulnerable US networks to exploit, and networks associated with political organizations and campaigns are no exception,"" the FBI said in a statement. Both agencies urged Americans to report any potential cyber intrusions to the government. In August, a senior FBI official told reporters on a conference call that both Russia and China are trying to disrupt the U.S. election. Earlier this week, the Department of Homeland Security found that Russia is spreading disinformation regarding former Vice President Joe Biden's mental health, according to a DHS bulletin obtained by ABC News. Russian actors are spreading ""unsubstantiated allegations"" that former Biden is of ""ill-health,"" the DHS bulletin said, and speculated that ""this narrative will resonate with some American voters and reduce their confidence in him as a candidate."" The warning from Microsoft comes as a former senior Department of Homeland Security official filed a whistleblower complaint claiming the Trump administration sought to ""censor or manipulate"" intelligence for political purposes, including information about Russian efforts to interfere in the 2020 election. The complaint was filed with the DHS inspector general this week by Brian Murphy, a veteran law enforcement official who until recently ran the agency's intelligence branch. The document, a copy of which was obtained by ABC News, alleged a pattern of behavior ranging from ""attempted abuse of authority"" to possible violations of federal law perpetrated by some of the administration's senior-most law enforcement and intelligence officials. Last month, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence warned that Russia, China and Iran ""continue to use covert and overt influence measures in their attempts to sway U.S. voters' preferences and perspectives, shift U.S. policies, increase discord in the United States, and undermine the American people's confidence in our democratic process.""",20,,,,25
2020-09-09,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/whistleblower-details-alleged-politicization-intelligence-dhs/story?id=72904622,Whistleblower details alleged politicization of intelligence at DHS,"[This report was updated Friday, Sept. 11.] The former chief of intelligence at the Department of Homeland Security has filed a whistleblower complaint describing repeated instances in which he claims the Trump administration sought to “censor or manipulate” intelligence for political purposes, including information about Russian efforts to interfere in the 2020 elections. The complaint was filed with the DHS inspector general this week by Brian Murphy, a veteran law enforcement official who until recently ran the agency’s intelligence branch. The document, a copy of which was obtained by ABC News, alleges a pattern of behavior ranging from “attempted abuse of authority” to possible violations of federal law perpetrated by some of the administration’s senior-most law enforcement and intelligence officials. According to Murphy, in addition to efforts to downplay Russia’s role in election meddling, those leaders sought to downplay the threat posed by domestic white supremacy groups and manipulate statistics about terrorist entries along the southern border. Over the course of 24 pages, Murphy describes an environment in which senior officials – including former Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, current acting Secretary Chad Wolf, and current Acting Deputy Secretary Ken Cuccinelli – scrambled to gather and prepare intelligence reports that aligned with President Donald Trump’s political message and public remarks. A spokesperson for DHS said in a statement, ""The Department generally does not comment on the specifics of OIG referrals, but we flatly deny that there is any truth to the merits of Mr. Murphy’s claim. DHS looks forward to the results of any resulting investigation and we expect it will conclude that no retaliatory action was taken against Mr. Murphy."" Wolf also defended the agency against allegations of politicization in a speech on Wednesday. ""Admidst the shifting series of challenges, a vocal and ill-informed minority has clamored to paint recent DHS actions as examples of mission drift or politicization,"" he said. ""They could not be more wrong."" Wolf also defended the agency against allegations of politicization in a speech on Wednesday. ""Admidst the shifting series of challenges, a vocal and ill-informed minority has clamored to paint recent DHS actions as examples of mission drift or politicization,"" he said. ""They could not be more wrong."" In one example dating back to May, Murphy claims he was “instructed” by Wolf “to cease providing intelligence assessments on the threat of Russian interference in the United States, and instead start reporting on interference activities by China and Iran.” ""Mr. Wolf stated that these instructions specifically originated from White House National Security Advisor Robert O’Brien,"" the complaint reads. ""Mr. Murphy informed Mr. Wolf he would not comply with these instructions, as doing so would put the country in substantial and specific danger."" In another, Murphy says he was asked to “ensure the intelligence assessments he produced for Secretary Nielsen’s review supported the policy argument that large numbers of [known or suspected terrorists] were entering the United States through the southwest border.” Murphy contends the true number “consisted of no more than three” known or suspected terrorists during the previous year. Murphy's complaint takes issue with the administration's use of statistics including ""special interest aliens""-- a bigger group than known and suspected terrorists, defined by DHS as individuals with ""suspicious travel patterns who may pose a national security risk"" -- as well as individuals stopped from entering the country at other entry points, like airports, in publicly reporting much larger figures. When he provided information for then-Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, aides would follow up ""seeking to have the underlying intelligence data reinterpreted to fit the White House’s policy,"" Murphy alleged in the complaint. Murphy also alleged Nielsen misled lawmakers during congressional hearings about the specific number of known or suspected terrorists attempting to enter the country through the southern border, but an attorney for Nielsen vehemently denied that accusation. James Wareham, Nielsen's attorney, told ABC News Wednesday that Murphy’s allegations “would be laughable if they were not so defamatory.” “A child of six could read the congressional testimony and understand that she never said anything like he said she said,” Wareham said. In a December 2018 hearing, Nielsen answered a question regarding the southern border wall, and then added, ""The idea of having folks go to a point of entry and having impedance and denial as part of a wall system is to ensure that the flow is safe and orderly. What I can tell you is we stopped 3,000 special interest aliens at the border last year. We stopped 10 known and suspected terrorists from attempting to travel to the United States each year."" In a hearing in March 2019, Nielsen acknowledged that a ""majority"" of known or suspected terrorists were stopped attempting to enter the country via air travel. She declined then to say how many known or suspected terrorists had attempted to cross the southern border, claiming the figure was ""classified."" Thursday an attorney for Murphy filed a ""supplemental clarification,"" which was published online by the House intelligence committee, acknowledging that the complaint made an ""inaccurate"" statement when it claimed Nielsen had testified in December that 3,755 known or suspected terrorists attempted entry through the southern border. But the clarification continued to assert that Nielsen's testimony was misleading -- both regarding her later claim about the number of suspected terrorists stopped was ""classified,"" and the clarification alleges that her statement in December about the 10 suspected terrorists stopped each year was ""still false, to the extent it applies to the southwest border, which was the specific topic of the question."" Friday Wareham provided ABC News an additional statement regarding the complaint's correction, saying, “People in this town think nothing of falsely defaming dedicated public servants like Secretary Nielsen. She will no longer tolerate it. I ask that the media give the same attention to the retraction and apology as they did to the libelous statements that preceded it."" In another part of Murphy's complaint, he alleges as recently as July, Murphy claims he “was instructed by Mr. Wolf and/or Mr. Cuccinelli to modify intelligence assessments to ensure they matched up with the public comments by President Trump on the subject of ANTIFA and ‘anarchist’ groups.” Attorneys now representing Murphy, who was reassigned in August to the management division, encouraged the DHS inspector general to launch an investigation into the matters described in the complaint and what Murphy says were retaliatory actions taken against him for pushing back. “A thorough investigation will establish that the actions taken or threatened to be taken against Mr. Murphy were done in reprisal for his protected disclosures,” the complaint read. According to Murphy’s complaint, Miles Taylor, a former deputy chief of staff at DHS who has since left government and been critical of the administration, “intended to seek Mr. Murphy’s termination as a result of his declination to provide intelligence assessments” about possible terrorists sneaking into the U.S. through the southern border – an assessment that “Murphy felt were inconsistent with the underlying intelligence data."" With regard to the controversy about the southern border, Taylor told ABC News late Thursday, “The real story is that White House officials misstated the number of terrorists at the southern border, which is why Secretary Nielsen insisted DHS release a fact sheet to make very clear that few terrorists cross the southern border and most arrive by air."" ""The allegation -- that DHS officials tried to artificially play up the number of terrorists at the southern border -- is quite literally the opposite of what happened, is false, and should be immediately retracted,"" he said. On Wednesday, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., ordered Murphy to appear before his committee later this month. In a letter to Murphy’s legal team, Schiff wrote that the complaint “depicts a sustained and disturbing pattern of misconduct by senior Trump Administration officials.” Committee Republicans did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Contacted by ABC News, Cuccinelli did not have any immediate response to Murphy's complaint. White House deputy press secretary Sarah Matthews dismissed the allegations wholesale late Wednesday, accusing Murphy of ""politicizing election security"" with ""specious complaints based on false allegations."" She also denied Murphy's claim that O'Brien passed along instructions to limit reporting on Russia's election interference, stating that the national security advisor ""has never sought to dictate the Intelligence Community’s focus on threats to the integrity of our elections or on any other topic."" O'Brien called the allegations ""hearsay"" in a Fox News interview Wednesday. Murphy’s complaint is likely to fuel mounting concern from critics of the administration that the president and his appointees have sought to politicize the intelligence process to more closely support the administration’s legislative and political goals. “These allegations, while disturbing, are not surprising,” said John Cohen, a former senior Homeland Security official during the Obama administration. “There have been long-standing concerns amongst law enforcement and intelligence professionals that under the Trump Administration, intelligence that contradicts the political narrative of the White House is routinely ignored, distorted or blocked from release in order to justify Administration policies that had previously been viewed as unjustifiable,” Cohen added. A committee official noted that some of the events alleged in the complaint took place as the Trump administration sought to limit in-person election security briefings for House lawmakers. Last week, ABC News first reported on a draft intelligence bulletin warning of a Russian effort to spread disinformation about Joe Biden's mental health that was initially withheld by senior Homeland Security officials. In response to the original ABC News report, a spokesperson for DHS said the report was delayed because it did not meet the agency's standards. But in his complaint, Murphy claims that Wolf told him “the intelligence notification should be ‘held’ because it ‘made the President look bad.’” Last month, Murphy was removed from his post at the DHS intelligence branch and reassigned within the agency after reports emerged that his unit had gathered information about members of the press – a practice that experts said was out of the agency's purview and was alarming and ""disheartening."" Murphy claims in his complaint that this “de facto demotion” occurred shortly after he confronted Wolf and Cuccinelli with “concerns that he was being ordered to manipulate intelligence for political reasons.” Mark Zaid, an attorney for Murphy, released a statement on Wednesday claiming that his client “followed proper lawful whistleblower rules in reporting serious allegations of misconduct against DHS leadership, particularly involving political distortion of intelligence analysis and retaliation.” “We have alerted both the Executive and Legislative Branches of these allegations and we will appropriately cooperate with oversight investigations,” Zaid continued, “especially in a classified setting."" [Editor's Note: This report was updated Friday, Sept. 11, to clarify the allegations related to the southern border and to include new information from a ""clarification"" by Murphy's attorney regarding then-Secretary Nielsen's congressional testimony.

2020-09-08,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/russia-spreading-disinformation-bidens-mental-health-dhs/story?id=72879355,Russia spreading disinformation about Biden's mental health: DHS,"The Department of Homeland Security has found that Russia is spreading disinformation regarding former Vice President Joe Biden’s mental health, according to a DHS bulletin obtained by ABC News. ABC News previously reported that DHS withheld publication of an intelligence bulletin warning law enforcement agencies of a Russian scheme to promote “allegations about the poor mental health” of Biden. The draft bulletin, titled “Russia Likely to Denigrate Health of US Candidates to Influence 2020 Election,” was submitted to the agency’s legislative and public affairs office for review on July 7. The analysis was not meant for public consumption, but it was set to be distributed to federal, state and local law enforcement partners two days later, on July 9, the emails show. It was not -- and after an uproar in the media an updated version of the bulletin was released Tuesday, providing details on what the Russian operation looks like. Russian actors are spreading ""unsubstantiated allegations"" that former Biden is of ""ill-health,"" the DHS bulletin says, and speculates that ""this narrative will resonate with some American voters and reduce their confidence in him as a candidate."" ""Russia is using both covert proxy websites and overt state media to amplify these allegations, often in conjunction with other election-related malign influence narratives, which is consistent with their tactics in 2016 to undermine a former presidential candidate,"" it continues. The bulletin says the current effort has been ongoing since September 2019. ""Russian covert and covert influence actors posted negative commentary and unsubstantiated allegations about the poor mental health of Biden. For example, proxy websites have claimed that the candidates gaffes are symptoms of dementia, that he is mentally unfit for the presidency, and that he is unlikely to serve his full term due to his age,"" the bulletin reads. President Donald Trump's campaign has also maintained an effort to depict Biden, who turns 78 shortly after Election Day, as mentally unfit for office. One such example came in July, when the Trump campaign aired an ad in 12 states that questioned Biden’s fitness for office. ""Joe Biden is slipping,"" a narrator in the ad says. ""Now at the age of 77 years old and running for president for the third time, Biden is clearly diminished. Joe Biden does not have the strength, stamina and mental fortitude required to lead this country."" Last week on Fox News, DHS Acting Secretary Chad Wolf refuted critics quoted in the ABC story who characterized the initial bulletin as being withheld for political reasons, calling the story “inaccurate.” Instead, he said, the bulletin's release was delayed for quality control reasons. ""The report that you referenced was, at the end of the day, a very poorly written report. I had questions about it when I talked to career officials in I&A [Intelligence and Analysis] in the office that produced the report,” Wolf said. “They also had questions about it. They're hard at work on rewriting that report, putting it in better context. I hope to see that record out soon."" That updated bulletin also refers to China and Iran raising questions about Trump’s mental health but ""these efforts probably fall short of Russia’s more sustained, coordinated malign influence operations across multiple overt and covert platforms to undermine other US politicians"" it reads. The bulletin says DHS has “high confidence” in the assessment that was eventually released.",20,,,,24

The July notice from the DHS Office of Intelligence and Analysis, which warned of a Russian plan to promote ""allegations about the poor mental health"" of Biden, was never released to federal, state and local law enforcement, after a senior DHS official raised concerns about the bulletin over email, as ABC News first reported. House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., said the decision not to release the bulletin more widely this summer was ""alarming."" ""We need our intelligence agencies to speak truth to power, and if information is going to be withheld like this, it means they're not doing their job,"" Schiff said. In a statement to ABC News, a DHS spokesperson said that the draft report ""lacked the necessary context and evidence for broader dissemination"" beyond the DHS intelligence office that produced it. Schiff said his committee would investigate the episode as part of its ongoing inquiry into the Department of Homeland Security's intelligence agency's activities during protests in Portland, Oregon. ""This is now going to be an additional item of investigation: Is the Department of Homeland Security Intelligence Agency withholding information, is it being interfered with politically, because the president doesn't want to know the Russians are helping his campaign?"" he said. Analysts determined with ""high confidence"" that Russia would continue raising questions about the health of Biden to impact the 2020 election, according to the draft obtained by ABC News. The bulletin, titled ""Russia Likely to Denigrate Health of US Candidates to Influence 2020 Election,"" also mentioned Iranian and Chinese schemes to criticize President Donald Trump. House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., and Rep. Max Rose, D-N.Y., asked the DHS inspector general, the agency's independent watchdog, to investigate the matter. They wrote in a letter that it raised ""deeply troubling questions about political influence on the production and dissemination"" of agency intelligence products. In an appearance on Fox News, acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf confirmed that the bulletin was withheld, calling it ""a very poorly written report."" ""I had questions about it when I talked to career officials … in the office that produced the report. They also had questions about it,"" he said. ""They're hard at work on rewriting that report, putting it in better context. I hope to see that record out soon.""",20,,,,24

Analysts with the Department of Homeland Security’s intelligence branch issued the warning on Thursday to federal and state law enforcement partners after finding with “high confidence” that “Russian malign influence actors” have targeted the absentee voting process “by spreading disinformation” since at least March. “Russian state media and proxy websites in mid-August 2020 criticized the integrity of expanded and universal vote-by-mail, claiming ineligible voters could receive ballots due to out-of-date voter rolls, leaving a vast amount of ballots unaccounted for and vulnerable to tampering,” the bulletin notes. “These websites also alleged that vote-by-mail processes would overburden the U.S. Postal Service and local boards of election,” it continues, “delaying vote tabulation and creating more opportunities for fraud and error.” President Trump has long sought to undermine public confidence in the upcoming election with baseless warnings that mail-in-voting could lead to widespread voter fraud. With the ongoing coronavirus pandemic expected to keep many voters from casting their ballots in-person, more Americans than ever are expected to vote absentee. John Cohen, the former undersecretary for intelligence at DHS under President Barack Obama, said the parallel messages emanating from both the Trump campaign and Russian malign actors is “highly disturbing.” “This most recent DHS intelligence report along with other recent reporting by intelligence and law enforcement entities should put to rest any doubts that Russia is spreading conspiracy theories and lies in an effort to influence the outcome of the 2020 election by undermining confidence in the election process and influence voter opinion,” said Cohen, who is also an ABC News contributor. On Wednesday, ABC News first reported that senior DHS officials withheld a July bulletin from distribution that found that Russia would continue raising questions about the mental health of Biden to impact the 2020 election – a line of attack the president, 74, and his reelection campaign have also used against the former vice president, who will turn 78 shortly after Election Day. The July bulletin, titled ""Russia Likely to Denigrate Health of US Candidates to Influence 2020 Election,"" also mentioned Iranian and Chinese schemes to criticize President Donald Trump. Andrew Bates, a Biden campaign spokesperson, said Thursday, ""This is the second time in two days it has been revealed that Donald Trump and the Russian government are pushing the same malicious smear about the 2020 election."" He accused Trump and Russia of being ""aligned in assaulting"" democracy. Tim Murtaugh, a Trump campaign spokesperson, said in response to ABC News' original report, ""We don't need or want any foreign interference."" ""President Trump will beat Joe Biden fair and square,"" he said. In a statement to ABC News, a DHS spokesperson confirmed that the July product was ""delayed,"" explaining that it ""lacked the necessary context and evidence for broader dissemination."" After ABC News published its report, acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf also acknowledged that the bulletin was withheld, calling it “a very poorly written report” during an appearance on Fox News. Congressional Democrats have since pledged to investigate the episode as part of the House Intelligence Committee’s ongoing inquiry into the Department of Homeland Security's intelligence agency's activities during protests in Portland, Ore.",20,,,,22

""I find it really disturbing that the pattern that is becoming clearer and clearer, that actions that are vital to protecting this nation ... are just not occurring,"" Cohen, an ABC News contributor, told ABC News Political Director Rick Klein and Chief White House Correspondent Jonathan Karl on the ""Powerhouse Politics"" podcast. ""And it's not occurring,"" he continued, ""because intelligence professionals are afraid of angering the president or putting something out that's viewed as being inconsistent with their political narrative."" On Wednesday, ABC News reported that the Department of Homeland Security blocked publication of an internal bulletin meant to inform various state and federal law enforcement agencies of a Russian scheme to promote ""allegations about the poor mental health"" of Biden, according to internal emails and a draft of the document obtained by ABC News. The document mentions Iranian and Chinese efforts to criticize Trump, but focuses on -- and takes its title from -- Russia's attacks on Biden's mental fitness In a statement to ABC News, a DHS spokesperson confirmed that the product was ""delayed,"" explaining that it ""lacked the necessary context and evidence for broader dissemination."" News of the blocked bulletin, which Cohen called ""highly unusual,"" comes on the heels of a controversial decision by Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe, a loyal ally to President Donald Trump, to halt in-person election security briefings to congressional oversight committees. Cohen said these two developments risk ""undermining the ability of our government to protect against foreign interference."" ""If you are restricting in-person briefings at the same time you are blocking or altering intelligence products so that they either don't [upset] the president or they support the partisan political narrative or the campaign narrative, then there are rightful concerns that Congress isn't getting the whole picture,"" Cohen said. The president, who is 74, and his political operations have also taken aim at Biden's mental acuity, weaponizing the former vice president's age, 77, and repeatedly raising questions about his ""geriatric mental health."" In a statement to ABC News, a Biden campaign spokesperson accused the Trump campaign of ""speaking from the same script of smears and lies"" as the Kremlin. Regardless of the rationale for blocking the July bulletin, Cohen said the fact that the Trump campaign has engaged in a similar line of attack against Biden gives the impression intelligence is being ""altered or blocked for political considerations."" ""We're talking about foreign intelligence services planting conspiracy theories and lies into the public discourse to influence how people act on Election Day,"" he continued. ""The only way you can counteract that is by identifying those that [present] inaccurate information and notifying people. And that's what this bulletin was intended to do."" And with just two months until ballots are tallied, Cohen said the intelligence community should be doing more, not less, to inform lawmakers and the American public of efforts by ""Russia and other hostile foreign countries ... to influence the outcome of the election."" ""This isn't a time to be restricting information to anybody,"" he said.",20,,,,24
2020-09-02,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/dhs-withheld-july-intelligence-bulletin-calling-russian-attack/story?id=72747130,DHS withheld July intelligence bulletin calling out Russian attack on Biden’s mental health,"In early July the Department of Homeland Security withheld publication of an intelligence bulletin warning law enforcement agencies of a Russian scheme to promote “allegations about the poor mental health” of former Vice President Joe Biden, according to internal emails and a draft of the document obtained by ABC News. The draft bulletin, titled “Russia Likely to Denigrate Health of US Candidates to Influence 2020 Election,” was submitted to the agency’s legislative and public affairs office for review on July 7. The analysis was not meant for public consumption, but it was set to be distributed to federal, state and local law enforcement partners two days later, on July 9, the emails show. Just one hour after its submission, however, a senior DHS official intervened. “Please hold on sending this one out until you have a chance to speak to [acting Secretary of Homeland Security Chad Wolf],"" wrote DHS Chief of Staff John Gountanis, according to an email obtained by ABC News. That was nearly two months ago. But the bulletin was never circulated. In a statement to ABC News, a DHS spokesperson confirmed that the product was “delayed,” explaining that it failed to meet the agency’s standards. According to the draft bulletin, analysts determined with “high confidence” that “Russian malign influence actors are likely to continue denigrating presidential candidates through allegations of poor mental or physical health to influence the outcome of the 2020 election.” “High confidence means what it sounds like -- that they are highly confident that their assessment is accurate and they don’t use that language very often,” Elizabeth Neumann, a former assistant secretary of Homeland Security during the Trump administration, told ABC News. The document mentions Iranian and Chinese efforts to criticize Trump, but focuses on — and takes its title from — Russia’s attacks on Biden’s mental fitness. It is a line of attack also utilized by both President Donald Trump and his reelection campaign. Beyond warnings of Russia's purported activity, critics said the decision to withhold the document will fuel concern that the Trump administration has sought to politicize intelligence, particularly after an announcement over the weekend that senior intelligence leaders will cease congressional election security briefings due to alleged leaks from lawmakers, and will instead provide only written reports. “We are hearing concerns being raised publicly that, in this administration, intelligence community reporting is being modified or blocked for political reasons -- or to not anger the president,” said John Cohen, an ABC News contributor and the former undersecretary for intelligence at DHS under President Barack Obama. “By blocking information from being released that describes threats facing the nation,” Cohen continued, “it undermines the ability of the public and state and local authorities to work with the federal government to counteract the threat.” As an example of Russian efforts to raise doubts about Biden's mental acuity, the draft bulletin points to a March story on a Russian proxy website that ""refuted media claims that the candidate’s gaffes are a result of a stutter, instead arguing these verbal miscues are symptoms of dementia.” The DHS spokesperson said that while the agency “generally does not comment on leaked documents, this particular draft product lacked the necessary context and evidence for broader dissemination outside of the Department of Homeland Security’s Office of Intelligence and Analysis.” “After briefing the Acting Secretary and he asked questions,” the spokesperson continued, “[Office of Intelligence and Analysis] career leadership decided to delay the product for further review.” In a statement to ABC News regarding the DHS bulletin, Trump campaign spokesperson Tim Murtaugh said, “We don’t need or want any foreign interference.” “There’s no question that the President has been tougher on Russia than any president before him, imposing sanctions and expelling diplomats, in contrast to the Obama-Biden Administration, which choked in the face of Russian interference,” he said. “President Trump will beat Joe Biden fair and square.” The White House declined to comment. Biden camp accuses Trump of 'speaking from the same script' as Russia The Trump campaign’s effort to depict Biden, who turns 78 shortly after Election Day, as mentally unfit for office has emerged as a central tenet of its multi-million dollar strategy to paint Biden as a feeble puppet of the “radical left.” It dates back to 2018 when, at the annual Gridiron Club Dinner, Trump jabbed his future 2020 opponent: “There's talk about Joe Biden, Sleepy Joe, getting into the race … the guy who keeps making outrageous statements thinks he has a shot at being president?” And while Trump, himself 74, first tweeted the “Sleepy Joe” nickname in April of last year, he and his campaign increased attacks on the former vice president's mental state earlier this spring as Biden emerged as the presumptive Democratic nominee. Trump repeatedly targeted Biden in remarks and on Twitter while his campaign in May launched a Facebook ad blitz that raised questions about his ""geriatric mental health."" In June the Trump campaign ran a brutal television ad titled ""Fortitude"" that worked to paint a dire picture of Biden’s mental state. The next month -- around the time the DHS memo was submitted -- Trump said in a radio interview, ""[Biden's] record is terrible. He can't even talk about his record. He forgets his record, he forgets everything."" On Tuesday, the president said, ""Biden doesn't know he's alive."" In a statement to ABC News, Andrew Bates, a spokesperson for the Biden campaign, decried “the lengths to which Donald Trump will go to manipulate and conceal intelligence for partisan political purposes.” “He is blocking the intelligence community from sharing with federal and state law enforcement a crucial finding: that Russia is disseminating false and scurrilous attacks on the health of Joe Biden -- one that aligns with Trump's own constantly-backfiring attacks,” Bates added. “And why would he do this? Because Russia and the Trump campaign are speaking from the same script of smears and lies.” In the intelligence draft bulletin, analysts point out that Russia’s current line of attack targeting Biden’s health echoes its efforts in 2016 to “[raise] serious doubts about [then-candidate Hillary Clinton’s] physical capability,” particularly after she fell ill at a 9/11 memorial event in New York City. At the time, Trump and his surrogates leveled similar attacks against Clinton, calling into question her physical fitness for office. Weeks after the 9/11 memorial incident, Trump said during a debate that Clinton “doesn't have the stamina” to be president. Intel chief’s move to limit congressional briefings sparks outcry After months of warnings from law enforcement and the intelligence community of Moscow’s ongoing efforts to meddle in the November election, if it had been circulated, the July bulletin would have served as one of the most explicit and specific examples to date of Russia’s intentions. In August, the Office of Director of National Intelligence publicly reported “that Russia is using a range of measures to primarily denigrate” Biden, adding that “some Kremlin-linked actors are also seeking to boost President Trump’s candidacy on social media and Russian television.” Trump later disputed that finding, claiming that “the last person Russia wants to see in office is Donald Trump, because nobody’s been tougher on Russia than I have, ever.” On Saturday, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) announced it would halt in-person congressional briefings about election security, citing concern over ""unauthorized disclosures of sensitive information."" Newly minted Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe wrote to congressional leaders that ""this approach helps ensure… that the information ODNI provides the Congress … is not misunderstood nor politicized."" Democrats fired back, calling Ratcliffe’s decision “a shocking abdication of its lawful responsibility to keep the Congress currently informed, and a betrayal of the public's right to know how foreign powers are trying to subvert our democracy.” Acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf reacted Sunday on ABC News’ “This Week,” saying his agency will “continue to have in-person briefings with members of Congress and staff,” but defended Ratcliffe’s decision. In their statement to ABC News, the DHS spokesperson added that “[the DHS Office of Intelligence and Analysis] is committed to fulfilling its mission to keep the Homeland safe and secure, which included the sharing of three reports on election security in August 2020 with state and local partners.” On “This Week,” Wolf added that Russia, China, and Iran continue to engage in “disinformation campaigns to sow discourse within the U.S.” In the August statement from ODNI, intelligence officials concluded that “China prefers that President Trump – whom Beijing sees as unpredictable – does not win reelection.” Iran, it found, “seeks to undermine U.S. democratic institutions, President Trump, and to divide the country in advance of the 2020 elections.” In the July draft bulletin, in addition to reports of Russian interference, analysts said Iranian state media has “amplified public discussion by medical professionals alleging that [President Trump] suffered from psychosis and narcissistic personality disorder.” In China, state media outlets have “questioned [President Trump’s] health and suggested that a debate about the mental health of a U.S. president is indicative of deeper problems with democracy.” With just two months until ballots are tallied, Cohen said the safety and efficacy of our election depend on collaboration within the law enforcement community and transparency about malign foreign meddling. “One of the ways you counteract these threats,” Cohen said, “is by providing state and local authorities, political parties, and the general public access to information about both the methods being used to spread this disinformation and the contents of this disinformation campaign so people know, when they see this material, that it is inaccurate and is to be disregarded.” ABC News' Beatrice Peterson contributed reporting.",20,,,,24

The social media giant said it removed a ""small network"" of accounts and pages created by individuals it said were ""associated with"" the Internet Research Agency after receiving a tip from the FBI. The St. Petersburg-based group previously engaged in a coordinated online effort to influence the 2016 election, according to special counsel Robert Mueller's report on Russian interference. In this most recent action 13 accounts and two pages were removed for violating Facebook's policy on foreign interference, the company said. The effort was in its early days of development and was removed before it amassed a large audience, Facebook said. While it was still active on the site, the group created fake left-wing accounts ""to create elaborate fictitious personas, manage Pages, post in Groups and drive people to their off-platform site masquerading as an independent news outlet based primarily in Romania,"" the report said. These accounts ""operated across a number of internet services and used fake names and profile photos"" and ""posed as news editors from various countries, including the US,"" it continued. Facebook has periodically removed accounts it accused of inauthentic behavior linked to Russia and other foreign countries. About a dozen ""deceptive campaigns connected to individuals associated with the [Internet Research Agency]"" have been taken town since 2017, Facebook said. Twitter also announced on Tuesday that it had suspended five accounts linked to one of the same pages, Peacedata, which the company said could be ""reliably attribute[d] to Russian state actors."" After Facebook's announcement, the FBI said the bureau provided information on the network ""to better protect against threats to the nation's security and our democratic processes."" ""We consider strategic engagement with U.S. technology companies, which includes sharing threat indicators, to be critically important in combating malign foreign influence actors,"" the FBI statement said. ""While technology companies independently make decisions regarding the content of their platforms and the safety of their members, the FBI is actively engaged with our federal partners, election officials, and the private sector to mitigate foreign threats to our nation's security and our elections."" Concerns about Russian interference ahead of the 2020 election have been rising as the election draws closer. In February, FBI Director Christopher Wray warned the House Judiciary Committee that Russia was waging ""information warfare"" on social media to sow discord ahead of the 2020 election, though he said he had seen no direct evidence that they were attempting to target election infrastructure. In June, a pair of Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee expressed concern over foreign adversaries’ efforts to “exploit the current heightened tensions in America by spreading misinformation, inciting violence, or utilize any other means to support a foreign agenda not in the best interests of American national security, public health, and safety."" Then, last month, the U.S. intelligence community warned in a statement that Russia was ""using a range of measures to primarily denigrate former Vice President Biden and what it sees as an anti-Russia 'establishment.'"" ""Some Kremlin-linked actors are also seeking to boost President Trump's candidacy on social media and Russian television,"" it said. At the same time, the statement noted that China and Iran were working to undermine Trump. Russia has broadly denied allegations of interference in 2016. In 2018 the Justice Department brought charges against the Internet Research Agency and several other defendants linked to the alleged influence campaign, which allegedly included the use of fake social media accounts. The IRA did not respond to the charges, and in March the Justice Department dropped its case against another defendant, saying a securing a conviction against one of the defendants could expose law enforcement methods.",20,,,,22

Newly minted Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe informed a bipartisan group of congressional leadership and intelligence committee chairmen on Saturday that ""this approach helps ensure, to the maximum extent possible, that the information ODNI provides the Congress … is not misunderstood nor politicized."" ""In the last few months alone, the [intelligence community] … have provided Congress with more than a dozen briefings,"" Ratcliffe continued.

Adam Schiff, D-Calif., in a statement reacting to Ratcliffe's letter. In their statement, Schiff and Pelosi said the Office of the Director of National Intelligence had previously planned to brief the House and Senate intelligence Committees and full House in mid-September, before abruptly canceling those plans. President Donald Trump echoed that the briefings were being altered due to leaks. ""Director Ratcliffe brought information into the committee, and the information leaked,"" Trump told reporters Saturday following a tour of damage from Hurricane Laura in Texas. ""Whether it was 'Shifty Schiff' or somebody else, they leaked the information before it gets in. And what's even worse, they leaked the wrong information. And he got tired of it. So, he wants to do it in a different forum.""

""This situation we now face is due, in no small part, to the willingness of some to commit federal crimes for the purpose of advancing their electoral aims,"" Rubio continued. ""Yet, this grotesque criminal misconduct does not release the intelligence community from fulfilling its legal requirements to respond to Congressional oversight committees and to keep members of Congress fully informed of relevant information on a timely basis."" Rubio said briefings would continue on all oversight topics, including on election security, just not apparently in person. Even so, John Cohen, a former undersecretary for intelligence at the Department of Homeland Security and an ABC News contributor, said that ""by refusing to brief Congress on a significant threat facing this country, administration officials are placing this country at grave risk."" ""The House and Senate intelligence committees have a long history of receiving and protecting our nation's most sensitive secrets,"" Cohen continued. ""We've heard repeatedly over the past several years of the serious threat facing our nation from hostile foreign actors seeking to influence the outcome of the 2020 election."" Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., slammed the decision in a statement. ""DNI Ratcliffe has made clear he's in the job only to protect Trump from democracy, not democracy from Trump,"" he said.

""If they are unwilling to,"" the lawmakers warned, ""we will consider the full range of tools available to the House to compel compliance."" Former Vice President Joe Biden's campaign reacted to the ODNI's decision to cease in-person briefings on election security in a statement on Saturday, with campaign spokesman Andrew Bates calling the announcement ""deeply alarming,"" given Trump's ""unprecedented welcoming of these assaults on our democracy for his own gain,"" by countries like Russia, China and Ukraine.

A number of Florida students who planned to take the online bar exam in August 2020 claim there were attempts originating from Russia to gain access to sensitive accounts after they downloaded test software from ILG Technologies, and in some cases, they say their entire computers were wiped out after downloading the test administering software. ""There are now accounts emerging of examinees receiving emails from websites claiming that their information was used to log in or that a login attempt was detected from another country,” a number of students wrote in a letter. The letter, obtained by ABC News does not specify how many students signed on. Many of the Florida students who were set to take the bar said in an Aug. 10 letter sent to the Florida Board of Bar Examiners. Two days before the Florida bar exam was supposed to take place, on Aug. 20, the Florida Board of Bar Examiners cancelled it altogether, saying in a video that taking the exam online was not ""technically feasible,"" but not going into details. ""Our inability to offer the Bar examination in August was a failure. We apologize for that failure,"" Florida Supreme Court Chief Justice Charles Canady said in video released last week. ""We acknowledge and accept the criticism that has been directed at the court and the Board of Bar Examiners."" ILG Technologies is a Missouri-based company that specializes in administering both the online and in-person bar exam, with Illinois, Alabama and Texas among the states that use the software, according to the company's website. Their development office is based in Turkey, according to the website. ""There is no evidence linking any security breach with ILG Software,"" a representative for ILG told ABC News. ""We actually have had our software audited via third party software security firm, based in Miami, Florida and the report came back negative for any virus or malware."" The Florida State Supreme Court has not responded to ABC News' request for comment. Students were required to download the software four days before the exam, and quickly, their letter states, issues started to occur. ""Some have experienced a sudden influx of messages from foreign telephone numbers seeking Bitcoin, and many cannot access email accounts after their passwords were changed without their permission,"" the letter, which includes 28 pages detailing reported problems students faced, says. Shortly after signing up and downloading the software, one student, whose name was redacted for privacy, said they received a Gmail login attempt emanating from Russia.The letter also asserts that multiple students reported there were attempts to gain access to their Robinhood accounts, a platform for online investing. Some students said their bank accounts were accessed shortly after the software was downloaded. ""Examinees understand that their information could have been accessed from anywhere, but the co-occurrence of the ILG software download and these login attempts is disturbing when coupled with the lack of accountability from ILG,"" the students continued. ILG's user agreement says they're not responsible for any lost data or software. Screenshots obtained by ABC News show apparent failures in the system's artificial intelligence verification program, which is supposed to use photos to verify an ID or other form of identification. Students said the system was accepting any photo as a form of identification: In one instance, a user submitted an image of a dog, and another, a glass of what appears to be orange juice. The system approved both of those images, according to the letter. Fourteen states and jurisdictions are set to take the bar in October, according to the National Conference of Bar Examiners, and students ABC News spoke with worry they will not be able to adequately and fairly take that October exam due to technical difficulties. Issues have been plaguing law graduates attempting to take the bar across the nation. In Michigan and Nevada, for instance, software programs -- not run by ILG -- crashed mid-exam. ""I don't want to overly dramatize what happened but it caused a period of strong anxiety in the middle of a test day for myself and, I'm sure, for many other people,"" Kerry Martin, a University of Michigan law school graduate, told the Detroit News. ""I can't guarantee you that the path forward will be flawless, but I can guarantee you that we have learned from this mistake and that it will not be repeated,"" Florida Supreme Court Chief Justice Canady said in last week's video.",20,,,,12
2020-08-26,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/coordinated-national-voter-fraud-effort-major-election-fbi/story?id=72629577,'No coordinated national voter fraud effort during a major election': FBI,"The Federal Bureau of Investigation said Wednesday that it has not seen a ""coordinated national voter fraud effort during a major election."" ""We're fully aware that COVID-19 and the expectation of the increased mail-in ballots has created a new environment for this election cycle,"" a senior FBI official told reporters on a conference call. ""However, we have not seen to date a coordinated national voter fraud effort during a major election. It would be extraordinarily difficult to change a federal election outcome through this type of fraud alone, given the range of processes that we need to be affected or compromised by an adversary, at the local level."" President Donald Trump has repeatedly attacked mail-in voting, saying it will lead to fraud. ""With Universal Mail-In Voting (not Absentee Voting, which is good), 2020 will be the most INACCURATE & FRAUDULENT Election in history. It will be a great embarrassment to the USA. Delay the Election until people can properly, securely and safely vote???"" President Trump tweeted in July. A senior intelligence official said there has been no information or intelligence that any nation-state is engaging in activities to undermine any part of the mail-in vote or ballots. A senior Department of Homeland Security official said that the department's cyber arm, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, has worked with ""thousands"" of state and local governments to prepare for the 2020 presidential election. ""What we know is the target of election infrastructure is in the playbook,"" the senior DHS official told reporters. ""We saw it in 2016. We know it's an option now. We continue to receive reporting from state local election officials of scanning and probing of election infrastructure as a whole, which is what you'd expect to see ..."" The message from the FBI comes on the same day Deputy Attorney General Jeffery Rosen asked Americans to be vigilant about foreign influence in the upcoming election. ""Foreign propaganda and other influence activities have been concerns since the founding of our Republic, but they are challenges that we’ve been successfully navigating for more than two hundred years,"" Rosen said in prepared remarks. A separate FBI official reiterated that both Russia and China are trying to disrupt the U.S. election. The senior DHS official, however, said there is better information sharing among the states now than in 2016 and that the majority of the scanning that foreign countries do for ways to interfere has been “blocked” and is “unsuccessful.” DHS briefed local and state election security officials Wednesday afternoon on the threats that the U.S. is facing, the official said. Officials said that 45 days before the election, there will be more check-ins with state and local partners and more information sharing. As the U.S. gets closer to the election, those efforts will be ramped up, according to the DHS official. For example, DHS said it will have a virtual situation awareness room where election officials can log in to report issues in their particular jurisdictions, which would then be shared with state and local partners.",20,,,,22
2020-08-26,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/us-troops-injured-collision-russian-vehicle-syria/story?id=72626089,4 US troops injured after collision with Russian vehicle in Syria,"Four U.S. military personnel were injured Tuesday when their vehicle was side-swiped by a Russian military armored vehicle during a tense encounter with Russian troops in eastern Syria, according to a U.S. official. Multiple videos posted on social media showed a chaotic scene between American and Russian military vehicles and a Russian helicopter that hovered above a U.S. vehicle for an extended period. The incident occurred on Tuesday as a U.S. military patrol encountered a Russian military patrol in eastern Syria. ""At approximately 10 a.m. (Syria Time), Aug. 25, a routine Defeat-ISIS Coalition security patrol encountered a Russian military patrol near Dayrick, in northeast Syria,"" said John Ullyot, a spokesman for the National Security Council, in a statement. ""During this interaction, a Russian vehicle struck a Coalition Mine-Resistant Ambush Protected All-Terrain Vehicle (M-ATV) causing injuries to the vehicle’s crew."" A U.S. official said the collision occurred after the Russian vehicle carried out what was characterized as ""a reckless move."" The injuries to the U.S. service members were characterized as concussive-type injuries that were minor in nature, the U.S. official said. ""To de-escalate the situation, the Coalition patrol departed the area,"" said Ullyot. ""Unsafe and unprofessional actions like this represent a breach of de-confliction protocols, committed to by the United States and Russia in December 2019."" ""The Coalition and the United States do not seek escalation with any national military forces, but U.S. forces always retain the inherent right and obligation to defend themselves from hostile acts,"" the statement continued. In addition to the actions by the Russian military vehicles, Russian military helicopters in the vicinity also hovered above the tops of the American vehicles for some time, according to the U.S. official. Gen. Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, called Gen. Valery Gerasimov, the chief of the Russian General Staff by telephone on Wednesday to discuss the incident. ""In accordance with past practice, both have agreed to keep the specific details of their conversation private,"" said Col. DeDe Halfhill, the spokesperson for the Joint Chiefs of Staff. At least 500 American troops continue to operate in eastern Syria to help protect oil fields operated by Kurdish forces from ISIS. American troops come into almost daily contact with Russian military forces that operate in northern Syria, and U.S. officials say the large majority of those interactions are professional in nature. But the U.S. official said Tuesday's incident occurred ""clearly inside the eastern security zone that the Russians have agreed to stay out of."" A U.S. official confirmed that videos posted by Russian websites captured Tuesday's chaotic incident. One video appears to show an apparent collision between an American armored vehicle and a Russian armored vehicle. At one point, a Russian military helicopter hovered directly above a stationary American vehicle in an apparent attempt to make it move from its location",7,,,,6
2020-08-20,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/minuteman-iii-icbm-marks-50-years-service-week/story?id=72470959,Minuteman III ICBM marks 50 years of service this week,"It is a milestone that likely would have seemed unimaginable to the engineers that designed the Air Force's Minuteman III missile, but this week marks the 50th year of service for the intercontinental ballistic missile. Originally envisioned to be operational for 10 years, the missile could remain in service for at least another decade until it is eventually replaced by the next generation of ICBMs. The 400 Minuteman III's currently in service are the ground-based missile component of the U.S. military's nuclear triad that makes up the United State's nuclear deterrent. The nuclear triad also includes submarine-launched ICBMs and nuclear weapons delivered by long-range strategic bombers. When the missiles first went into service on Aug. 19, 1970, they served as a nuclear deterrent to the Soviet Union. In the decades since the end of the Cold War they have continued to play that role while Russia and China have modernized their own ICBM fleets. ""The missile was really only meant to be in the ground for 10 years, and so here we are at 50,"" Gen. Tim Ray, the commander of Air Force Global Strike Command, told ABC News. Over the years, multiple maintenance programs have extended the missile's service life far longer than could have been anticipated. ""There's a lot of great engineering that went into the missile, but not an extra 40 years worth,"" said Ray of a missile whose basic technology was designed in the 1960s. Ray praised the efforts of missile operators, maintainers and engineers who have enabled the life extensions of the last five decades. But those teams now face new challenges as spare parts needed to maintain the missiles have been harder to find as some of the original manufacturers of the Cold War-era missile have gone out of business. ""They've been tremendous 24-7, 365 for 50 years, and they've never faltered,"" said Ray. Reflecting on the success of the maintenance updates, the Air Force occasionally conducts Minuteman test launches from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California that strike remote targets at U.S. military ranges in the Pacific Ocean. ""This is a great story,"" said Ray. ""But just because it's a great story doesn't mean we have to try to recreate it for another 50 years. It's absolutely time to modernize a system."" The Air Force is already planning to replace the Minuteman with the next generation of ICBMs known as the Ground-Based Strategic Deterrent (GBSD), but the first of those missiles are not expected to be operational until the 2030s. Ray said the new missile will be cheaper to maintain because it will be designed to include modular technology and systems that can be updated over time as needed, instead of having to find specific parts for the Minuteman. Ray believes those changes and updated technologies will add up to billions in cost savings in the future. When those new missiles arrive a decade from now, they will go into the same underground missile silos that have housed Minuteman III's for the last 50 years. Those silos are spread out over tens of thousands of acres in North Dakota, Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, and Wyoming. Junior Air Force officers known as missileers pull continuous shifts at underground ""launch control centers"" that control the missile operations of multiple silos. The launch control centers are protected above ground by Air Force security teams that are also on continuous duty. But even these Air Force teams have had to a different kind of threat, the coronavirus pandemic. Regular testing has been implemented and schedules have been adjusted to reduce the physical contact for missileers, which Ray said had improved the quality of life for missile teams and their maintainers. But Ray said the isolated nature of operating the missile fleet has worked to their advantage during the pandemic because ""nothing says social distancing like 26,000 acres around you, it is a big, big help.""",49,,,,23
2020-08-07,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/china-working-trumps-reelection-russia-spreads-disinformation-biden/story?id=72241806,"Russia working to boost Trump's reelection and 'denigrate' Biden, as China undermines Trump: US intelligence","Three of America's top adversaries are actively meddling in U.S. presidential politics ahead of the November election, including efforts by Russia to advance President Donald Trump's reelection efforts, according to a public statement issued Friday by the U.S. intelligence community. ""We assess that Russia is using a range of measures to primarily denigrate former Vice President Biden and what it sees as an anti-Russia 'establishment,'"" the statement said, adding that, ""Some Kremlin-linked actors are also seeking to boost President Trump's candidacy on social media and Russian television."" Providing an example of Russia's influence measures, the statement noted that ""pro-Russia Ukrainian parliamentarian Andriy Derkach is spreading claims about corruption -- including through publicizing leaked phone calls -- to undermine former Vice President Biden's candidacy and the Democratic Party."" Last year, Derkach reportedly took part in a scheme to leak years-old calls between Biden and then-Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko. In December, as the House impeachment inquiry against Trump was underway, the president's personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, met with Derkach in Ukraine for a controversial film Giuliani was completing about Biden and his work in Ukraine as vice president. Derkach has claimed that he provided derogatory information about Biden to lawmakers on Capitol Hill, where Republicans are still pressing forward with at least one investigation into whether Biden's policies toward Ukraine were influenced by his son Hunter Biden, who served on the board of the Ukrainian energy company Burisma while Biden was still vice president. Biden has vehemently denied being influenced in any way, and several U.S. officials have -- under oath -- publicly described the allegations against Biden as not credible. Russia's latest efforts are ""consistent with Moscow's public criticism of [Biden] when he was Vice President for his role in the Obama Administration's policies on Ukraine and its support for the anti-Putin opposition inside Russia,"" said Friday's statement, which was issued by Trump appointee William Evanina, director of the United States National Counterintelligence and Security Center. It was just over two weeks ago that Biden said he was putting the Kremlin ""on notice"" over its election interference. ""If elected president, I will treat foreign interference in our election as an adversarial act that significantly affects the relationship between the United States and the interfering nation's government,"" Biden wrote as part of a lengthy statement. Evanina's statement also offered a new government assessment of efforts by China and Iran to influence the upcoming presidential election. ""We assess that China prefers that President Trump -- whom Beijing sees as unpredictable -- does not win reelection,"" the statement said. ""China has been expanding its influence efforts ahead of November 2020 to shape the policy environment in the United States, pressure political figures it views as opposed to China's interests, and deflect and counter criticism of China."" On Iran, Evanina's statement said the regime there is working against ""democratic institutions"" in general, but also looking to ""undermine"" Trump and ""to divide the country in advance of the 2020 elections."" ""Tehran's motivation to conduct such activities is, in part, driven by a perception that President Trump's reelection would result in a continuation of U.S. pressure on Iran in an effort to foment regime change,"" the statement concluded, predicting that Iran's influence efforts ""probably will focus on on-line influence, such as spreading disinformation on social media and recirculating anti-U.S. content."" As Election Day draws near, ""foreign states will continue to use covert and overt influence measures in their attempts to sway U.S. voters' preferences and perspectives, shift U.S. policies, increase discord in the United States, and undermine the American people's confidence in our democratic process,"" Evanina said. After Evanina issued his statement, the Department of Homeland Security's top cyber official, Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency Director Christopher Krebs, declared that such ""transparency"" and ""awareness"" are some of ""the best tools our election officials and the American people have to help defend against election interference."" ""We've come a long way since 2016,"" according to Krebs. In their own statement, Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Marco Rubio, R-Fla., and the top Democrat on the committee, Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., thanked Evanina for today's release of information, and they encouraged ""political leaders on all sides to refrain from weaponizing intelligence matters for political gain, as this only furthers the divisive aims of our adversaries."" ""Evanina's statement highlights some of the serious and ongoing threats to our election from China, Russia, and Iran,"" Rubio and Warner wrote. ""Everyone -- from the voting public, local officials, and members of Congress -- needs to be aware of these threats. And all of us should endeavor to prevent outside actors from being able to interfere in our elections, influence our politics, and undermine confidence in our democratic institutions.""

2020-07-24,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/foreign-adversaries-seeking-compromise-presidential-campaigns-election-infrastructure/story?id=71971674,"Foreign adversaries 'seeking to compromise' presidential campaigns, election infrastructure: Intel","The federal government’s counterintelligence chief marked 100 days until the 2020 presidential election with a troubling but expected status report: our foreign adversaries are at it again. Bill Evanina, the intelligence community’s director of the National Counterintelligence and Security Center, said Friday that, ""Today, we see our adversaries seeking to compromise the private communications of U.S. political campaigns, candidates and other political targets."" ""Our adversaries also seek to compromise our election infrastructure,"" he continued, ""and we continue to monitor malicious cyber actors trying to gain access to U.S. state and federal networks, including those responsible for managing elections."" In his lengthy statement, Evanina highlighted the work of China, Russia and Iran, but noted that ""other nation-states and non-state actors could also do harm to our electoral process."" The warning harkens back to the 2016 presidential campaign when Russian military intelligence operators engaged in a broadside bombardment of former secretary of state Hillary Clinton’s campaign and penetrated state election systems. Perhaps most notably, Evanina noted efforts to ""compromise the private communications"" of campaigns -- a startling echo of Russia’s actions in 2016 to hack and disseminate the private emails of John Podesta, at the time a senior campaign advisor to Clinton. Former special counsel Robert Mueller leveled indictments against a dozen Russian military intelligence officers for their role in the scheme. Friday’s warning from Evanina, who is tasked with briefing campaigns on foreign election meddling, comes days after former vice president Joe Biden released his own lengthy condemnation of the Russians, saying he is putting the Kremlin and other foreign governments ""on notice."" ""If elected president, I will treat foreign interference in our election as an adversarial act that significantly affects the relationship between the United States and the interfering nation's government,"" Biden wrote. Evanina expressed confidence in the federal government’s intelligence and law enforcement agencies to quell the impact of foreign actors' efforts. Appearing on cable news shortly after the statement was released, Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, cast doubt on Evanina’s confident posture and condemned the dearth of specific information provided. ""I don’t have that confidence at all,"" Schiff told MSNBC’s Andrea Mitchell. ""I have serious concerns about the statement that was just put out … in the warnings that are given, they are so generic, in some ways, as to be meaningless."" Schiff accused President Donald Trump of providing adversaries with fodder for their subversion by calling into question the viability of mail-in voting. ""The Russians will look for any divide they can to sow chaos in the United States,"" he added. ""And what better way to amplify false information about how millions of Americans cast their votes?"" Evanina concluded his statement by ""committing to update the American public and other key stakeholders on threats to the election and steps for mitigation.”",20,,,,22
2020-07-22,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/International/russia-convicts-historian-yuri-dmitriyev-uncovered-stalins-mass/story?id=71920035,Russia convicts historian Yuri Dmitriyev who uncovered Stalin's mass graves,"A Russian court sentenced a historian who helped uncover mass graves from Stalin's ""Great Terror"" campaign to 3 1/2 years in jail, on charges widely criticized by rights groups as fabricated and viewed as part of an effort by Russian authorities to whitewash dark chapters of the country's Soviet history. However, the historian, Yuri Dmitriyev, avoided what his supporters had feared would be a much longer prison term. Prosecutors had sought a 15-year jail sentence for Dmitriyev but the court's decision means that because of time already served, he will be released in November. Dmitriyev, 64, heads a local branch of Memorial, a human rights group that commemorates the victims of Soviet repression. He has faced criminal prosecution since 2016, when he was accused by police of taking pornographic photographs of his adopted underage daughter. A court in April 2018 acquitted Dmitriyev of the charges, but a higher court overturned the ruling and ordered further investigation. In 2018, police brought the case once again and added a fresh charge alleging he had violently sexually abused his daughter. Dmitriyev was arrested and placed in pre-trial detention. An expert witness told the court the photographs were not pornographic and that psychological evaluations have shown no evidence that Dmitriyev is a pedophile. Dmitriyev said he took the photos to document the girl's health in order to prove to child welfare officers she was well-cared for. International and Russian human rights groups have condemned the trial as an attempt to smear one of the country's most prominent researchers of mass graves of victims murdered under Joseph Stalin. On Wednesday, the court in the Karelia region where Dmitriyev lives, convicted him on the charge of violent sexual abuse, handing down the 3 1/2-year sentence. But it acquitted him on the original pornography charges. Dmitriyev's supporters expressed disgust at the court's decision but hailed it as a victory because he will be freed soon. ""The absolute groundlessness of the accusations was obvious from the very start. And such a sentence for such a grave accusation means one thing: that there is no evidence of Dmitriyev's real guilt,"" Memorial wrote in a statement. ""Nonetheless, these accusations have already taken more than three years of Yuri Dmitryev's freedom and crippled the fate of his adopted daughter,"" the statement continued. ""By today's standards this is as good as them acquitting him,"" Evgeny Roizman, a prominent opposition politician wrote on Twitter. Dmitriyev's case has attracted international criticism. Human Rights Watch has previously called the charges ""bogus."" In May, the British government said it was ""deeply concerned"" by his detention. Dmitriyev's prosecution has coincided with an effort to alter the history of the grave sites in his region, Karelia, which borders Finland. In the 1990s Dmitriyev and others discovered a number of mass graves linked to Stalin's Gulag prison system in Russia. One grave site in Sandarmokh contained the bodies of over 6,000 prisoners murdered by Soviet secret police during the ""Great Terror"" (also known as the ""Great Purge"") between 1937-38. But in recent years, there has been an effort by a state-backed group to suggest that the Sandarmokh graves also contain the bodies of Red Army prisoners of war executed by Finnish troops during World War II. The theory is being promoted by Russia's Military-Historical Society, an organization known for its nationalist outlook and whose members include many senior Russian government officials. In 2018, members of the organization dug in the graves and found 16 soldiers' corpses which they believe proves that Soviet secret police were not the only ones involved in killing at Sandarmokh. Critics say the effort is meant to muddy the waters around the graves and take focus away from the Stalinist mass killings. It comes against the backdrop of a wider campaign under president Vladimir Putin in the last several years to downplay the importance of Soviet crimes in Russian history and rehabilitate Stalin's image. Memorial has faced a series of dubious criminal investigations in recent years. Last year, Memorial activists in Perm, located in central Russia, were accused by police of ""illegal logging"" for cutting away brush around a cemetery where Lithuanians and Poles displaced under Stalin are buried. The organization, which also campaigns against present-day abuses, has also seen its offices raided and its members have faced intimidation.",45,,,,3

Li Xiaoyu and Dong Jiazhi, both Chinese nationals currently living in China, are alleged in the indictment to be active leaders of a hacking campaign that has been ongoing for more than 10 years and has targeted hundreds of companies in more than 11 countries, including the U.S. ""The defendants stole hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of trade secrets, intellectual property, and other valuable business information,"" said Tuesday's unsealed indictment. Their primary goal, according to federal prosecutors, was not only personal financial gain but to hand over stolen data and hacked information to China's Ministry of State Security and other Chinese government agencies. ""The hackers stole terabytes of data which comprised a sophisticated and prolific threat to U.S. networks,"" the DOJ said in a press release. ""More recently, the defendants probed for vulnerabilities in computer networks of companies developing COVID-19 vaccines, testing technology, and treatments."" ""In this manner, China has now taken its place, alongside Russia, Iran, and North Korea, in that shameful club of nations that provide a safe haven for cyber criminals in exchange for those criminals being 'on call' to work for the benefit of the state, here to feed the Chinese Communist Party’s insatiable hunger for American and other non-Chinese companies' hard-earned intellectual property, including COVID-19 research,"" Assistant Attorney General John Demers said in a news conference Tuesday. While the Justice Department said at least four American companies working on coronavirus treatment and testing were targeted by Xiaoyu and Jiazhi, the indictment from the U.S. attorneys office in Spokane, Washington, does not allege the two hackers successfully accessed any firms' networks or data and stole COVID-related research. According to the indictment, Xiaoyu and Jiazhi were allegedly able to steal information ""regarding military satellite programs; military wireless networks and communications systems; high-powered microwave and laser systems; a counter-chemical weapons system; and ship-to-helicopter integration systems."" And their alleged activity on behalf of the Chinese Communist Party's government, according to the Justice Department, was not limited simply to stealing intellectual property. The indictment states that Xiaoyu and Jiazhi also provided China's Ministry of State Security with the personal data of Chinese dissidents and other critics of the government. Specifically, Xiaoyu and Jiazhi were able compromise the email accounts and passwords of a Hong Kong community organizer, a pastor of a Christian church in Xi'an, China, and a dissident and former Tianenmen Square protester, according to the indictment. They additionally stole emails from a Chinese Christian pastor in Chengdu just days after his church was banned by the government -- and the Justice Department says the pastor was subsequently arrested. While the FBI on Tuesday issued a wanted bulletin for both men and identified them as fugitives, it's unlikely that Xiaoyu and Jiazhi will ever see the inside of a U.S. courtroom. Law enforcement officials at Tuesday's press conference said the indictment primarily serves to publicly identify the two hackers, whose efforts were not previously being tracked, as a threat to the private sector in addition to raising broader awareness regarding malicious cyber activity being carried out by China. In May, the FBI issued its first public warning that Chinese government hackers were seeking to steal data from firms conducting COVID-19 research and testing. A DOJ official confirmed Tuesday's indictment contains the first publicly announced charges against Chinese nationals attempting to do so.",20,,,,18
2020-07-21,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/International/russian-influence-uk-normal-widely-anticipated-report-claims/story?id=71892151,"Russian influence in the UK is the 'new normal,' widely anticipated report claims","LONDON -- A highly-anticipated report by the U.K. Parliament into Russian interference in the country was released on Tuesday, claiming that Russian influence in the U.K. is the “new normal.” The Russia Report, published after months of delay, is the culmination of two years of fact finding by the U.K. Parliament’s Intelligence and Security Committee (ICS), providing insights on the Salisbury Novichok poisonings, Russian financial influence and social media disinformation. The report said the U.K. was a ""top target"" for Russian interference. The publication of the report comes a week after security services in the U.S., U.K. and Canada said that Russian hackers had been attempting to hack into global coronavirus vaccine research. The Kremlin has denied the accusations. However, the report will likely disappoint observers who expected the ICS to detail how far Russia interfered in the bitterly contested Brexit Referendum of 2016. Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s was accused of withholding the publication of the report until after the election of December 2019, a claim they denied. The Russia Report claims the security threat to Western countries posed by Russia is particularly difficult to manage as their aims are “fundamentally nihilistic.” “Russia seems to see foreign policy as a zero-sum game: any actions it can take which damage the West are fundamentally good for Russia,” the Report said. Overall, the ICS assessed Russia’s long term aim as to be seen as a “great power,” reach a level of global influence similar to the former Soviet Union, and preserve the current structure of leadership. As the result of a recent referendum, the Russian constitution was changed to give President Putin the right to potentially remain in power until 2036. The Russia Report described Russian interference in the U.K. as “the new normal,” particularly on a financial level. Many Russians with close links to Vladimir Putin have been accepted into the country because of their wealth, and integrated into the “business and social scene.” “This level of integration – in ‘Londongrad’ in particular – means that any measures now being taken by the Government are not preventative but rather constitute damage limitation,” the Report said. With British governments having welcomed Russian oligarchs and their money, many have connections at the “highest levels” of British politics. An industry of lawyers, accountants and estate agents help enable this influence, it added. On combatting the widely-reported ways in which Russian state-linked groups have used social media to spread disinformation, the Report said: “it is the social media companies which hold the key and yet are failing to play their part.” Russia’s cyber capability is a matter of “grave concern,” it added. The ICS said they had produced a shorter report than usual the case so as not share underlying details that could be analysed by the Russian Intelligence Services. In a line critical of the response of British security services to counter Russian meddling, the ICS said: “was not immediately apparent how these various agencies and organisations are co-ordinated and indeed complement each other.” The Report concludes that new legislation in required to deal with Russian interference, as well as a stronger and better co-ordinated response from the international community and among British security bodies. ""We’ve been clear that Russia must desist from its attacks on the UK & our allies,"" the Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab tweeted after the report was published.

2020-07-21,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/biden-warns-foreign-interference-us-elections-putting-kremlin/story?id=71886014,Biden warns against foreign interference in US elections: 'I am putting the Kremlin and other foreign governments on notice',"Former Vice President Joe Biden on Monday issued a stern warning against foreign interference in U.S. elections, singling out Russia and promising swift retaliation against any nation that attempts to meddle in the American democratic process. In a lengthy statement, the presumptive Democratic nominee lambasted the Trump administration for failing to take action to prevent foreign election interference, and said that he is putting the Kremlin and other foreign governments ""on notice,"" as a matchup with President Donald Trump looms just over 100 days away. ""If elected president, I will treat foreign interference in our election as an adversarial act that significantly affects the relationship between the United States and the interfering nation's government,"" Biden wrote. ""I will direct the U.S. Intelligence Community to report publicly and in a timely manner on any efforts by foreign governments that have interfered, or attempted to interfere, with U.S. elections. I will direct my administration to leverage all appropriate instruments of national power and make full use of my executive authority to impose substantial and lasting costs on state perpetrators,"" he added, noting that the potential costs could include ""financial-sector sanctions, asset freezes, cyber responses, and the exposure of corruption."" The statement aimed at Russia and other foreign governments comes just days after Biden revealed that he has been briefed by a team of experts on the topic of foreign election interference. ""We know from before and I guarantee you I know now because now I get briefings again. The Russians are still engaged in trying to delegitimize our electoral process. Fact,"" Biden said Friday evening at a virtual fundraiser hosted by a group of top lawyers. ""China and others are engaged as well in activities that are designed for us to lose confidence in the outcome,"" the former vice president, who served for multiple stints as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee during his 36-year career in the U.S. Senate, added. In his statement issued on Monday, Biden wrote that he has ""no desire"" to escalate tensions between the U.S. and Russia, or any other country, and would prefer to work together with the nations of the world to fight the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, but warned that he would impose punishments on any nation that interferes in American democracy. ""(I)f any foreign power recklessly chooses to interfere in our democracy, I will not hesitate to respond as president to impose substantial and lasting costs,"" Biden wrote. Since his election in 2016 over former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Trump has largely rejected the conclusion of the U.S. intelligence community that Russia interfered in the election to aid his candidacy, and said at a 2018 press conference along Russian President Vladimir Putin that he believes his denials that his country was involved in election meddling. ""My people came to me, (Director of National Intelligence) Dan Coats came to me and some others and said they think it's Russia. I have President Putin. He just said it's not Russia. I will say this. I don't see any reason why it would be (Russia),"" Trump said at the time. Throughout the 2020 campaign, Biden has sought to cast Trump as soft on Russia, and recently excoriated the president over reports that Russian intelligence officers offered to pay Taliban militants to kill American troops in Afghanistan over the past year. ""(Trump) has cozied up to Putin from the very beginning, giving Putin a standing that he does not deserve, undercutting our alliances in Europe and other parts of the world,"" Biden said during a virtual fundraiser in late June. ""When I'm president, this and so many abuses will not stand. Make no mistake. I'll confront Putin. I'll strengthen NATO. I'll make clear to Putin that they'll have a price to pay for interference in our democratic processes,"" Biden said. Trump has insisted he was never briefed on any alleged Russian bounty program, and the White House has maintained that the information regarding the program was not verified by U.S. intelligence agencies. ""I was never briefed because any info that they may have had did not rise to that level,"" Trump tweeted on July 1.",20,,,,4
2020-07-17,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/increase-mail-ballots-due-covid-created-greater-election/story?id=71851931,"Increase in mail-in ballots due to COVID has created greater election integrity, government official says","The integrity of the 2020 election may be improved as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, according to a leading cybersecurity expert. Christopher Krebs, director of the Department of Homeland Security's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, said Friday an increased reliance on mail-in and absentee ballots, which have a paper record associated with them, may be a blessing in disguise. Paper records, he said, are critical to election security because they lead to auditability. ""Auditability is a key element of being able to determine the integrity of a vote,"" Krebs said. ""To roll it back, make sure you got the right results, and, more than anything proving, through a post-election audit process, that the votes cast are counted as cast."" Krebs spoke as part of an online forum on election security hosted by the Brookings Institution, a think-tank based in Washington, D.C. He said that in the 2016 election, around 82% of votes cast had a paper record associated with them. Looking ahead to Nov. 4, he said that figure may be over 92% due to the expected increase in COVID-related absentee ballots. ""Again, the ability to conduct post-election audits is critical to establishing the integrity of the election,"" he added. President Donald Trump has routinely panned mail-in voting in recent weeks, claiming it will increase voter fraud without providing much evidence. ""You'll have tremendous fraud if you do these mail-in ballots,"" Trump said in a Rose Garden press conference Tuesday. ""Now, absentee ballots are OK, because absentee ballots, you have to get applications, you have to go through a process."" Election officials across the U.S. interviewed by ABC News have disagreed with mail-in ballots being a risk to election integrity. Krebs said CISA has taken a number of measures to improve the ""cyber hygiene"" of election databases, including ensuring that every single state election network has intrusion-detection sensors. He said all 67 counties in Florida were equipped with these sensors. ""We have the best comprehensive visibility across the election infrastructure sector than any other sector, so if there is a tremor out there in the force, we will feel it and we can act on it,"" he added. Krebs said that compared to where things were in 2016, ""we are not seeing that level of coordinated determined cyber activity from adversaries."" Notwithstanding that, he added, ""We are not fooling ourselves here -- there are bad guys that want to do bad things."" ""Russia wants to destabilize, China wants a more compliant state and Iran probably wants a little bit of both, so we are going to be prepared. We have got the defenses up, and we are ready for it,"" he said. Fiona Hill, the former National Security Council official who testified at the Trump impeachment hearings, moderated the panel in which Krebs spoke. Hill emphasized that low turnout was also a threat to election integrity and that voting was a privilege afforded to every American citizen. ""This is the fundamental act of agency that we all have as citizens in the U.S.,"" she said. ""Everybody should really get out there and vote and do their part.""",20,,,,22
2020-07-16,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/International/russia-linked-hackers-accused-stealing-covid-vaccine-data/story?id=71819152,What to know about the Russia-linked hackers accused of stealing COVID vaccine data,"The Russian hacking group accused on Thursday by the U.K., U.S. and Canada of seeking to steal information on potential COVID-19 vaccines is a familiar name to cybersecurity experts. APT-29, or Advanced Persistent Threat 29, is better known to many as ""Cozy Bear."" It's one of two hacking groups cybersecurity researchers have long linked to Russia's intelligence services and which has been accused of playing a prominent role in interfering with U.S. elections in 2016. Cybersecurity researchers have suggested the group is directed by Russia's domestic intelligence service, the FSB, though more recently they have come to believe its belongs to Russia's foreign intelligence service, the SVR. Also referred to as ""The Dukes,"" APT-29 is known for trying to steal intelligence from think tanks, political groups and activists. ""Cozy Bear"" gained notoriety in the U.S. after allegedly helping hack into the Democratic National Committee's computers. In 2016, the group was accused of breaking into the DNC's servers alongside a second hacking group -- APT-28, aka ""Fancy Bear"" -- that researchers and U.S. intelligence services have linked to the GRU, Russia's military intelligence agency. APT-28 was accused of playing the more significant role, stealing DNC emails and data and then dumping it online to harm the Democratic party. The Department of Justice in 2018 indicted 12 GRU officers over that operation. ""Cozy Bear"" by contrast was described by researchers as quieter and more discreet. The two hacking groups duplicating some of each other's efforts suggests they were unaware of each other's operations, the cybersecurity firm Crowdstrike said at the time. In 2018, Dutch media reported that the Netherlands' intelligence service, the AIVD, had successfully managed to break into the computers used by APT29, locating them in a university building close to the Red Square in Moscow. Hackers from the AIVD's Joint Sigint Cyber Unit reportedly had compromised the group since 2014, allowing them to watch in real time as they carried out attacks, including those involving the 2016 U.S. election. The Dutch hackers reportedly even managed to access a CCTV camera overlooking the building, allowing them to identify those inside. Dutch intelligence shared the information with the FBI and the National Security Agency. The Dutch reportedly concluded APT-29 was most likely linked to the SVR. In 2017, Norwegian police said ""Cozy Bear"" targeted several government ministries and the country's left-wing Labour party. The same year, the Dutch government ordered votes in Holland's general election to be counted by hand after Dutch intelligence said the Russian hackers had targeted ministries. The Slovakian cybersecurity firm ESET in October 2019 said it uncovered another years-long campaign by APT-29 that targeted at least three European foreign ministries. APT-29 is known for using spear-phishing campaigns, which attempt to trick email users into clicking on infected links that deliver malware onto that person's machine, which is overtaken by the hackers who can steal data as well as login credentials. A report into the election hack by the Department of Homeland Security and the FBI in December 2016 found that APT-29 had run a spear-fishing campaign in the summer 2015 that included more than 1,000 recipients, including U.S. government targets. The group's tactics apparently have become more sophisticated in recent years, developing methods designed to trick even some of the most careful targets, researchers have found. APT-29's target list has been found to coincide with those who would be of interest to Russia's government -- intelligence useful in foreign policy or for targeting critics.",20,,,,5

The U.S. National Security Agency agreed with that report. ""Throughout 2020, APT29 has targeted various organizations involved in COVID-19 vaccine development in Canada, the United States and the United Kingdom, highly likely with the intention of stealing information and intellectual property relating to the development and testing of COVID-19 vaccines,"" the NCSC report said. APT29, also known as ""the Dukes"" or ""Cozy Bear,"" is one of the Russian Intelligence Service entities identified in the FBI's assessment of malicious cyber activity in the 2016 presidential election. ""It is completely unacceptable that the Russian Intelligence Services are targeting those working to combat the coronavirus pandemic,"" Dominic Raab, the U.K.'s foreign secretary, said in response to the advisory. ""While others pursue their selfish interests with reckless behavior, the U.K. and its allies are getting on with the hard work of finding a vaccine and protecting global health."" He added, ""The U.K. will continue to counter those conducting such cyber attacks and work with our allies to hold perpetrators to account."" The NCSC's advisory lays out indicators of compromise and detection rules for companies involved in vaccine research, and warns that APT29 ""is likely to continue to target organizations involved in COVID-19 vaccine research and development, as they seek to answer additional intelligence questions relating to the pandemic."" Anne Neuberger, NSA's cybersecurity director, said the report would help to encourage everyone to ""take this threat seriously."" ""The National Security Agency (NSA), along with our partners, remains steadfast in its commitment to protecting national security by collectively issuing this critical cybersecurity advisory as foreign actors continue to take advantage of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic,"" Neuberger said in a statement to ABC News. ""APT29 has a long history of targeting governmental, diplomatic, think-tank, healthcare and energy organizations for intelligence gain so we encourage everyone to take this threat seriously and apply the mitigations issued in the advisory.” In May, the FBI and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency said Chinese-affiliated “cyber actors and nontraditional collectors” were attempting to steal research related to COVID-19 vaccines and treatment. ""The potential theft of this information jeopardizes the delivery of secure, effective and efficient treatment options,"" the Department of Homeland Security said in a statement. ""Russia’s efforts to steal information regarding COVID-19 vaccine development is part of an ongoing pattern of behavior by hostile foreign intelligence services to use cyberattacks as a means to gather sensitive information and even conduct covert attacks,"" ABC News' national security contributor John Cohen said. ""The growing use of these techniques by countries like Russia, China, North Korea and Iran represent a significant national security threat to the U.S. and other western nations.""

Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said Thursday that the intelligence on the Russian bounty program had not been corroborated by intelligence agencies and that they do not believe any attacks in Afghanistan that resulted in American casualties can be directly tied to it. The U.S. is still looking into the program and Milley warned that if it proves to have been real the U.S. ""will take action."" ""All the defense intelligence agencies have been unable to corroborate that report,"" Esper told the House Armed Services Committee. ""As of today, right now, we don't have cause and effect linkages to a Russian bounty program causing U.S. Military casualties,"" Milley said. ""However, we are still looking. We're not done. We're going to run this thing to ground."" If proven true, Milley said ""we will take action."" Though he also indicated that there have probably been some contacts with Russia about this, on the strategic level, that have not been made public. ""If it is bounties, I am outraged, just like every one of us in uniform is,"" Milley said. ""If these bounties are directed by the government of Russia to kill American soldiers, that is a big deal. We don't have that level of fidelity yet. We are still looking."" Gen. Kenneth McKenzie, the commander of U.S. Central Command, and Gen. Scott Miller, the top U.S. military commander in Afghanistan, became aware of the intelligence in January, according to Esper. ""Neither thought the reports were credible as they dug into them,"" said Esper, who noted that he became aware of the intelligence report in February. Esper added that McKenzie and DOD intelligence agencies have not found any links to an April 2019 roadside bomb blast that killed three Marines that, according to some press reports, has been linked to the program. Earlier this week, McKenzie said he found the intelligence report concerning, but did not believe it was tied to actual U.S. military deaths on the battlefield. ""I found it very worrisome, I just didn't find that there was a causative link there,"" McKenzie said in an interview with a small group of reporters. ""The intel case wasn't proved to me -- it wasn't proved enough that I'd take it to a court of law -- and you know that's often true in battlefield intelligence,"" McKenzie said. The general added that he told his intelligence staffers ""to continue to dig on it"" and that force protection levels for U.S. troops in Afghanistan are always high. Based on his multiple tours of service in Afghanistan, Milley said he has been aware of Russian meddling in Afghanistan for years, including sending arms supplies to the Taliban. But, he said, ""there is a distinction between arming and directing."" ""We don't have -- in the case of the Russians -- we do not have concrete evidence intelligence to show directing. That is a big difference,"" Milley said. ""If we did, it would be a different response. We are not done looking. We are going to get to the bottom of this bounty thing."" The reports of a Russian bounty program created a controversy for the Trump administration after it was disclosed that President Trump had not been personally briefed on the information because it had not been ""verified."" The Associated Press and the New York Times reported that the information was included in the written version of the president's daily intelligence brief in late February. Democratic members of Congress have countered that he should have been briefed regardless of whether the intelligence was fully analyzed, given that it involved the safety of American troops. Asked specifically at today's hearing if he had received a briefing that included the word ""bounty,"" Esper replied, ""To the best of my recollection, I have not received a briefing that included the word 'bounty.'"" If ""it was a credible report that used those words, certainly it would have been brought to my attention by the chain of command, by the chairman of the joint chiefs and others for action,"" Esper said. ""We would have taken upon that action in an interagency effort to make sure we addressed it,"" he added. ""At all times, we take force protection seriously and we take all of his actions regardless of the credibility of a report. We take all that seriously.""",20,,,,16
2020-07-03,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/presidents-daily-briefing-top-secret-intelligence-document-put/story?id=71578830,'The President's Daily Briefing': How the top secret intelligence document is put together,"Recent controversy over what President Donald Trump knew about U.S. intelligence has shed new light on how he -- or any president -- is briefed on top-secret information. A military official has confirmed to ABC News that Russian intelligence officers offered to pay Taliban militants to kill American troops in Afghanistan over the past year, amid peace talks to end the 18-year war there. Outraged members of Congress have been demanding answers about who knew what and when, and more important, was President Donald Trump briefed and if not, why. The White House has denied a New York Times report the president was briefed in writing on the intelligence. The president's aides argue it was unverified and while they specifically say he wasn't told verbally, they have been vague about whether it was presented to him in written form, in what's called the President's Daily Brief. Instead, administration officials have turned their ire toward leaks. ""When developing intelligence assessments, initial tactical reports often require additional collection and validation. In general, preliminary Force Protection information is shared throughout the national security community—and with U.S. allies—as part of our ongoing efforts to ensure the safety of coalition forces overseas,"" CIA Director Gina Haspel said in a statement. ""Leaks compromise and disrupt the critical interagency work to collect, assess, and ascribe culpability."" Four former senior intelligence officials previously involved in assembling the ""PDB"" described to ABC News the delicate business of briefing a president and how the top-secret document is put together six days a week. What is the Presidential Daily Brief? Former Secretary of Defense and CIA Director under President Barack Obama, Leon Panetta, calls it ""incredibly important."" ""It's not a good way to start your day,"" Panetta told ABC News. ""It can put a lot of worry into your head, by virtue of just reading about all the potential threats that the country is facing."" Perhaps the most famous PDB is the one made public by the 9/11 Commission in 2004. It's title: ""Bin Ladin Determined To Strike In US."" The intelligence was shared with the then-President George W. Bush on Aug. 6, 2001, more than a month before the hijackers carried out the 9/11 attacks. While it is rare for the public to see a PDB, the origins can be traced back to President John F. Kennedy, who wanted to be kept abreast on issues both foreign and domestic. Bruce Riedel, a former national security official, told ABC News that even today, the PDB has the same goal it did in the 1960s. ""In the Kennedy administration it was called the President's intelligence checklist, or pickle,"" Riedel, now a senior fellow and director of the Brookings Intelligence Project, told ABC News. ""It's purpose is really the same as it was back in the Kennedy administration -- to give the president a fairly short and concise summary of the most important intelligence."" He said the staff responsible for the PDB started out small, but now intelligence officers work around the clock to prepare the document. Stephen B. Slick, a former CIA operations officer and member of the National Security Council, told ABC News that the PDB has only one person in mind. ""It is simply a brief compilation of the most important intelligence information and analysis that the IC believes should be shared with the president,"" Slick, now the director of the Intelligence Studies Project at the University of Texas at Austin, said. ""[Intelligence Community] agencies produce hundreds of reports and analytic products each day for customers across the U.S. national security establishment. The PDB is typically the pick of that crop prepared for the 'First Customer,' he said. Slick said that the PDB is ultimately the responsibility of the director of National Intelligence, but that it is full of CIA information, ""which drafts and coordinates most of the articles that run."" Javed Ali, a former national security official and member of the National Security Council, said that the PDB is supposed to bring together all the information available to top officials. “Theoretically the PDB is supposed to be a cross-functional product,” Ali, a visiting professor at the University of Michigan, said. “It fuses different perspectives and intelligence reporting, and shouldn't just be one agency constantly informing the most senior officials about what's happening in the world.” Each president is different, Slick stressed, and every president has his own style and manner in which they prefer to be briefed. ""JFK wanted a card to stick in his shirt pocket,"" Slick said, while Richard Nixon relied on Henry Kissinger to brief him, and ""Obama received his PDB on a tablet computer."" Riedel said that ""about a dozen or so"" officials normally would see the PDB, from the vice president to the president's national security adviser to the White House chief of staff. The PDB is put together by analysts who have specific expertise on various world issues or events, but determining what actually makes it into the PDB and what the president sees on a daily basis, is a challenge for intelligence officials. Ali told ABC News that the threshold for what appears in the PDB is high and is often aligned to issues of interest to senior policymakers, while also leaving flexibility for topics identified at the ""bottom-up"" level or on late-breaking developments. Riedel echoed that view, saying there are multiple levels -- from supervisors to the director of National intelligence -- that analysis goes through before being placed in the president's briefing book. ""It can be a process that takes a long time,"" he said. Slick explained that what ends up in the actual briefing book can be wide-ranging. ""PDB ""articles"" can originate with the [intelligence community] based on new reporting or recently completed analysis that they believe merits the president's attention. Or, a PDB item can be a response to a question by the president, a senior principal or linked to a meeting, trip or decision he will shortly be required to make,"" he explained. A personal briefing In addition to a physical copy of the PDB, which Panetta said varies in page length based on the day and the intelligence, officials get an in-person briefer to answer their questions. ""A briefer will come in from the CIA and summarize the key elements of the PDB, respond to questions and if there are questions that the briefer doesn't know the answer to will usually come back with additional information,"" Panetta said. Riedel said that when the president is briefed, the CIA director and director of National Intelligence are usually in the room. In the Trump White House, Riedel said when now-Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was CIA director, he knew how to get through to the president. ""My understanding is that Mike Pompeo was very good at this, when he was director. He understood how to read the president's mood, and understood how you could get information that the president would absorb, Not all the time. He had a pretty good track record on it,"" he explained, adding he has ""no idea how it works in the current environment."" Not only is briefing the president ""very demanding,"" Riedel said, but the president also serves as ""your number one feedback. And if it's going right, the president and CIA analysts are more or less engaged in a dialogue."" Because former President Bill Clinton stayed up until all hours of the night, he'd receive the briefing in writing to start off with and would write questions in the margins of the PDB, Riedel said. ""First of all, someone would have to read his handwriting and make sense out of it, and then figure out what is this question about."" Bringing information to the president's attention Panetta stressed any vital information about major adversaries such as Russia and China is always in the briefing book. ""Well, there's obviously a lot of judgment involved in what you're going to highlight, but I don't think there's any question that if there is intelligence in there that involves something serious involving our adversary that that would be highlighted,"" he said. Panetta said that any intelligence, even not fully verified, about the Russians offering the Taliban a bounty on American soldiers would ""absolutely"" be something that the president should know about. ""Are you kidding me?"" Panetta said. ""The lives of our men and women in uniform, and they're being targeted and they're being killed, with a price under a head? There's just no question."" Panetta added that he would be ""very surprised"" if intelligence analysts didn't do their job. Slick explained that the president might not have taken note and ""the fact that IC experts may not have reached full consensus on the facts or implications of these reports would not keep it out of what he calls ""the book."" Slick said that while it is fair to look at the actions of the president, Americans should also focus on the people around him. ""The national security adviser and secretary of defense in particular should have been laser-focused on this issue and keeping the president informed and supported,"" he said. ""Any minimally competent national security adviser or chief of staff would sense the tactical, strategic and political implications of reports like this … and also should have foreseen that it would leak and generate controversy."" Ali said, in theory, someone else could have seen and acted on the same information. “The DNI should have seen it. Other very senior customers who also get the PDB could have seen it and even started a process to bring the government together to confront that even if it didn't get to the President's attention.” Panetta said that he doesn't know any intelligence official who wouldn't ""speak truth to power when it comes to critical intelligence."" If they didn't brief the president on this matter, he added, ""that's unacceptable.""",20,,,,16

Following a briefing for the so-called ""Gang of Eight"" -- party leaders including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, as well as the chairmen and ranking members of the House and Senate Intelligence Committees -- Pelosi said President Donald Trump “should have been verbally briefed” on the intelligence. “I thought that before the hearing and has nothing to do with anything that we were presented at the hearing,” Pelosi, D-Calif, said. “Of course, the president should have been briefed. This is of the highest priority. Force protection, a threat to our men and women in uniform.” “The president, it was in his PDB, presidential daily brief, but it wasn't verbally,” she asserted. “That doesn't mean that he shouldn’t have read that. But again it has nothing to do with we saw today.” Pelosi did not make clear how she could definitively say that the bounty intelligence made it into the written presidential daily brief. A Pelosi spokesman later said that the speaker’s claim that the intel made it into the written daily brief “was referencing news reports.” While the White House claims intelligence about the bounty reports was not fully verified by the U.S., a military official confirmed to ABC News on Sunday that Russian intelligence officers offered to pay Taliban militants to kill American troops in Afghanistan over the past year, amid peace talks to end the 18-year war there. Trump has continued to call news reports about the bounties a ""hoax."" U.S. intelligence agencies linked the effort to a Russian intelligence unit suspected of covert action and assassination attempts in Europe, according to The New York Times, which first reported the intelligence findings said to have been presented to Trump in March. The president and vice president have both denied that they were briefed on the matter. Pelosi, who indicated that congressional leaders were not briefed on the matter, continued to blast Trump’s desire to welcome Russian President Vladimir Putin back into the G-8. “It was of a consequential level that the intelligence community should have brought it to us in that way. But what is important is president’s relationship with Russia,” Pelosi said. “At the same time as the White House was aware of this threat to the security of our men and women in uniform, the President was still flirting with the idea of having Russia be part of the G8, in total opposition to the wishes of the other members of the G-8.” Last year, 23 U.S. troops were killed in Afghanistan, but whether any were targeted by Taliban fighters paid by Russian operatives isn't known, the military official told ABC News. The official didn't know whether Trump was briefed but said other senior U.S. officials learned of the Russian operation ""months ago."" Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe and General Paul M. Nakasone, Commander, U.S. Cyber Command, also joined Haspel for the briefing, according to a source familiar with the matter. Pelosi also her call to expand sanctions against Russia, including against Russian intelligence and the defense sectors. “We have to restore those,” she told reporters at a news conference in the Capitol Thursday afternoon. “Whatever else happens with this, we must restore all those sanctions and we must act upon them.” Several lawmakers from both parties attended briefings earlier this week at the White House, although Pelosi and Schumer have continued to press the administration to conduct briefings for the entire congressional membership. Democrats characterized the White House briefing Tuesday as inadequate, calling on the administration to provide “direct evidence and discussion from intelligence community into how credible they assess the information.” Majority Leader Steny Hoyer called the intelligence a “red flag” and said the American people must understand whether the United States’ relationship with Russia is “compromised by the relationship between the president and Mr. Putin.” ABC News’ James Gordon Meek and Luis Martinez contributed to this report.",20,,,,16

David Berger, the Marine Corps commandant, told ABC News on Tuesday that while he saw no evidence of Russians offering bounties to kill U.S. troops during his time commanding Marines in Afghanistan, the families of fallen service members are ""entitled"" to answers. ""You just have to look at the facts like always, investigate thoroughly,"" said Berger, who spoke with ABC News Chief Global Affairs Correspondent Martha Raddatz in an exclusive interview airing this Sunday. The White House on Tuesday continued to provide briefings to select members of Congress on the intelligence about reported Russian bounties on U.S. troops in Afghanistan, which a military official told ABC News showed that Russian intelligence officers had over the past year offered to pay Taliban militants to kill American troops. Lawmakers have called on the administration to share more information and potentially take action. One of the incidents being looked at for a possible connection to the alleged Russian scheme is an April 8, 2019 bomb blast on an American military convoy near Bagram Air Base that killed three Marines, according to The Associated Press. Cpl. Robert A. Hendriks, Sgt. Benjamin S. Hines and Staff Sgt. Christopher K.A. Slutman were all killed when a car bomb detonated near their vehicle as their convoy headed back to the base. They were among the 23 Americans who died in Afghanistan in 2019 either from combat or non-combat reasons. Hendriks' father Erik told ABC News on Tuesday that it would ""break his heart"" to find out that reports of Russian bounties were true. ""If 1 ounce of American blood was spilled, and this possibility of Russian involvement was not given to our Warriors on the ground, then yes! Shame on this administration as to send a Marine in an already chaotic and dangerous war zone being shorted intel,"" Erik Hendriks told ABC News in a text message. ""(If it's true) yes it cheats every man woman, husband son and daughter of life or death information. I pray this is not what my government has come to. I hope this proves wrong."" Erik Hendriks also said over the phone that he was disappointed no one from the Trump administration has yet reached out to his family to offer consolation or answers, but was careful to divorce his anger from politics. ""I'm not shooting darts at Trump's face,"" he said, also stating that he has earned the right to speculate and question. Berger told Raddatz that he doesn't recall ever seeing anything about Russian meddling, but said, ""it takes a lot to surprise me now."" ""Where we operated in southern Helmand we didn't have, to my knowledge, Russian influence,"" Berger said. ""It could have been, but I was not aware of it."" The information about the Russian bounty program was first gleaned from special operations raids on Taliban locations in January where large amounts of American cash was found, according to a military official. Subsequent intelligence about the program was specific enough that both the military and CIA took steps to increase security and surveillance of Russian operatives inside Afghanistan, a source told ABC News. Months later that intelligence was briefed to senior national security officials, according to the military official. President Donald Trump and White House officials have said he was not briefed on the intelligence because it had not been fully verified by the U.S. intelligence community. But the New York Times quotes two officials as saying that the information was included in written form in the president's daily intelligence briefing from late February. While the April 2019 incident is among those under investigation for possible links to the bounty program, the Pentagon said in a statement issued late Monday that it has not found any corroborating evidence. ""The Department of Defense continues to evaluate intelligence that Russian GRU operatives were engaged in malign activity against United States and coalition forces in Afghanistan,"" said Jonathan Hoffman, the Pentagon's chief spokesman. ""To date, DOD has no corroborating evidence to validate the recent allegations found in open-source reports. Regardless, we always take the safety and security of our forces in Afghanistan -- and around the world -- most seriously and therefore continuously adopt measures to prevent harm from potential threats."" The director of national intelligence and the CIA decried the intelligence leaks about the Russian bounty program in separate statements Monday, saying it could hamper their ongoing analysis about the Russian program.

2020-07-01,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-calls-russia-bounty-allegations-hoax-white-house/story?id=71554120,Trump calls Russia bounty reports 'hoax' even as White House briefs intel on it,"Even as the White House provided briefings this week to members of Congress on the intelligence behind reports Russia offered bounties to Taliban militants to kill U.S. troops, President Donald Trump on Wednesday tried to discredit them as ""made up"" and a ""hoax"" designed to ""slander"" him. ""The Russia Bounty story is just another made up by Fake News tale that is told only to damage me and the Republican Party,"" Trump tweeted Wednesday, going after The New York Times, which first reported on the intelligence on Friday and also reported that Trump had been briefed on it. ""The secret source probably does not even exist, just like the story itself. If the discredited @nytimes has a source, reveal it. Just another HOAX!"" But just as Trump repeated the message in a second tweet -- saying it was ""all a made up Fake News Media Hoax started to slander me & the Republican Party"" -- top White House aides tried to argue that the president wasn’t actually calling the underlying intelligence “fake” but was instead taking issue with media reporting. ""I think what is a hoax is the initial reporting,” National Security Adviser Robert O'Brien told reporters at the White House Wednesday. ""And I believe this was The New York Times -- that the president had been briefed about this unverified, uncorroborated intelligence, and chose not to take action on it. That was a hoax, and there's no question about it."" Trump first used the word ""hoax"" in connection to the new reporting on Sunday night, writing in a tweet it was ""possibly another fabricated Russia Hoax."" White House counselor Kellyanne Conway said Wednesday she thought the “hoax” the president was referring to was the idea that “he was somehow briefed on it and didn't take action on it and looked the other way.” Even as the White House sticks to its narrative that the intelligence never rose to the level to warrant a formal briefing of the president, O'Brien noted the U.S. had previously shared the information with other countries fighting in Afghanistan. The White House has repeatedly said Trump was not briefed on the intelligence before The New York Times first reported on it, although top officials have been more vague about whether it had been included in the president's written briefing materials months ago. Multiple news outlets, citing unnamed sources, have reported that the intelligence had been included in the written materials, known as the President's Daily Brief. The White House this week provided separate briefings for groups of select Republican and Democratic members of Congress but has so far not acceded to Democratic congressional leaders' request that all members of both the Senate and House of Representatives get briefed. The first bipartisan briefing for the ""Gang of Eight"" -- a group of senior lawmakers from both parties that is regularly informed of sensitive intelligence -- is expected to take place on Thursday on Capitol Hill, according to a White House official and a senior aide to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. The meeting had previously been expected for Wednesday. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Wednesday attacked lawmakers expressing outrage now, saying they had previously seen the same intelligence, although he did not clarify about exactly whom or when he was referring. ""They saw the same intelligence that we saw, so it would be interesting to ask them what they did when they saw whatever intelligence it is they're referring to,"" Pompeo told reporters. ""They would have had access to this information as well -- not just the intelligence committees, by the way, even more broadly than that."" Pompeo and other Trump administration officials have forcefully defended the president's approach to Russia, as a bipartisan chorus of members of Congress have expressed concern that Russia's actions may have potentially cost U.S. lives. ""The president has been consistently aware of the challenges that Russia presents to us, and he is aware of the risk in Afghanistan,"" Pompeo said. The criticism has forced the White House to rush to contain the political fallout of the revelations. Democrats, sometimes joined by those on the other side of the aisle, have long alleged Trump has not responded forcefully enough to Russia's provocative behavior. In the four days since the first report on the intelligence, Trump avoided questions and did not appear publicly. He did not have any public appearances on his schedule on Wednesday either, although he planned to be interviewed by the Fox Business network. The White House has faced mounting questions Tuesday about how much and how long Trump has known about the alleged Russian bounties. Lawmakers called on the administration to share more information and potentially take action. ABC News' Conor Finnegan contributed reporting.",20,,,,16

The White House on Tuesday continued to provide briefings to select members of Congress on the intelligence, which a military official told ABC News showed that Russian intelligence officers had over the past year offered to pay Taliban militants to kill American troops. But the Trump administration resisted providing the wider briefings requested by Democratic congressional leaders and neither Trump nor other White House officials were speaking or answering questions publicly on the matter Tuesday. Republican lawmakers joined their Democratic colleagues in expressing concern that Russia's actions may have potentially cost U.S. lives, forcing the White House to rush to contain the political fallout of the revelations. Democrats, sometimes joined by those on the other side of the aisle, have long alleged Trump has not responded forcefully enough to Russia's provocative behavior. Even as top U.S. intelligence and national security officials issued a series of rare, on-the-record statements emphasizing what they portrayed as the inconclusive nature of the intelligence, new reports called into question why Trump and the White House continued to insist he had not been briefed on the matter. The Associated Press reported Monday, citing unnamed U.S. officials, that top White House officials were aware of the intelligence early last year and that the information had been included in Trump's written intelligence briefing, known as the President's Daily Brief, at the time. It was not clear if the president had actually read the briefing, though. The AP also reported that John Bolton, who was national security adviser at the time, told colleagues that in March 2019 he had briefed Trump about the intelligence. Bolton declined to comment on the report, during an interview Tuesday with Sirius XM's ""The Joe Madison Show"" Tuesday. The New York Times, citing two unnamed officials, reported that Trump had received a written briefing on the topic in late February. Again, it was unclear if he had read the briefing materials. White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said Monday that the president had yet to be briefed on the intelligence, noting ""the veracity of the underlying allegations continue to be evaluated."" Asked if the information had not been in the President's Daily Brief, too, she replied, ""He was not personally briefed on the matter."" The night before, Trump had tweeted, ""Intel just reported to me that they did not find this info credible, and therefore did not report it to me or"" the vice president. Asked on Monday what Trump meant, McEnany replied, ""I have no further details on the president’s private correspondence."" On Monday night, top intelligence and national security officials released statements – apparently coordinated, using similar language – casting doubt on the reports. U.S. National Security Adviser Robert O’Brien said the administration, including the National Security Council, had “been preparing should the situation warrant action.” Like O’Brien, Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe and Central Intelligence Agency Director Gina Haspel had tough words for those who leak classified information to members of the press. Pentagon spokesman Jonathan Hoffman, referring to the Russian military unit said to have been involved, said that the “Department of Defense continues to evaluate intelligence that Russian GRU operatives were engaged in malign activity against United States and coalition forces in Afghanistan.” Rather than brief members of Congress of both parties simultaneously as is standard, the White House has been offering small-group briefings split along party lines. A group of Republican congressional allies were the first to be briefed Monday, followed by a small group of congressional Democrats on Monday morning and a separate briefing for Senate Republicans were also expected later in the morning. House Democrats emerged from the briefing renewing their call for an all-member briefing from the intelligence community, with House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer saying the briefing “was not as a substitute” for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Sen. Chuck Schumer’s requests for a full briefing for all Members of Congress. “The president called this a hoax publicly. Nothing in the briefing that we have just received led me to believe it is a hoax,” Hoyer said. “There may be different judgments as to the level of credibly but there was no assertion that the information we had was a hoax.” While the lawmakers refused to discuss details of the briefing due to its secret nature, Schiff emphasized that the briefing fell short – complaining that the “right people to give the briefing really were not in the room.” “We need to hear from the heads of the intelligence agencies about how do they assess the allegations,” Schiff said. “What can they tell us about the truth or falsity of these allegations? What can they tell us about steps they are taking or undertaking to vet the information they may have?” Those briefing the House Democrats included National Security Adviser Robert O'Brien, Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe, White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, and three other senior National Security Council officials, according to an aide to Hoyer. It’s not just political leaders demanding answers. So, too, is the father of a Marine killed in an April 2019 attack. The father of Cpl. Robert Hendriks, 25, of Locust Valley, New York told the AP in an interview that U.S. officials should have immediately addressed the allegations, even if they were just a rumor. “If this was kind of swept under the carpet as to not make it a bigger issue with Russia, and one ounce of blood was spilled when they knew this, I lost all respect for this administration and everything,” Erik Hendriks said. The AP has reported that the attack that killed Hendriks and two other Marines in April 2019 is under investigation in connection to the alleged Russian bounties. GOP Sen. Ben Sasse of Nebraska said Monday he had heard from many military families in his home state who were ""livid."" He said Congress must focus on several questions. ""Number one: Who knew what, when, and did the commander in chief know? And if not, how the hell not? What is going on in the process?"" he said. ""And number two, what are we going to do to impose proportional cost in response?"" He said such a response would amount to Taliban and Russian intelligence operative ""body bags.""

2020-06-28,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/russians-offered-taliban-bounties-kill-us-troops-military/story?id=71495576,Russians offered Taliban bounties to kill US troops: Military official,"Russian intelligence officers offered to pay Taliban militants to kill American troops in Afghanistan over the past year, amid peace talks to end the 18-year war there, a military official confirmed to ABC News on Sunday. U.S. intelligence agencies linked the effort to a Russian intelligence unit suspected of covert action and assassination attempts in Europe, according to The New York Times, which first reported the intelligence findings said to have been presented to President Donald Trump in March. Last year, 23 U.S. troops died in Afghanistan, but whether any were targeted by Taliban fighters paid by Russian operatives isn't known, the military official said. The official didn't know whether Trump was briefed but said other senior U.S. officials learned of the Russian operation ""months ago."" ""There is no way to really confirm if it actually worked,"" the military official, who's not authorized to speak on the record about such matters, told ABC News. A White House spokesperson declined to comment on the veracity of the intelligence report but denied Trump was informed in March. ""While the White House does not routinely comment on alleged intelligence or internal deliberations, the CIA Director, National Security Advisor, and the Chief of Staff can all confirm that neither the President nor the Vice President were briefed on the alleged Russian bounty intelligence. This does not speak to the merit of the alleged intelligence but to the inaccuracy of the New York Times story erroneously suggesting that President Trump was briefed on this matter,"" White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany said in a statement on Sunday. President Donald Trump himself denied ever being briefed in a tweet published early Sunday morning and added that ""nobody has been tougher on Russia than the Trump Administration."" A counterterrorism source confirmed to ABC News, as first reported in the New York Times, that this information first came to light around January after U.S. special operations raids in Afghanistan where cash was found. There are about 8,600 U.S. troops still in Afghanistan -- many are special operations forces -- but sources told ABC News it isn't clear which troops the Russians wanted the Taliban to kill. The New York Times report also said that no decisions have been made inside the White House for any kind of response. Besides the peace talks, which resulted in an accord reached Feb. 29 between the U.S. and the Taliban that set conditions for a drawdown to the war that began after al Qaeda perpetrated the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, America's relationship with Russia came up in Trump's remarks last spring well after the intelligence assessment circulated inside the administration. ""We have this great friendship. And, by the way, getting along with Russia is a great thing, getting along with [President Vladimir] Putin and Russia is a great thing,"" Trump said on May 8. The President also moved last month to postpone the G7 and said he wants to invite Russia to rejoin. ""Russia is an enemy of the United States. We identify them as such in our national security strategy, but treat them as if they are allies. Why else would we be pushing to include a country in the G7 that invaded another country and is now killing our soldiers?"" said Mick Mulroy, an ABC News contributor who served as a CIA officer and deputy assistant secretary of defense for the Middle East. Since the war in Afghanistan began in 2001, at least 2,310 U.S. troops have died. This is not the first time American forces have bumped up against the Russian military. U.S. Special Forces have even encountered Russian soldiers in Afghanistan in little-known incidents. American commandos also have often encountered Russian troops in the complicated Syrian battle space, and U.S. fighter intercepts of Russian military aircraft skirting U.S. airspace have been frequent this year. In 2018, Russian mercenaries from the Wagner Group launched a full-on tank and artillery strike on a U.S. special operations outpost in Dar al Zour, Syria, and the U.S. airstrikes resulted in hundreds of casualties among the attacking forces. ABC News reported at the time that Wagner was behind the attack and is funded by a close ally of Putin, Yevgeny Progozhin -- known as ""Putin's Chef"" -- who also ran the ""troll farm"" accused by the U.S. of interfering in the 2016 presidential election. ""We do not want a war with Russia and we do not want to start killing each other's soldiers, but there are some actions you can't accept,"" Mulroy said. ""If we have solid evidence that this is being done and our forces are being killed, the gloves should be hitting the floor.""",20,,,,16
2020-06-11,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/US/intel-bulletin-warns-malign-actors-targeting-us-george/story?id=71184163,Intel bulletin warns of 'malign actors' targeting US over George Floyd fallout,"As protesters hit the streets in cities across the country, America's foreign adversaries have flooded social media with content meant to sow division and discord in the wake of George Floyd's death, according to a U.S. government intelligence bulletin obtained by ABC News. The bulletin, distributed Tuesday to law enforcement by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), accuses Russia, China and Iran of ""employing state media, proxy outlets, and social media accounts to amplify criticism of the United States related to the death of George Floyd and subsequent events."" These ""malign actors"" also appear intent on drawing attention to alleged hypocrisy in the Trump administration's handling of protesters, the report found. The death of 46-year-old George Floyd last month, at the hands of a former Minneapolis police officer, has sparked outrage and protest from coast to coast, prompting calls for an overhaul of police practices. In the intervening weeks, foreign adversaries have sought to leverage the residual domestic strife resulting from Floyd's death to pursue geopolitical goals, the bulletin claimed, including an ongoing effort to weaken Washington's image on the international stage. ""These actors criticize the United States as hypocritical, corrupt, undemocratic, racist, guilty of human rights abuses and on the verge of collapsing,"" the report found. For Russia, this finding represents the latest chapter in Moscow's age-old information warfare playbook, according to John Cohen, a former senior DHS official and current ABC News contributor. ""This is yet another indicator that Russia is using the combination of overt propaganda and covertly disseminated disinformation to sow discord across our populace, expand the cracks in our society, and undermine the credibility of the U.S. government,"" Cohen said. During the 2016 election, Russian proxies conducted ""a social media campaign designed to provoke and amplify political and social discord in the United States,"" according to former special counsel Robert Mueller in his March 2019 report on Russian meddling. Since then, Russian actors have honed in on race-related incidents in America. In October of 2018, for example, the Justice Department charged a Russian woman for her alleged role in a plot to influence public opinion ahead of the 2018 midterm elections to ""aggravate the conflict between minorities and the rest of the population."" Prosecutors said the woman and her Russian partners ""took advantage of specific events in the United States to anchor their themes,"" including the NFL kneeling controversy, the 2017 ""Unite the Right"" rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, and the 2015 racially-motivated shooting at a Charleston, South Carolina, church. After the Charlottesville rally, a Republican member of Congress told CNN that the FBI had evidence that Russians had used the event to enflame racial tensions on social media. The intelligence bulletin also cited Russian state-run media outlets Ruptly, RT France and Going Underground on RT as applauding Americans for being ""justified in rioting against the 'corrupt American capitalist system.'"" ""Russian state-media-affiliated social media accounts shared imagery of police responses to the protests, the use of tear gas by the National Guard and called the protests a 'revolt' that 'has reached the front door of the US empire,'"" the bulletin continued. The U.S. intelligence community has previously designated multiple state-run media outlets as ""international propaganda outlets,"" according to a January 2017 report gathered by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. Likewise, in Tehran, state-run media outlets were found to promote claims that U.S. officials acted ""[hypocritically] in its treatment of its citizens"" and were ""guilty of human rights violations,"" the bulletin suggested. ""As the protests developed, Iranian state narratives shifted focus to the US Government's allegedly undemocratic and corrupt treatment of the press,"" the bulletin continued. ""Iranian Government officials … called for an international investigation of, and trial of US leaders for, human rights violations."" Chinese state-run media outlets and officials echoed those sentiments, calling ""the US Government response to protests is hypocritical when compared with its statements regarding China's handling of protests in Hong Kong."" The U.S. has, in recent years, criticized leaders in both Tehran and Beijing for their handling of civil demonstrations. In January, President Donald Trump tweeted support for the ""wonderful Iranian protesters."" In November, he infuriated Chinese leaders by signing two bills in support of pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong. Critics fear the Trump administration's combative posture toward protesters at home, however, could undermine its credibility and leadership on the world stage. ""In recent history, America's leaders have tried to send a unifying message both at home and also to the world, but President Trump has abandoned any normative restraints, calling up the military, using tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse peaceful protesters, and tweeting inflammatory messages that stoke division and inflame the situation,"" said Dr. Leslie Vinjamuri, the leader of the U.S. & Americas program at Chatham House, a think tank based in London. ""The riots have also unfolded after nearly four years of a president that has chipped away, but with a sledgehammer, at America's moral authority,"" she added. Confronted by a reporter on that alleged hypocrisy, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo called the question ""troubling,"" and accused the reporter of drawing an improper ""moral equivalency"" to the nature of protests in the U.S. and those abroad. ""They repress their people, and they bludgeon their people, and they burn down their religious facilities and they deny journalists -- you all -- a chance to ask a question of a secretary of state,"" Pompeo said, specifically citing the Chinese response to protests in Hong Kong. And it is not just American racial tensions the ""malign actors"" have allegedly sought to use against the U.S. A similar DHS bulletin distributed last month accused Russian and China of ""conducting COVID-19 pandemic-related malign influence and disinformation campaigns targeting U.S. and global audiences to deflect criticism of China's initial response, raising doubts about the Chinese origins of the virus and mischaracterizing Chinese and Western responses as the virus spreads globally.""

2020-04-28,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/International/intel-report-warns-zoom-vulnerable-foreign-surveillance/story?id=70376203,Intel report warns Zoom could be vulnerable to foreign surveillance,"The Zoom videoconferencing platform, so popular with people forced to stay home because of the coronavirus pandemic, could be vulnerable to intrusions by foreign government spy services, including China, according to a federal intelligence analysis obtained by ABC News. The analysis urges organizations to carefully consider the risk if they should continue working with the system. The report was issued jointly by the Department of Homeland Security’s Cyber Mission and Counterintelligence Mission centers, and was distributed to law enforcement and government agencies around the country. It comes less than a month after the FBI’s Boston office warned that hackers were able to hijack or disrupt videoconferences in what has come to be known as “Zoom-bombing.” Hackers “likely will identify new or use existing vulnerabilities in Zoom to compromise user devices and accounts for further exploitation of corporate networks,” the notice says. Even security fixes don’t eliminate the concerns, analysts said, because “the patching process is undermined by … actors who often capitalize on delays and develop exploits based on the vulnerability and available patches.” A Zoom spokesperson told ABC News the company disagrees with the intelligence analysis and that it is “heavily misinformed, includes blatant inaccuracies about Zoom’s operations, and the authors themselves admit only ‘moderate confidence’ in their own reporting. We are disappointed the authors did not engage with Zoom to verify the accuracy of these claims and understand the real facts about Zoom.” Regarding previously reported security issues, the company said, ""We actively and quickly addressed specific security concerns as they were raised over the past few weeks.” DHS intelligence experts noted the popularity of Zoom has skyrocketed with the platform’s daily user base growing, according to company statistics, from 10 million a day to 200 million since December. While in the last six weeks, government stay-home orders have forced learning, government and business operations to migrate from physical spaces to the internet. “Zoom’s sudden immense growth and use across both public and private sector entities in combination with its highly publicized cybersecurity issues creates a vulnerable, target-rich environment,” the intelligence notice says. “Any organization currently using – or considering using – Zoom should evaluate the risk of its use.” Among the specific concerns laid out by analysts is the risk posed by some development work for Zoom that is done in China. Because of China’s strict intelligence and intellectual property rules, “China’s access to Zoom servers makes Beijing uniquely positioned to target US public and private sector users,” according to the document. “China’s unique position does not prevent other nation-states from using Zoom vulnerabilities to achieve their objectives.” And, analysts said, hackers could use Zoom’s system to deploy malware that could then make a third party’s computer system susceptible to a security breach. The Zoom spokesperson said that the company ""has layered safeguards, robust cybersecurity protection, and internal controls in place to prevent unauthorized access to data” and that its “developers in China do not have any access to Zoom’s production environment, the power or access to make substantive changes to our platform or the means to access any meeting content."" The spokesperson said Zoom's systems are ""designed to maintain geo-fencing around China ensuring that users outside of China do not have their meeting data routed through servers in China."" Additionally, paid Zoom customers ""are now able to further customize which data center regions their account can use for real-time meeting traffic,"" which allows them to ""opt in or out of specific data center locations,"" the spokesperson said. The spokesperson said that in addition to the use of cloud data centers globally, Zoom had 17 data centers ""around the world,” but only one is in China. ""All Zoom source code is stored and versioned in the United States,"" the spokesperson said. John Cohen, a former DHS acting undersecretary who used to oversee the department’s intelligence operations, said in general, “China, Russia and other hostile nations view the coronavirus as an opportunity to expand their intelligence-gathering efforts and they are actively targeting the private communications of those in government, the private sector, academia and others, who have increasingly turned to online communications."" “Private conversations using online communications and video conferencing apps are vulnerable to being intercepted by criminals and foreign intelligence operatives,"" said Cohen, a current ABC News contributor. ""Securing these platforms must be a priority especially since they are being used more frequently during the current public health crisis.”",20,,,,17
2020-04-14,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/International/amid-coronavirus-chaos-russian-spies-opportunity-intelligence-assessment/story?id=70129688,"Amid coronavirus chaos, Russian spies see opportunity: Intelligence assessment","As Russia’s leaders concede coronavirus is now an “emergency” in that country, Moscow’s intelligence services remain hard at work searching for an angle amid tragedy that could give them an upper hand over the U.S., according to a new U.S. intelligence analysis obtained by ABC News. The assessment says U.S. intelligence suspects that their Russian counterparts have been trying to sow discord and chaos in America by amplifying social media messages that push conspiracy theories and other narratives that could cause people to lose faith in their government and communities. At the same time, analysts say Russians would have been closely monitoring the well-documented failings in the U.S. healthcare system laid bare by the coronavirus pandemic. “Russia has devised an asymmetric military doctrine to be used in combination with conventional tactics,” according to the April 6 document distributed to U.S. law enforcement by the Department of Homeland Security. The Russians hope to “sap the will to fight from its adversary by, among other things, putting pressure on the population at the same time as engaging militarily.” ""During peacetime,"" the analysis says, ""Russia prepares the ground in the event of hostilities by collecting intelligence on the vulnerabilities of each target. During degraded relations, Russia conducts some operations to keep its adversary off balance, such as disinformation campaigns and possibly mapping the medical supply chain.” For instance, the document says that medical first responders ""as of mid-March lacked enough supplies of COVID-19 test kits, personal protection equipment, and ventilators because the supply chain was unprepared for a pandemic, according to credible press reporting.” “This information could fulfill Russia’s collection requirements to understand vulnerabilities in the US medical supply chain,"" the document says. Such efforts by Russian intelligence should come as no surprise, according to ABC News contributor John Cohen, who used to lead intelligence operations at DHS. “Russia, terrorist groups and other adversaries are watching carefully how the U.S. responds to the COVID-19 pandemic so that they can identify weaknesses in our defenses that could be exploited to conduct future attacks,” said Cohen, a former acting undersecretary of DHS. “There is no doubt that Russia would seek to exploit the current public health crisis to achieve their objectives.” The intelligence analysis was distributed last week, just days before the Kremlin admitted Saturday for the first time that there was a “huge influx” of patients in Moscow and that hospitals are now working in “emergency mode.” The day before, a deputy to Moscow mayor said that the number of hospital admissions had doubled in a week. Russia’s confirmed coronavirus numbers have been jumping by over 1,000 a day for the past few days, and Monday saw a huge leap of over 2,500 new cases in 24 hours. The country’s total now stands at 18,328 cases, with a reported 130 deaths. Adding to the concerns is the reality that Russia’s ramshackle health service could be no match for the health crisis if it worsens, especially outside Moscow. Outside some cities, the Russian military has been building special coronavirus hospitals, which authorities say are intended to create thousands more beds for those being treated.

2020-03-26,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/fbi-learned-coronavirus-inspired-bomb-plotter-radicalized-us/story?id=69818116,FBI learned of coronavirus-inspired bomb plotter through radicalized US Army soldier,"The suspected white supremacist who plotted to bomb a hospital facing the coronavirus crisis was in touch with a then-active U.S. Army soldier who wanted to launch his own attack on a major American news network and discussed targeting a Democratic presidential candidate, according to an FBI alert summarizing the case. On Tuesday, as 36-year-old Timothy Wilson was on the verge of trying to detonate a car bomb at a Kansas City-area medical center, agents from the FBI’s field office in Missouri attempted to arrest him. But shots were fired, fatally wounding Wilson, according to the FBI. Ahead of Tuesday’s incident, Wilson “espoused white supremacist ideology” and “made a threat that if any agent attempted to [search his property] they should ‘bring a lot of body bags,” said the FBI alert, distributed to state and local law enforcement agencies in the region on Wednesday. Tune into ABC at 1 p.m. ET and ABC News Live at 4 p.m. ET every weekday for special coverage of the novel coronavirus with the full ABC News team, including the latest news, context and analysis. The FBI alert also said Wilson had “shared instructions on how to make an [improvised explosive device] with another ... Domestic Terrorism (DT) subject” from near Kansas City. ABC News has identified that other domestic terrorism “subject” as Jarrett Smith, who was arrested in September 2019 while still stationed at Ft. Riley, Kansas, as an active member of the U.S. Army. According to charging documents filed at the time in Topeka, Kansas, Smith allegedly planned to travel to Ukraine to fight with the violent far-right group Azov Battalion; suggested targeting then-Democratic presidential candidate Beto O’Rourke; proposed bombing the headquarters of a still-unidentified news network; and distributed bomb-making tips online. Smith has since pleaded guilty to federal charges of distributing information that relates to weapons of mass destruction, and he is awaiting sentencing. On Wednesday, sources familiar with the matter told ABC News that Wilson had been on the FBI’s radar for more than a year, indicating that the FBI’s probe of Smith led authorities to Wilson months before he sought to take advantage of the unfolding coronavirus crisis. “With the current COVID-19 pandemic, Wilson decided to accelerate his plan to detonate a [car bomb] to cause severe harm and mass casualties,” the FBI said in its alert. “Wilson may have also believed the additional stress on society posed by the COVID-19 pandemic provided unique opportunities to exploit.” The FBI believes other extremists inside the U.S. homeland may similarly “aspire to capitalize on the current health crisis,” but it is “unlikely” any of their actions “will rise to the level of terroristic actions like Wilson,” the alert issued Wednesday said. During a conference call with police chiefs from across the nation on Friday, the Department of Homeland Security’s assistant secretary for Infrastructure Protection, Brian Harrell, and the department’s liaison to state and local law enforcement, John Hill, tried to assure the chiefs that the federal government is doing all it can to protect “critical infrastructure” in their cities and towns, including hospitals. But even before coronavirus became a crisis inside America, Harrell offered this stark assessment: “Based off of current events and the frequency of events, I am convinced that this country is becoming more and more violent every single day.” “I live my life as if the worst day is right around the corner,” he told Congress last month, adding that the U.S. government is “focused on preparedness and protection.”",20,,,,2
2020-03-17,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/early-coronavirus-pandemic-officials-minimal-disruption-national-security/story?id=69631615,"Early in coronavirus pandemic, officials say minimal disruption in national security measures","Officials in the U.S. intelligence community are used to hunkering down in bunkers and windowless vaults during times of international crisis, but the novel coronavirus threatens a workforce that can't keep the respiratory bug completely out of their secret workspaces. But the plodding work of protecting America from human adversaries marches on regardless, they say. Tune into ABC News Live at noon EDT every weekday for the latest news, context and analysis on the novel coronavirus, with the full ABC News team where we will try to answer your questions about the virus. ""We're doing what we normally would do if there was a snowstorm,"" one senior intelligence official told ABC News on Sunday. The official spoke from home but planned to return to the office come Monday morning. So far officials tell ABC News that only one FBI employee is known to have tested positive and none have at CIA, where a single suspected case reported recently ended up testing negative for the virus currently upending workplaces and the end of the school year for millions of American workers and their families. Despite many staggered and adjusted work schedules and unnecessary travel canceled, ranging from FBI field offices in the U.S. to CIA headquarters and the offices of 15 other agencies comprising the U.S. intelligence community, top officials say global intelligence, counterterrorism and counter-intelligence operations have continued mostly uninterrupted in recent weeks. ""We've seen people cleared to go do stuff overseas that needs to be done because it's time-sensitive. I have not heard of any major op being delayed,"" the senior intelligence official said. A counterterrorism official serving overseas echoed that, saying non-essential travel had been ordered stopped at some secret U.S. facilities, but added, ""We are locked down. Zero drama."" But the officials also offered an important caveat about whether critical operations to protect the nation from its adversaries will remain uninterrupted: America is only a few weeks into the COVID-19 crisis and no one knows what its impact will be from a contagion which President Donald Trump warned on Monday may haunt the country until the end of the summer. The CIA has stations in China, Spain, France, South Korea and Italy -- all the countries hardest hit so far. And some officials expressed concern to ABC News that traditional adversaries, be it terrorist groups such as the Islamic State or state actors, including China or Russia, could strike at the West during this time of heightened anxiety even though stores and restaurants and streets have emptied in affected U.S. towns and cities. Many intelligence officers in the Washington area have had to adjust their work schedules because schools in the area closed starting Monday and their kids are home, the officials said. Intelligence analysts handling highly classified matters have had to adjust their work schedules to accommodate precautions being taken nationwide to mitigate the spread of the virus. ""People are taking prudent measures. Because of the nature of the work, telecommuting is all but impossible,"" said another senior intelligence official. ""But there has been a shifting of work schedules because their kids are home. Folks are working different hours. Maximum flexibility is being offered,"" the official said. And section chiefs are making room for crews to scrub down offices critical to national security. One senior official at the Department of Homeland Security working late said they were cleaning off their desk at the office ""so the cleaners can easily access it."" But overseas, where many American intelligence agencies operate against adversaries, it may be more challenging to prevent coronavirus from impacting the work of FBI agents, CIA officers and their assets, said Darrell Blocker, an ABC News contributor and a retired CIA official who helped formulate the intelligence community's response to an Ebola outbreak when he was the Agency's Africa Division chief in 2015. ""Travel, operations and every aspect of HUMINT (human intelligence collection) will be negatively impacted,"" Blocker predicted. The FBI has weighed in publicly on the potential of coronavirus-caused disruptions. ""FBI operations are directed toward national security and violations of federal law and will continue unabated,"" an FBI spokesperson said in a statement last week. ""In support of our mission, we are enacting measures to protect the FBI workforce, including heightened hygiene practices, social distancing options, like telework and flexible work schedules where appropriate and authorizing only essential operational travel until further notice. The FBI will continue steadfast in our mission to protect the American people and uphold the Constitution throughout this period of national emergency.""",20,,,,17
2020-03-17,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/Health/facing-coronavirus-pandemic-us-confronts-cyber-attacks/story?id=69653329,"Facing coronavirus pandemic, US confronts cyberattacks","The United States, already dealing with the coronavirus pandemic, is also being targeted for cyberattacks and foreign disinformation campaigns, as federal officials feared. Multiple sources confirmed to ABC News in recent days that both the efforts that slowed computer systems at the Health and Human Services Department Sunday night and the weekend rash of bogus text messages warning a national quarantine is imminent were the products of foreign actors or components of foreign governments or entities connected to them. ""We are seeing multiple disinformation campaigns right now,"" said one federal official briefed on the situation. The two types of cyber incidents are different, but both are aimed at sowing panic in the American population and feeding distrust in government, according to intelligence officials. Federal officials said the two most likely perpetrators are Russia and China, two nations with the sophistication, skill and desire to carry out such campaigns against the U.S. Tune into ABC at 1 p.m. ET and ABC News Live at 4 p.m. ET every weekday for special coverage of the novel coronavirus with the full ABC News team, including the latest news, context and analysis. In the case of the HHS incident, officials said outsiders deployed automated users -- called bots -- to target the public-facing computer system. A source familiar with the investigation into the incident told ABC News that it is thought to be either a widespread campaign to scan HHS systems for vulnerabilities, or possibly a ""clumsy"" attempt to paralyze public online systems with a flood of visitors, something called distributed denial of service, or DDOS. ""When you're dealing with something like a denial of service attack on HHS during a pandemic, that's a very grave action for another country to take,"" Attorney General William Barr told The Associated Press Tuesday, confirming that an investigation is ongoing. ""So, if it is another country doing this, I'm sure the ramifications will be severe."" More insidious was the attack that began late last week in the New York City area and then broadened to Washington, D.C., Boston, Kansas and the West Coast where an entity infiltrated the cellphone MMS and SMS text-messaging system to send out realistic-looking warnings about an impending shutdown of public and government services because of the coronavirus outbreak. Sunday afternoon, suspicious texts made their way to medical staff in at least one department of a top hospital the Boston area, according to a recipient there. The person who had passed it along to the department said they had received the original message from an out-of-state ""friend,"" who was described as credible and had received the message from elsewhere. Texts were also received by doctors in at least one major hospital in San Francisco and by some members of the military around the country. In New York City, the messages spread like wildfire and told people to stock up on money and food because bridges, tunnels and mass transit would be shutting down. By the weekend, messages were pinging cellphones all over the nation's capital region saying that an unnamed friend's brother had come out of a meeting and that the president was poised to enact a national quarantine within days. The message instructed recipients to share it -- like a panic-inducing chain letter. Late Sunday night, one official told ABC News, ""It was a cyberattack -- we're trying to track and origin."" By Monday, the intelligence community, officials said, had determined the source was foreign and that the technique was sophisticated. The U.S. intelligence community is leading the effort to find the culprits; by law, agencies like the CIA are confined to working outside U.S. borders, making it clear that the government believes the perpetrators are connected to a foreign power. The attacks also confirmed the fears that U.S. officials voiced as worries of the coronavirus spread through government in the last two weeks. ""So much focus has been on meddling in the election,"" said one senior administration official involved in cyber defense. ""The goal of [foreign attackers] is really just creating instability in society and trying to erode trust in a situation like this, to drive messages -- frequently polar opposite messages -- to incite distrust and anger."" During a congressional hearing nearly two weeks ago, a top State Department official told members of the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on Department Management that the Russians have been spreading disinformation aggressively in connection with the global pandemic. Lea Gabrielle, head of the Global Engagement Center, told senators her agency's recent analysis shows ""accounts tied to Russia, the entire ecosystem of Russian disinformation has been engaged in the midst of this world health crisis. … It's well known at this point that there are false narratives out there around coronavirus."" At the same time, China's government has been aggressively pushing propaganda that blames the West for the pandemic, though the virus was first identified in Wuhan, the capital of China's Hubei province. Officials at the federal Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency told ABC News that the government ""has taken a number of steps over the last several weeks to increase cybersecurity preparedness across federal civilian agencies, including enhanced monitoring, issuing recommendations as agencies shift to telework, and identifying and protecting particularly important systems supporting COVID response efforts,"" said spokeswoman Sara Sendek.

The suspicious activity HHS was not a hack but it may have been a distributed denial of service -- or DDOS -- attack, according to multiple sources. The distinction is important because there was no apparent breach of the HHS system, which could interfere with critical functions of the lead agency responding to the coronavirus contagion. A DDOS effort enlists automated users -- called bots -- to overwhelm a public-facing system in order to slow it down or even paralyze it. Officials believe any coordinated effort against HHS -- if there was one -- was not particularly successful and are satisfied that the system was not significantly affected. Nevertheless, the concern is that foreign actors might attempt to exploit the COVID-19 crisis to achieve some of their anti-American goals. “As federal state and local governments focus on handling the current public health crisis, national security officials are also tracking other threats -- in particular those posed by terrorist or extremist groups and foreign adversaries who may seek to take advantage of all of the attention being focused on the coronavirus and conduct an attack,” said John Cohen, a former acting Undersecretary of the Department of Homeland Security and contributor to ABC News. At this point, analysts are trying to determine the origin of the activity targeting HHS. Officials have told Congress that the intelligence community fears that entities connected to Russia would try to use the current situation to sow even more chaos in the American public. The FBI declined to comment. “We are aware of a cyber incident related to the Health and Human Services computer networks and the federal government is investigating this incident thoroughly,"" NSC spokesman John Ullyot said in the statement. ""HHS and federal government cybersecurity professionals are continuously monitoring and taking appropriate actions to secure our federal networks. HHS and federal networks are functioning normally at this time."" Intelligence and cyber officials are investigating to see if there is a connection to Sunday's messages saying there would be a national quarantine instituted, but as of now, they have not linked the two. The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), the Cyber Security arm of the Department of Homeland Security, is saying it is supporting its government partners, and is highlighting a number of steps that it's taken in previous weeks. “CISA will continue to support our partners at HHS as they protect their IT systems,"" CISA spokesperson Sara Sendek said in a statement. ""CISA has taken a number of steps over the last several weeks to increase cybersecurity preparedness across federal civilian agencies, including enhanced monitoring, issuing recommendations as agencies shift to telework, and identifying and protecting particularly important systems supporting COVID response efforts. We’re confident that the measures we’ve all put into place are sufficient, and we will stay on the lookout for and defend against malicious activity.” “HHS has an IT infrastructure with risk-based security controls continuously monitored in order to detect and address cybersecurity threats and vulnerabilities. On Sunday, we became aware of a significant increase in activity on HHS cyber infrastructure and are fully operational as we actively investigate the matter. Early on while preparing and responding to COVID-19, HHS put extra protections in place. We are coordinating with federal law enforcement and remain vigilant and focused on ensuring the integrity of our IT infrastructure, HHS spokesperson Caitlin Oakley said in a statement.

""I haven't seen any intelligence that Russia is doing anything to attempt to get President Trump reelected,"" O'Brien told ABC News Chief Anchor George Stephanopoulos on Saturday, saying it amounted to ""a non-story."" The interview came on the heels of recent reports that the Office of the Director of National Intelligence told lawmakers that Russia is meddling in the 2020 race, with a preference for the Trump campaign. O'Brien characterized the reporting on the classified briefing as ""leaks."" ""I think it's the same old story we've heard before,"" O'Brien said, adding, ""Our message to the Russians is stay out of the U.S. elections. We've been very tough on Russia and we've been great on election security."" Trump mocked reports on the intelligence community's findings during a Friday campaign rally in Las Vegas, characterizing them as a Democratic Party effort to ""start a rumor."" ""It's disinformation. That's the only thing they're good at, they're not good at anything else. They get nothing done. Do-nothing Democrats,"" he told a crowd of supporters. Stephanopoulos asked O'Brien about that characterization, and why O'Brien remained unsure of what was true regarding the new ODNI intelligence on Russia. ""Don't you have a responsibility as national security adviser to find out?"" Stephanopoulos asked. ""You're basing your assumptions, George, on leaks that came out of a House Intelligence Committee hearing,"" O'Brien said, reiterating, ""I haven't seen the intel, and I haven't seen that analysis."" ""Have you asked for it?"" Stephanopoulos pressed. ""I want to get whatever analysis they've got, and I want to make sure that the analysis is solid. From what I've heard -- again -- this is only what I've seen in the press, it doesn't make any sense,"" O'Brien said, citing what he said are conflicting interests between current U.S. foreign policy and Russia's goals. ""But look,"" O'Brien concluded, ""if there's someone from the intel community that has something different, I'd be happy to take a look at it. I just haven't seen it."" Since it was first revealed that Russia meddled in the 2016 presidential election, U.S. intelligence officials have repeatedly warned about ongoing threats by Russia to interfere in American elections, including the in 2020 presidential race. The Washington Post also reported that Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., has been briefed by U.S. officials about Russian efforts to help his Democratic primary campaign. While O'Brien called the reports about Russia's interference in favor of the Sanders ""no surprise,"" he disagreed the same could be true for the Trump campaign. O'Brien's pushback and Trump's blanket denial come as the president is acting to reshape the intelligence community, long the target of his ire. Current ambassador to Germany, and Trump loyalist, Richard Grenell has been appointed to temporarily fill the position of director of national intelligence after the president dismissed acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire earlier this week. The president is searching for a permanent director of national Intelligence, and claimed on Friday to have ""four great candidates."" O'Brien also denied reports that Trump dismissed Maguire because he was enraged and felt the briefing to the House Intelligence Committee was providing political ammunition to Democrats. ""I know again that that's not true,"" O'Brien said about the meeting when Maguire stepped down. ""I was in that meeting, and the president was not angry with Joe Maguire.""",20,,,,16

They had been rushed to the Middle East in late December to assist with regional security after protesters attacked the U.S. embassy in Baghdad. It was unclear when the remaining 2,700 soldiers who were deployed to Kuwait in the days that followed, will return to the United States as well. The bulk of the 82nd Airborne's 1st Brigade rushed from North Carolina to the region as tensions with Iran were heightened following the U.S. drone strike in January that killed a top Iranian general. ""Nearly 800 Paratroopers from the 2nd Battalion, 504th Parachute Infantry Regiment, along with members of the 3rd Squadron, 73rd Cavalry Regiment, the 3rd Battalion, 319th Airborne Field Artillery Regiment and several enabler teams from the Immediate Response Force Brigade (IRF) began their redeployment from the Middle East back to Fort Bragg, N.C.,"" according to a statement from the Army's 82nd Airborne Division. ""The remainder of the 1st Brigade Combat Team remains deployed providing support to the CENTCOM Commander for any missions deemed necessary,"" the statement continued. A complement of about 500 troops from the 82nd Airborne Division's 1st Brigade was ordered to rush to Kuwait on Dec. 31, following the storming of the outside perimeter of the U.S. embassy in Baghdad by Iranian-backed militiamen. Hundreds of these forces were surged into Baghdad as reinforcements, while hundreds of U.S. military forces serving in administrative roles were taken out of Iraq. The entire 3,500-soldier unit was ordered to Kuwait following the heightened tensions with Iran after the Jan. 2 U.S. drone strike in Baghdad that killed Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani, the top commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps' Quds Force. The drone strike led to concerns that the United States and Iran might be drawn into a regional conflict, but tensions eased following Iran's retaliatory missile strike on two bases in Iraq that housed American troops. A U.S. defense official said that the 800 troops that returned to Fort Bragg were among the first to have deployed to Iraq shortly after Iranian-backed protesters stormed the outside perimeter of the U.S. embassy in Baghdad. ""The situation is more stable,"" said the defense official when asked why the troops were returning to the United States. But the official noted that while U.S. military commanders continue to assess the Iranian threat situation in the region, it was determined that enabler units that might not be fully needed for the ongoing mission could be redeployed back to the United States. ""The deployment of the Immediate Response Force (IRF) to the U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) Area of Responsibility (AOR) was a conditions-based process intended to provide additional defensive capabilities in support of U.S. forces and interests,"" said Maj. Rob Lodewick, a Pentagon spokesperson. ""Re-deployment assessments and decisions regarding the IRF remain a similar conditions-based process,"" he added. ""As conditions in the theater continue to change, commanders constantly reassess force levels. As such, some elements of the IRF have re-deployed to their home stations in order to reset, train and re-assume their vital role in providing ready response options to contingency missions worldwide."" ""We could not be more proud of these Paratroopers and it is an honor to welcome them home,"" said Maj. Gen. James Mingus, the 82nd Airborne Division commanding general. ""These great men and women honored the tradition of Paratroopers that came before them by answering their Nation’s call on a moment’s notice."" While deployed to Kuwait the 2nd Battalion, 504th Parachute Infantry Regiment served as U.S. Central Command's Immediate Response Battalion and carried out realistic training in case they were needed elsewhere. Designed to deploy anywhere in the world within 18 hours of receiving the orders, the Immediate Response Force Brigade's deployment in January was described as the most significant no-notice deployment of combat forces in 30 years. Now, back at Fort Bragg, the unit will prepare for an upcoming exercise in Europe this spring known as Swift Response 20, the airborne portion of the larger annual Defender Europe 20 exercise that will involve other elements of the 82nd Airborne Division. This year's version of Defender Europe 20 will involve the largest deployment of U.S.-based troops to Europe for a military exercise in more than 25 years, a part of the strategic re-focus on Russia in the wake of Russia's military actions in Crimea and eastern Ukraine.",7,,,,6
2020-01-23,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/US/inside-neo-nazi-hate-group-base-center-fbi/story?id=68459758,"Inside the neo-Nazi hate group 'The Base,' which is the center of an FBI investigation","A wide-ranging domestic terrorism investigation of ""The Base,"" a militant neo-Nazi group, has culminated in the arrests of seven alleged members last week and has provided extensive new details about the inside operations of an organization that authorities say advocates for a ""violent insurgency"" to overthrow the U.S. government. The investigation comes amid an increased focus on domestic terrorism and white supremacy in the United States and fear that such groups are joining forces with like-minded individuals overseas. And it came to light in the context of a controversial Richmond, Virginia gun rally where alleged members of The Base plotted to attack police officers and civilians. According to a review of court documents released in cases out of Maryland, Georgia and Wisconsin over the past week, investigators believe the group was founded “in or around July 2018” by white nationalists who look to promote and plot acts of violence with an overarching goal of inciting a race war to create “a white ethno-state.” “Members of The Base communicate with each other through online platforms and encrypted online messaging applications and chat rooms,” FBI special agent Jessica Krueger wrote in an affidavit filed in a Wisconsin District Court last week. “In these communications, they have discussed, among other things, acts of violence against minorities (including African Americans and Jewish Americans), Base military training camps, and ways to make improvised explosive devices.” Three alleged members of the group were arrested in Maryland and Delaware on federal gun and immigration charges. Three others were arrested in Georgia on state gang charges and conspiracy to commit murder. Another man was arrested in Wisconsin and charged with conspiracy to vandalize a synagogue. According to a court filing Tuesday in Maryland, The Base’s leaders are “particularly interested in applicants with military and explosives backgrounds.” “Applicants submit an application form, which includes questions regarding the applicant’s current associations with white supremacist organizations; the applicant’s military, science, and engineering experiences and training; and the applicant’s race and gender,” the filing said. It’s not entirely clear, based on the court filings, how many followers the group has -- though investigators have identified what they say is a clear leadership structure and found that members had divided into several separate “regional chapters.” For instance, one such chapter in Wisconsin is identified as the “Great Lakes cell,” whose members organized an armed training session after passing out recruitment fliers at Marquette University in July of last year, according to the court filings. “The Base cells have a significant degree of autonomy regarding their activities, and criminal conduct is typically not centrally coordinated in order to foster “plausible deniability” among those not directly involved,” an FBI affidavit said. The FBI says it gained access to The Base’s encrypted online messaging application in July 2019, when an undercover agent participated in an online vetting interview and then personally met with members of the group in Georgia. For months, according to the FBI, the agent continued meeting and participating in weapons training exercises with three members of The Base, who were arrested on state charges last week after the agent revealed their alleged plot to assassinate two members of the radical group ‘Antifa.’ From those interactions and The Base’s online messaging, investigators say they believe members participated in such training exercises in preparation for “The Boogaloo,” a moniker that, according to the authorities, the group’s members use to “describe the collapse of the United States and subsequent race war.” One alleged member of the group arrested last week, former Canadian army reservist Patrik Mathews, had allegedly invoked ""The Boogaloo"" in connection to an attack the group planned to conduct on a pro-gun rights rally that occurred in Richmond over the weekend, according to the FBI. “You want to create f----- some instability, while the Virginia situation is happening, make other things happen, derail some rail lines… like shut down the highways… you know, you can kick off the economic collapse of the U.S. within a week, after the boog starts,” Mathews said in a conversation federal agents say was recorded in his Delaware residence. During a so-called ‘sneak-and-peek’ search of his residence prior to Mathews’ arrest, agents took pictures of items used to assemble assault rifles, “go-bags” with military-supplies like ‘Meals-Ready-To-Eat’ (MREs), and found several videos of Mathews in a gas-mask where he discussed killing people “in furtherance of the movement,” according to an FBI affidavit “If you are not getting physically fit, if you are not getting armed, if you do not acquiring weapons, ammunition, and training right… now, then you should be preparing to do what needs to be done,” Mathews said in one video, according to FBI documents. “Derail some [sic] trains, kill some people, and poison some water supplies.” A magistrate judge in Maryland ordered Mathews to remain in detention pending his trial, in which he has not yet entered a plea on federal gun and immigration charges, related to an alleged illegal entry into the U.S. At a hearing Wednesday, Matthews' lawyer defended his client. “One man’s domestic terrorist can be another man’s exercise of his First Amendment rights,” said the lawyer, Joseph Balter. “This is a very dangerous person, espousing very dangerous beliefs,” the judge said Wednesday. According to authorities, Mathews’ alleged involvement in The Base, after they say he entered the country illegally in August of last year, underscores their concerns that its influence stretches well beyond the U.S. According to court filings, investigators say the group has been “building” a coalition “within the United States and abroad” and specifically mentioned members communicating with individuals in the United Kingdom and at least one member who discussed traveling to Ukraine, “to fight with nationalists there.” Just last week, the Justice Department’s top terrorism coordinator said that the threat facing the U.S. from potential domestic terrorists is shifting in nature and becoming an increasingly transnational issue, with law enforcement seeing more Americans engaging and finding inspiration from overseas right-wing extremist groups -- in some cases even traveling abroad to meet with their members. ""This issue in many respects has become transnational in nature,"" DOJ’s counsel for domestic terrorism Thomas Brzozowski said during an event at George Washington University. ""Some folks cite one another, others gain or gather support from another, use the same contacts and techniques without any demonstrable connection that would constitute conspiracy or things of that nature.” Brzozowski specifically pointed to the neo-Nazi group Atomwaffen, whose members have traveled to train with right-wing groups in Ukraine and eastern Europe. According to prosecutors, some Atomwaffen members have also joined ranks with The Base.",20,,,,18

2020-01-17,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/pentagon-decide-troop-cut-west-africa/story?id=68342094,Pentagon to decide soon on possible troop cut in West Africa,"ABOARD A U.S. MILITARY AIRCRAFT -- A Pentagon decision that could lead to a reduction in the number of U.S. troops in West Africa could come within four to eight weeks, according to Gen. Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The possible troop cut has drawn concerns that it could come at a time when the threat in the region from violent extremist groups is growing. For months, U.S. Africa Command (AFRICOM) has been reassessing the mission priorities of the 5,200 troops currently stationed in Africa, part of a worldwide review by U.S. military commands to determine whether some missions should be cut in scope to realign their forces, resources and capabilities with the military's strategic focus on China and Russia. The main focus of AFRICOM's review has been on the hundreds of American troops operating in West Africa who are providing logistical, intelligence and special operations support to the French military mission against Islamic extremist groups operating in Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso. Once AFRICOM's review is concluded Defense Secretary Mark Esper is expected to decide whether to accept the command's recommendations that may or may not include a possible troop cut in western Africa. ""I'd expect realistically that the AFRICOM review will be over and we'll probably get secretary-level decisions -- hard decisions, my guess is -- in a month or two maybe, maximum, maybe six weeks,"" Milley told reporters with him as he flew back to the United States from Europe, where he held meetings with his NATO counterparts. News reports earlier this week that a U.S. troop withdrawal could occur sparked concerns from French officials. A French presidential source told Agence France-Presse that the U.S. made ""irreplaceable"" contributions to its operations in west Africa, particularly with intelligence gathering and mid-air refueling. ""We would not be able to get these from other partners, especially when it comes to intelligence,"" said the official, who added that France would be sharing its concerns with the U.S. ""at all levels."" Milley said the U.S. is working with the French to determine whether the level of support the U.S. is providing France is ""too much, too little, is it about right, and is it the right capabilities."" But the nation's top military officer pushed back on the notion that ""we are pulling out of Africa."" ""I think that's a mischaracterization and an overstatement,"" said Milley. ""The proper term would be economy of force, which doesn't mean zero,"" he added. ""It just means you've got to right-size it to the tasks and the threats at a level of effort that's appropriate to achieve your objectives."" As the National Defense Strategy prioritizes the U.S. military's focus on China and Russia, other geographic areas where the U.S. has operated in are becoming ""economy of force"" areas. ""Economy of force means you are going to use the least amount of force to achieve the minimum amount of objectives that you can achieve in support of the broader main effort,"" said Milley. Milley said one question being asked by military officials conducting the review is whether the U.S. should be the one providing all the military support in the region. ""We certainly have capabilities, but the question is should they be applied or not,"" said Milley. ""Maybe there are other countries that have the same types of capabilities that are not contributing that could contribute."" The majority of AFRICOM's 5,200 military personnel are serving at a base in the east African country of Djibouti where the U.S. supports Somalia's fight against the al-Qaeda affiliated al-Shabaab terror group. The U.S. military presence in western Africa had historically involved the rotation of small numbers of U.S. troops helping to train local militaries. But that all changed when France intervened in Mali in 2013 to push back Islamic extremists who seemed poised to overthrow that country's government. The United States quickly provided intelligence and logistical support to the original French mission. Since then, Africa Command has regularly deployed small teams of U.S. special operations forces to the region, primarily advising and assisting the Nigerien military. The number of American troops in western Africa peaked at 800 as the U.S. expanded a remote desert airstrip in Niger and turned it into a hub for drones used in intelligence-gathering missions around the region. But America's growing military role remained little-known until October 2017, when four U.S. Army special operations soldiers were killed in an ambush. As a result of that incident, U.S. Africa Command increased the force protection and the resourcing of American military teams operating in western Africa. U.S. Africa Command is the first of the U.S. military's regional commands to undertake the worldwide review of missions. Those responsible for South America, Europe, the Middle East and Asia will soon be undertaking their own reviews.",7,,,,6
2020-01-14,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/ukrainian-gas-firm-burisma-hacked-russians-familiar-phishing/story?id=68259768,"Ukrainian gas firm Burisma hacked by Russians in all-too-familiar phishing scheme, cybersecurity company finds","Russian government hackers successfully penetrated the internal systems of Burisma, the Ukrainian-based oil and gas firm that once employed former Vice President Joe Biden's son, a Silicon Valley-based cybersecurity company has found. Area 1, the cybersecurity outfit, issued a report detailing Russian GRU phishing efforts beginning in November 2019 aimed at ""targeting the email credentials of employees at Burisma Holdings and its subsidiaries and partners"" in an effort to ""gain control of [Burisma's] internal systems."" ""Our report is not noteworthy because we identify the GRU launching a phishing campaign, nor is the targeting of a Ukranian company particularly novel. It is significant because Burisma Holdings is publically entangled in U.S. foreign and domestic politics,"" the report's authors wrote. It’s unclear what the hackers found or what they obtained, the company said. Hunter Biden, the former vice president's son, has faced criticism for accepting a position on Burisma's board of directors. When he joined the firm in 2014, his father was fronting U.S. foreign policy toward Kyiv, and while the Bidens have not been accused of doing anything illegal, the position presented the appearance of a conflict of interest, ethics experts have told ABC News. President Donald Trump's overtures to Ukraine's leader in July to investigate the Bidens prompted Congress' impeachment probe. The Russians' phishing campaign described by Area 1 mirrors the Kremlin's efforts to penetrate Democrats leading up to the 2016 presidential election, when Russians successfully penetrated the email account of Hillary Clinton campaign adviser John Podesta through similar means. Russia has denied hacking into U.S. elections. ""The Burisma Holdings campaign is yet another example of the phishing playbook being applied to great effect,"" the authors wrote. ""The timing of the GRU's campaign in relation to the 2020 U.S. elections raises the spectre that this is an early warning of what we have anticipated since the successful cyberattacks undertaken during the 2016 U.S. elections."" Biden campaign spokesperson Andrew Bates issued a statement to ABC News late Monday about the Russian hacking of Burisma. ""This proves that both Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin understand the true stakes of this election,"" Bates said. ""Joe Biden is running to bring our country together and restore American leadership in the world -- repairing the damage Donald Trump has done to our national security and alliances. Donald Trump tried to coerce Ukraine into lying about Joe Biden and a major bipartisan, international anti-corruption victory because he recognized that he can't beat the Vice President."" ""Now we know that Vladimir Putin also sees Joe Biden as a threat,"" he continued. ""Any American president who had not repeatedly encouraged foreign interventions of this kind would immediately condemn this attack on the sovereignty of our elections."" Special counsel Robert Mueller indicted 12 Russian GRU officials for hacking the Democratic National Committee as part of his investigation into Russian meddling during the 2016 presidential election. In 2018, the Justice Department charged seven Russian GRU officials with conspiracy for allegedly hacking anti-doping agencies of the Olympic Games. On Sunday, ""This Week"" host George Stephanopoulos questioned national security adviser Robert O'Brien about the administration's preparedness for Russian meddling in the 2016 election. ""We've been very clear on our position with respect to the Russians and that's to stay out of our elections,"" O'Brien said. ""We've been very clear with the Chinese and we've been very clear with the Iranians."" Asked by Stephanopoulos to weigh in on the matter, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi cast a dimmer perspective, pointing a finger at Trump for ""jeopardizing the integrity of our elections"" by deferring to Russian President Vladimir Putin. ""The president of the United States is in complete denial about Russia's role. As I have said in terms of this president, all roads lead to Putin,"" she said. ""He said he's not going to accept the assessment of our own intelligence agencies."" Meanwhile, election security officials in the United States continue sounding alarms about the vulnerability of our election systems ""The thing I'm most worried about are a repeat of some of the types of attacks we say in 2016 against larger election infrastructure,"" said Matt Blaze, a Georgetown University Law Center professor, during a hearing before the Committee on House Administration last week. ""A determined adversary who wanted to disrupt our elections would have a frighteningly easy task.""",20,,,,29
2020-01-09,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/election-security-officials-brace-iran-cyber-retaliation/story?id=68174632,Election security officials brace for possible Iran cyber retaliation,"With tensions between Washington and Tehran on the rise, election security officials are warning of possible retaliation from Iran in the form of election meddling -- a familiar threat in the wake of Russia’s efforts in the 2016 presidential election. “The thing I’m most worried about are a repeat of some of the types of attacks we say in 2016 against larger election infrastructure,” said Matt Blaze, a Georgetown University Law Center professor, during a Thursday hearing before the Committee on House Administration. “A determined adversary who wanted to disrupt our elections would have a frighteningly easy task.” As the presidential primary season gets underway, the threat of Iranian interference highlights efforts by the federal government and states since 2016 -- when Russian hackers successfully infiltrated voting systems -- to shore up their defenses. Last week, after the death of Gen. Qassem Soleimani, the head of Iran's elite Quds Force, leaders in Tehran vowed to seek revenge. As ABC News and others have previously reported, Iran is capable of targeting a broad range of public and private institutions with cyber intrusions and attacks. State and federal leaders have already raised warnings, including West Virginia Secretary of State Mac Warner, who released a statement this week highlighting how tensions with Iran raise the stakes in securing voter systems. “The world we live in today is one where asymmetric warfare is the norm, and cyberattacks have become the weapon of choice for rogue regimes like Iran,"" Warner said. “Soleimani's death amplifies our state's preparations.” Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger echoed in a statement of his own that Iran’s “latest warning serves as a reminder that we can never lower our guard.” Neither state has reported receiving credible threats, but their statements illustrate how election security leaders are taking notice of Iran’s announced intentions to retaliate. State officials across the map have been in touch with the Department of Homeland Security's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), which convened a briefing phone call with cyber stakeholders around the country after the Soleimani strike last week. Acting Secretary of Homeland Security Chad Wolf met with CISA Director Chris Krebs on Thursday to discuss “election security and resilience” as part of the effort to defend against Iran’s potential cyber activities, according to DHS. Maria Benson, a spokeswoman with the National Association of Secretaries of State, told ABC News earlier this week that states have also been “diligently shoring up election security and defenses since 2016 against malicious actors, regardless of country.” Government officials have cited the need to coordinate with private companies who provide counties and voting districts with voting equipment to protect elections. During Thursday’s hearing before the Committee on House Administration, chiefs from the three largest private election system vendors described efforts they’ve made to “mitigate risks” from malign foreign actors to compromise their systems. “We spend great deal of time” securing systems from foreign hacks, said Tom Burt, the CEO at Election Security & Systems. “Our effort, I can honestly say, is as strong as we are capable of. We are always looking to find ways to improve and partner with other agencies improve our ability to mitigate any risks.” The cybersecurity threat in elections first emerged in 2016, when U.S. officials said Russian hackers likely targeted systems in all 50 states -- what some compared to rattling door handles -- and said that some were able to get through. In two Florida counties, for example, Russian hackers were able to successfully infiltrate voter databases. While there was no evidence any of the data was tampered with in 2016, the incident raised alarm bells with lawmakers. The Senate Intelligence Committee investigated and concluded that the “Russian movement directed extensive activity, beginning in at least 2014 and carrying into at least 2017, against U.S. election infrastructure' at the state and local level.” Since then, security officials and experts said the U.S. has made significant progress in protecting the voting process, but there's much more work to be done before Americans cast their ballots in 2020. ""There's a lot of things that keep me up at night,"" a DHS official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, told ABC News last year. ""What could our adversaries do? What could they do to undermine our democratic system?... I'll certainly be nervous but confident in the lines of communication we have and the steps that we've taken."" ABC News' Ali Dukakis and Lee Ferran contributed to this report.",20,,,,22
