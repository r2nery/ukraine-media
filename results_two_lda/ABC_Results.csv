2022-11-09,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/russia-pull-kherson-defensive-positions/story?id=93001346,Russia to pull out of Kherson to new defensive positions,"In a major setback for Russia's military operations in Ukraine, Russia's defense minister has ordered Russian troops to retreat from the key southern city of Kherson and set up defensive positions across the Dnieper River as Ukrainian troops continued with a counteroffensive targeting the city. The fighting around the city expected to continue as Russian troops move across the Dnieper River into defensive positions taking advantage of the natural border offered by the river. The retreat is a major setback for Russia's beleaguered military operations inside of Ukraine as Kherson was the largest Ukrainian city under Russian control and the only major provincial capital seized by Russian troops early in the war that is now in its eighth month. It is even more significant given that Kherson was one of the four Ukrainian provinces that had just been illegally annexed by Russia. ""I understand that this is a very difficult decision, but at the same time we will preserve the most important thing -- the lives of our servicemen and, in general, the combat effectiveness of the group of troops, which it is futile to keep on the right bank in a limited area,"" Sergeii Shoigu, Russia's defense minister said he had approved the withdrawal of Russia's troops across the Dnieper River because defending the city had become ""futile"" and very difficult to resupply. Oleksiy Arestovych, a senior Ukrainian official, described Russian forces as having been ""knocked out of Kherson."" ""The Russian army does not leave Kherson,"" he wrote on Facebook. ""It was knocked out with heavy battles, with losses methodically gnawed through the enemy’s defenses, work on crossings, hard and bloody military labor."" ""Dear people of Kherson. Here we are returning. Here you are returning. Welcome home,"" he wrote. Mykhailo Podolyak, an advisor to Ukrainian President Volodomyr Zelenskyy urged caution about the Russian announcement tweeting that ""actions speak louder than words. We see no signs that Russia is leaving Kherson without a fight."" A Russian troop withdrawal from Kherson had been telegraphed for weeks beginning with the evacuation of tens of thousands of Russian civilians from the city as Ukraine continued to target the bridges that were the main supply routes into the city across the Dnieper River. ""I found it interesting that they waited until after the election to make that judgment which we knew for some time that they were going to be doing,"" President Biden said at a White House news conference on Wednesday. ""And it's evidence of the fact that they've got some real problems, the Russian military."" ""At a minimum it will lead to time for everyone to recalibrate their positions over the winter period,"" said Biden. ""It remains to be seen whether there'll be a judgment made as to whether or not Ukraine is prepared to compromise with Russia."" Last week, a western official told reporters that it appeared that Russia was preparing for a military withdrawal from Kherson because most Russian commanders had left the city and crossed the Dnieper River, leaving behind troops that he characterized as demoralized and leaderless. On Tuesday, Brig. Gen. Patrick Ryder, the Pentagon's top spokesman told reporters that it appeared that the recent arrival of Russian troops in Kherson could mean that Russia was ""looking to defend that territory for the long term or it could be part of a rearguard action as they look to retrograde out of that area."" The western official indicated that the Russian troops that had recently arrived in the region were some of the 300,000 recently mobilized Russian reservists who were arriving in some cases only 10 to 15 days after their mobilization and were ""woefully equipped and prepared."" The official predicted that when Russia carried out a pullout from Kherson that ""we might imagine an uptick in domestic criticism of (Russian) President Putin."" Putin has previously received criticism from pro-war Russian military bloggers who have called for Russia to fully mobilize to boost the scale of its military operations inside of Ukraine. But given high Russian military casualty rates and supply line failures the western official said it would be difficult for Russia to carry out operations this winter especially when ""Russian morale is very low.""",14,,,,12
2022-11-06,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/International/foreign-fighters-ukraine-speak-willingness-serve/story?id=91671528,Foreign fighters in Ukraine speak out on their willingness to serve: 'I had to go',"When Andy Huynh watched the news of Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February, he started losing sleep. All he could think about was the struggle of the Ukrainian people against an aggressor he felt was violating their sovereignty and opening the world up to a third World War. ""All my personal problems didn't feel important anymore … It felt wrong just to sit back and do nothing,"" he said. ""I had to go."" The Alabama man was not alone. Two days after the invasion, Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called for ""friends of Ukraine, freedom and democracy"" to serve as volunteers in the Ukrainian military. More than 20,000 volunteers from 52 countries responded, many of whom had served in the U.S. Army, British Army, and, like Huynh, the U.S. Marine Corps, according to Ukrainian officials. Their experience is credited by Zelenskyy for bolstering the war effort for Ukraine, especially since NATO countries have rejected sending ground troops in fears of starting their own conflict with Russia. Russian President Vladimir Putin announced in March that 16,000 volunteers from the Middle East would be joining his country's fight. Tanya Mehra, a senior research fellow at the International Centre for Counterterrorism at The Hague, said the mobilization of foreign fighters on battlefields dates to 1816 and they have played prominent roles in conflicts in Afghanistan, Bosnia, Chechnya and Somalia since the 1980s. The evolution of foreign-born fighters has created distinct classes of fighters, from mercenaries who join conflicts primarily for financial gain, Mehra said, and others who are driven by ideological reasons. Mercenaries, she said, who are outsourced contractors for small governments, tend to be associated to ""increases in violence and higher civilian casualties,"" which can prolong the conflict, whereas foreign fighters become part of the state military, which makes them ""accountable for the acts they have committed."" Many of those foreign fighters serving in Ukraine tend to be older than your average soldier, and in a stage in their lives where they felt they could help through their years of experience. John Harding, 59, joined the Ukrainian military in 2018, when the country was fighting Russian-backed separatists. As a professional combat medic who served in Syria, the British-born Harding put his experience to use on the battlefield. But he also found he was in demand as a trainer for other medics who had no idea how to apply first aid in a hostile combat environment ""Medics are notorious for getting themselves killed,"" Harding said. ""You may know how to apply a torniquet, but you also need to know how to apply a tourniquet while watching out for snipers."" One American, who did not want to use his name because he is still fighting in Ukraine, said he joined the Ukrainian military in April because he felt ""it is important for the world to stand up with the Ukrainians and resist aggression."" Having grown up in a military family and a U.S. Air Force veteran himself, the man took leave of his job in IT while living in central Europe to join the fight. Today, he uses his background in engineering systems, cybersecurity and computer networks to operate drones in anti-tank and stinger missions. He said his squad was responsible for taking down a Mil Mi-28 Russian helicopter on July 18. The man said his homemade bombs and grenades are constructed using Coke cans and some of the 60 kilograms of TNT captured during an offensive in September. They take flight via off-the-shelf commercial drones. The man said that the number of foreign fighters he encounters, the majority of whom were from the U.S., has decreased since the spring. The intensity of the fighting weeded away what he called the ""TikTok warriors"" who were not prepared for the danger, or length, of the missions. He remains fighting after seven months because of ideological reasons, but also because of the survivor's guilt he felt when two men from his squad -- Huynh and Alex Drueke, also from Alabama -- were captured on June 9 following a firefight. ""I felt I lost my two brothers. They followed me to this unit. I felt very guilty,"" he said. ""Part of the reason I stayed this long is because of them."" Huynh and Drueke, a U.S. Army veteran, spent 105 days in captivity, including a month in a Russian ""black site,"" where they endured daily torture. In late September they were released, along with eight other foreign-born volunteer fighters from England and Canada and more than 200 Ukrainian soldiers. Harding was among those men released. He met Huynh and Drueke in a prison cell after having been captured in May when a Ukrainian unit he was with in Mariupol was forced to surrender. The torture he suffered has led to a diagnosis of permanent neurological damage to his hands, along with broken ribs and damage to his sternum. One aftereffect is ""more psychological"": ""I have mood swings which I don't have control of,"" he said. He now lives close to family in Luton, a town in the southeast of England. The results of ongoing medical treatment will determine his ability to work. ""Would I do it again? Knowing what I know, probably not. Would I do it again if I didn't know? Yes, I would,"" he said. ""The only thing I would have done different is I wouldn't have surrendered. I would have fought to the very last round."" Like Harding, Drueke and Hyunh also say they have no regrets. Back home in Alabama, they are adjusting to their former lives. Hyunh is engaged and will marry soon, while Drueke is contemplating his next career move. They have bonded, not just with one another, but with Harding and the other men in their unit who are either still in Ukraine or returned home. One day they hope to reunite, either in the U.S. or in England -- or even Ukraine itself to help rebuild. ""Honestly, Ukraine has really surprised the world. We did not expect them to be that feisty, that strong, that determined,"" said Drueke. ""They are amazing people.""",13,,,,14
2022-10-31,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/ufo-report-week-incidents-unexplained/story?id=92303931,"Another UFO report expected this week, some incidents still unexplained","The enduring debate about whether UFOs are caused by extraterrestrial beings will once again be front and center this week as U.S. intelligence agencies will provide Congress with an updated report on UFO incidents over the past year. Meanwhile, it appears that other more recent incidents are being attributed to weather balloons, other airborne clutter, and foreign surveillance, according to a U.S. official. Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines has until Monday to provide Congress with its first annual unclassified update on Unexplained Aerial Phenomena, the new term for UFOs, that includes all new UAP incidents over the past year and any previously unreported incidents. The report was required by the 2022 Defense Bill that mandated that the DNI provide an annual declassified update and a classified annex by Oct. 31 of every year through 2026. The update follows the DNI's first-ever report released in June 2022 that listed 144 UAP incidents, only one of which could be explained. At a congressional hearing earlier this year Pentagon officials said that the number of UAP incidents under investigation had risen to more than 400. While it is unclear how many new reports will be included in the upcoming update, a U.S. official told ABC News that the most recent UAP incidents can be explained as a mix of weather balloons, airborne clutter, and foreign surveillance. But the official stressed that other incidents still cannot be explained. The official added that it cannot be determined who is behind the foreign surveillance but the most likely candidates would be China and Russia since they have the most interest in monitoring the U.S. military. ""There is no single explanation that addresses the majority of UAP reports,"" Sue Gough, a Defense Department spokesperson, said in a statement. ""We are collecting as much data as we can, following the data where it leads, and will share our findings whenever possible. We will not rush to conclusions in our analysis"" ""In many cases, observed phenomena are classified as 'unidentified' simply because sensors were not able to collect enough information to make a positive attribution,"" said Gough. ""We are working to mitigate these shortfalls for the future and to ensure we have sufficient data for our analysis."" Analysis of more recent UAP incidents is helped by the amount of information and data available as compared to older incidents. The U.S. official told ABC News that two of the three videos declassified by the Pentagon in 2020 and recorded from the sensors aboard fighter aircraft now have plausible explanations. In the ""Go Fast"" video Navy pilots are heard exclaiming how fast an object is moving above the water. According to the U.S. official, the leading assessment from experts is that what the pilots saw on their video screens was actually an optical illusion of an object that was not moving very fast at all. The illusion was created by the angle and height at which the object was viewed by the sensors as it moved above the water. The ""gimbal"" video taken in 2015 by a jet fighter crew that shows an object rotating in the clouds. The official says it's now believed that the object's strange movements and observed spinning was caused by the sensor aboard the plane that captured that image. There is no assessment for what is being seen in the third video commonly referred to as the ""Flir"" video that was taken in 2004. The general public's appetite for UFOs is sure to continue, and just last week NASA announced the 16 people who would serve on a new panel tasked with studying UAPs. Their report, based on unclassified information, is slated to be released in mid-2023. ..",3,,,,8
2022-10-24,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/International/top-ukrainian-general-discusses-war-russia-putins-nuclear/story?id=91989074,"Top Ukrainian general discusses war against Russia, Putin's nuclear threat: Exclusive","KHARKIV, Ukraine -- The commander of the Ukrainian Ground Forces warned that Russian President Vladimir Putin's threat to use nuclear weapons in Ukraine is real and that the West ""should be worried,"" but said his country is nonetheless winning the war. Gen. Col. Oleksander Syrskiy made the comments in an exclusive interview with ABC News' Chief Foreign Correspondent Ian Pannell in the eastern Ukrainian city of Kharkiv on Sunday. As the 57-year-old top commander of his country's land forces, Syrskiy has played a decisive role in turning the war in Ukraine's favor, first leading the successful defense of the capital, Kyiv, and then -- most recently -- masterminding the spectacular counteroffensive in the northeast that upended the monthslong conflict and threw Russian forces onto the defensive. The rare interview, airing Monday on ""Good Morning America,"" is one of the few times Syrskiy has spoken publicly at length and he described Ukraine's tactics, the importance of Western support, the threat of renewed attacks from Belarus and his determination that Ukraine will reclaim all of its territory, including the Moscow-annexed Crimean Peninsula. Ukraine's successes, however, have been shadowed by the recent threats from Putin that Russia might resort to nuclear weapons to reverse the course of his war in Ukraine. Syrskiy told ABC News that he takes the threats seriously. ""We are and should be worried,"" Syrskiy said. ""I do believe that such a threat really exists and we have to take it into account."" The urgency of those worries was underlined on Sunday when Russian Minister of Defense Sergey Shoigu made telephone calls to his counterparts in France, Turkey, the United Kingdom and the United States, alleging that Ukraine was preparing to use a ""dirty bomb"" on its own territory. Shoigu's claim sparked fears that Russia might be laying the groundwork to use a nuclear weapon and blame Ukraine for it. Following Shoigu’s call with U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III, White House National Security Council spokesperson Adrienne Watson dismissed the allegations as ""transparently false."" ""The world would see through any attempt to use this allegation as a pretext for escalation,"" Watson said. Russia's nuclear threats have grown louder as its position in Ukraine has become increasingly desperate, and Ukrainian troops now threaten to force the Russians to retreat from the key port city of Kherson -- yet another potential turning point in the war. Syrskiy is one of the minds behind the two crucial victories so far that have enabled Ukraine's stunning success in pushing back Russian forces. When Russian troops advanced on Kyiv in late February, shortly after launching the invasion of neighboring Ukraine, Syrskiy directed the defense that shattered Putin’s initial objectives. Then in September, Syrskiy led the counteroffensive in northeastern Ukraine that liberated thousands of miles of Russian-occupied territory -- a disaster for Moscow that forced Putin to order a military draft and, for the first time, raised the prospect that Russian forces might suffer a full defeat in Ukraine. ""Of course I think we are winning,"" Syrskiy told ABC News. ""Because, first and foremost, we are winning the psychological battle."" But the commander warned against complacency, noting the heavy sacrifices that success has required of Ukrainians. ""We have success on the battleground, but war is difficult,"" he added. ""There hasn't been any wars at that scale in Europe, or elsewhere in the world, since the Second World War. And we understand that this war is about survival of our people and our state, and this is why we have no other option but to win."" Syrskiy was given the Hero of Ukraine award in April for his efforts defending the capital city. But the victory in Kharkiv, his hometown, was especially personal. Cerebral and reflective, Syrskiy is also a military leader who prefers to see the frontlines himself, regularly visiting positions to personally meet some of the soldiers he is sending into battle. He told ABC News he feels that responsibility and has a ""spiritual connection"" with his troops. Although he was appointed to his current post in 2019, Syrskiy has helped lead Ukraine's defense against Russia since 2014, when Russian troops and separatist proxies seized parts of the disputed Donbas region, the predominately Russian-speaking industrial heartland of Ukraine's east. Syrskiy has a deep familiarity with the tactics of his enemy, having been trained in the same Soviet school of warfare. In the 1980s, he studied at the Moscow Higher Combined Arms Command School. Now, he's exploiting that knowledge on the battlefield. ""It's easier to understand your enemy's actions,"" he told ABC News. ""You can foresee what he might do in different situations."" But as a commander, like the rest of Ukraine's military leadership, Syrskiy has embraced a different mode of military thinking since even before 2014 -- adopting NATO doctrines that grant greater initiative to more junior officers on the ground and moving away from the top-down Soviet approach. ""Of course there was a change in mentality,"" he said. ""Understanding that victory is achieved not by increasing the number of troops, but by using them smartly."" Despite his familiarity with Russia, Syrskiy said he had not believed Moscow would go through with a full-scale invasion. Even as Russian forces massed near the border, he said he believed an attack would be limited to the east, though he still prepared for the worst. ""To be honest, I did not expect that scale and level of invasion from the enemy,"" he told ABC News. Now fighting in Donbas, Syrskiy said Ukraine's strategy was to avoid full-frontal clashes that favoured Russia's massed artillery and instead, steadily degrade Russia's firepower by hitting supply hubs while launching constant mobile attacks. The goal, he said, was to achieve objectives with minimal losses. ""We achieve this by reliably hitting the firepower of the enemy, their artillery, avoiding frontal assaults, emphasizing raids and manoeuvers, attacking from the flanks and from the back,"" he added. ""We create the conditions under which we can make the enemy nervous, start taking losses and abandon their positions."" The successful counteroffensive in the northeast led by Syrskiy has been hailed by military experts as a masterstroke that will go down in the history of warfare, alongside other victorious operations like the D-Day landings during World War II or the Battle of Saratoga in the American Revolutionary War. Ukraine's success relied on patience and misdirection, declaring a counteroffensive in its south over the summer which lured Russia into pulling some of its best troops from the northeastern frontline. Once Russia had thinned its defenses in the northeast, Ukraine struck, rapidly breaking through and causing Russia's lines to collapse. Initially, the northeastern counteroffensive had itself been planned as a feint to tie up Russian units, according to Syrskiy. But he said he realized while planning the operation that Russian forces there were weaker than expected, opening up an opportunity to deliver a blow that would have a much wider effect. ""When we were planning it, it became obvious to me that an advance in Kharkiv as an operation will benefit us most and will have the most negative impact on the enemy,"" Syrskiy told ABC News. ""I noticed it first in May during the first offensive operation around Kharkiv, when we managed to liberate 10 to 30 kilometers of areas surrounding the city,"" he added, before noting that it was only in the summer that the change in the balance in forces made the counteroffensive possible. A similar Ukrainian success now looks possible in Kherson. Russia has ordered all civilians to leave the southern city amid reports it has already pulled back some veteran troops. But there are also concerns Russia might blow up the nearby Kakhovka hydroelectric dam, which Ukrainian officials allege Russian troops have rigged with explosives, threatening to flood Kherson. Syrskiy declined to comment on the battle for Kherson, saying only that he believes ""in the success of our armed forces."" He said the threat Russia might also blow up the Kakhovka dam should also not be underestimated. There is also renewed concern around neighboring Belarus, from where Russia launched its failed assault on Kyiv and where it has recently again begun moving in more troops and equipment. Western and Ukrainian officials have said that, for now, the new build up in Belarus is small and more likely a feint aimed at drawing Ukrainian troops away from the south. But Syrksiy said he believes the Russian moves in Belarus do reflect preparations to try to move the fighting into new areas once again. ""Of course they are getting ready for escalation of the battle and switching the conflict to other combat zones,"" he told ABC News. ""They are getting ready for action aimed at weakening our groupings and, to my mind, the possible purpose of that would be to cut or degrade our lines of communication and supplies."" But he said by doing so, Russia again risks stretching itself too thin in the north. ""They risk stepping on the same rake twice and hitting themselves in the face,"" he added. Most experts believe Putin is preparing for a long war, hoping his military mobilization and the arrival of winter weather will allow Russia to stablize its frontlines and then outlast Western determination to support Ukraine. The possibility of Republicans taking control of the U.S. Congress in the midterm elections next month is also raising questions whether American aid will continue as strongly for Ukraine. Republicans are divided on the issue and some party leaders have suggested they might scale aid back. When asked if he was worried that U.S. support could dry up if Republicans win more seats in Congress, Syrskiy said he doesn't get involved in politics. ""I trust the government. I trust the people of the United States of America. I trust that our strategic partner will continue to help us overcome our enemy come what may,"" he said. Syrskiy said he was grateful to the American people for the aid, which he said played a key role in Ukraine's victories. Without U.S. weapons and ammunition, he said he couldn't even imagine how much harder the task would be. When asked whether he believes Putin would stop if Ukraine succeeded in liberating all its territory, Syrskiy said it doesn't matter and that the fastest way to end the war was for Ukraine to push Russia out as quickly as possible. ""We have no other option, we have to go forward, move straight to our state borders,"" he said, adding that victory would only be when Ukrainian flags were flying over all Ukraine's borders, ""including Ukrainian Crimea."" Syrskiy recalled seeing razed villages last week as he drove near the recently liberated city of Lyman in northeastern Ukraine's Donetsk Oblast. ""You can't look at these scenes without getting emotional,"" he told ABC News. ""You literally feel pain in my heart, in my soul, so certainly you want to deliver such a blow to the enemy that they can never get back to Ukraine.""",14,,,,12
2022-10-24,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/International/satellite-photos-reveal-fortification-plans-russia-occupied-ukraine/story?id=91734319,Satellite photos reveal fortification plans in Russia-occupied Ukraine: Analysts,"LONDON -- As it looks ahead to a decisive winter, Russia is constructing a massive fortification in the eastern Ukrainian territory it occupies, according to satellite imagery and statements by a key ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin. Satellite imagery provided by Planet Labs shows significant work is underway to build a trench in Russian-occupied eastern Ukraine, with a planned length of some 120 miles. In satellite images taken on Oct. 17, the fortifications for this defensive line begin just south of Russian-held Popasna in the Luhansk region. An ABC News analysis of the satellite images overlaid on Google Earth suggests the fortifications, as of that date, were 7.9 miles long. Another section of fortifications, near the town of Hirske, can be seen on satellite imagery from Oct. 6. The image shows two rows of pyramid-shaped concrete blocks followed by a large vehicle-trapping ditch, both meant to slow down tanks and heavy machinery. An analyst for Janes, the defense intelligence provider, told ABC News the trenches “are considerably larger and more sophisticated than most Russian trench lines seen throughout the war."" The trench is being dubbed ""The Wagner Line"" in Russian media after the Russian private military company of the same name. Wagner’s founder, billionaire Evgeniy Prigozhin, told Russian media outlet New Day that Wagner was behind the project. Plans for the trench published by a Prigozhin-linked media outlet, FAN, show it will extend to Lysychansk to the north before turning and going east toward the Russian border. Completed according to this plan, it would run about 120 miles. The Janes analyst says this is an ambitious plan. ""It will take the Russians considerable time to construct it if they try to, and it’s time they may well not have,” given Ukraine’s offensive in the east. Even so, the Russians are using what the military analysts said are rare and expensive trench-digging systems, seen in videos published by FAN, to build it. This could mean ""the towns near these trenches are considered to be important enough by Russian commanders to merit their use."" The plan for the completed line goes through towns that the Janes analyst describes as strategic hubs important to Russia’s long-term goals in the region: Popasna, Severodonetsk and Lysychansk and Luhansk. But by protecting these towns, the line would actually bisect the Luhansk oblast, all of which Russia currently holds, staying instead within the borders of the Luhansk People’s Republic, the Russian-backed separatist republic within the oblast, the experts said. Colonel Serhiy Cherevatyi, spokesman for Ukraine's Eastern Command, sees this as proof that the war is not going Russia’s way. ""It is the evidence of their losses as they proclaimed both Luhansk and Donetsk oblasts in general as Russia and here, in the middle of this territory they are building this fortified line,"" Cherevatyi told ABC News. And while the Wagner Line may be a defensive tool, Cherevatyi suspects there is a political reason for it as well. ""it looks as if they want to demonstrate how important it is for them, that they will stand till the end defending these territories.""

2022-10-20,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/google-sees-chinese-iranian-hacking-election-cycle/story?id=91761304,"Google sees less Chinese and Iranian hacking this election cycle, they say","Just weeks away from the 2022 midterm elections, a senior Google official said Wednesday that the company hasn't seen the same style of hacking from groups backed by the governments of China and Iran as during the 2020 election. Speaking with reporters, Shane Huntley, the senior director Google's Threat Analysis Group, compared the current level of activity to past reports from the company that Chinese and Iranian actors targeted email accounts related to the campaigns for then-candidate Joe Biden and then-President Donald Trump in 2020. ""We haven't seen that this year,"" Huntley said. ""We're watching very closely.” ""It's so far relatively quiet on the hacking front,” he said. But, he added, outside groups remained focused on disinformation: ""There's a lot happening behind the scenes, but we haven't seen that sort of cyberattack nature that we've sort of have seen in previous years.” During the 2020 campaign, Google went public with what it said were documented attempts by Chinese and Iranian hackers to to compromise email accounts for Biden and Trump campaign staff. The efforts appeared to be unsuccessful -- but were a part of what federal government officials described then as ongoing attempts by foreign countries to interfere in domestic elections. (Both China and Iran have in the past denied accusations of cyberattacks on U.S. entities.) Of election security, Google's Huntley said Wednesday that major efforts were being made regarding that and disinformation. Google officials on Wednesday also offered a broader look at personal cyber security. Heather Adkins, Google's vice president of security engineering, told reporters that in the next five to 10 years, “We will see the death of the password.” She added that Google would continue to iterate on things like “security keys, passkeys that the authentication experience.” In May, Apple, Google and Microsoft announced a joint effort to expand support for passwordless sign-in across devices and platforms. “The reality is that everyone's gonna get hacked at some point,"" Adkins said. ""And the differentiator will become how quickly we recover from that. And you actually see that in Ukraine.” Noting the cyberattack on the American satellite company Viasat in the early days of Russia's attack on Ukraine, earlier this year, Adkins said the firm was “actually able to recover very quickly, quickly enough to put their feet back on the ground and then resist the invasion.” Huntley, the security official, said that Google has been able to to help Ukraine and Ukrainian government officials protect themselves amid the conflict, thus allowing the Eastern European nation to “take direct actions because we were actually able to help out.”",3,,,,11
2022-10-12,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/International/deadly-russian-strikes-ukraine-sign-weakness-strength-analysts/story?id=91296759,"Deadly Russian strikes on Ukraine sign of weakness, not strength: Analysts","Russia’s missile strikes across Ukraine on Monday were a direct retaliation for the attack damaging the key bridge connecting Crimea with Russia, Russian President Vladimir Putin said this week. The bombardment was the largest against Ukrainian cities in months and focused heavily on civilian targets, killing at least 19 and injuring dozens more, Ukrainian officials said. It was also the first time the very center of Kyiv had been directly hit. But while the barrage was intended to terrorize, independent analysts said it underlined not Russia’s strength but growing weakness, illustrating its inability to shift the military situation in its favor. They called it a desperate attempt by Russian President Vladimir Putin to respond to critics at home but said the strikes would have no effect in reversing Russia's battlefield defeats. ""This is not, therefore, a new war-winning strategy but a ... tantrum,"" Lawrence Freedman, a professor of War Studies at Kings College London, wrote in a post his Substack blog of Monday’s strikes. The Crimean bridge that was partially collapsed by a blast over the weekend was a target with major symbolic and military significance for Russia. The bridge was an expensive physical symbol of Putin’s annexation of Crimea and a key supply line for Russian forces already under intense pressure in southern Ukraine. The attack on the bridge was a personal humiliation for Putin that underscored how badly the war is going for Russia. Russian nationalists were demanding a commensurate response, experts said. Russia's strikes on Monday were unable to hit anything comparable, instead resorting to bombing civilian targets without any military significance, including a university and a children’s playground in Kyiv, local officials said. ""The occupiers are not capable of opposing us on the battlefield already, that is why they resort to this terror,"" Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in a social media post on Monday. In the capital, for example, a Russian missile targeted a pedestrian bridge that crosses through a park and that’s only used for sightseeing. The missile missed the bridge, leaving it intact, but it did hit the surrounding park. It's unclear if that strike resulted in any injuries. Russia also targeted several power stations around the country that Ukrainian and Western officials have said are part of a strategy of destroying heating infrastructure as winter approaches. The strikes are designed to spread fear, but will have no impact on Ukraine’s ability to keep advancing in the northeast and south where Russia is on the defensive, several military analysts said. Russia is also running out of the long-range missiles it used in Monday’s strike, meaning it will be unable to maintain such intensity even short-term, analysts said. Pavel Luzhin, a military expert and political scientist, told the Russian independent news site The Insider that after Monday’s strikes, Russia already had insufficient advanced missiles to repeat such a large-scale attack. ""The 83 missiles that Russia used today, it had been hoarding for several months,” Luzhin, who writes for Riddle Russia, told The Insider. Russia produces no more than 200 advanced cruise missiles a year, he said, and upping production or buying them from other countries was impossible. Luzhin said Russia still had larger quantities of older, less advanced missiles and now Iranian drones, but these were not enough to have a significant military impact. ""Enough for terror, but not for anything more,"" he said. White House spokesman John Kirby said in an interview on ""Good Morning America"" on Tuesday that Russia’s bombing campaign across Ukraine didn’t appear to be enough to turn the military tide in Russia’s favor. ""It doesn't appear like they're going to do that,"" Kirby said. ""I mean, we don't know what the next steps here are for Mr. Putin. But you can see just from the--just from the reaction of the Ukrainian people over the course of the weekend, they're not backing down. They're not slowing down. They're gonna continue to conduct their counteroffensives. They are still active on the battlefield."" Greg Yudin, a professor of political philosophy at the Moscow School of Social and Economic Sciences, told ABC News the Russian hardliners were ""the target audience"" for Monday’s strikes. He said Putin was now fully aligned with the hardliners and that he would escalate further despite his military’s growing weakness. ""He doesn’t care about reality. He will push until the end. He will escalate further and further, hoping that perhaps the final escalation will make the opponent surrender,” Yudin said. He said, in Putin’s view, the real opponent he must force to surrender was the West. ""The hardliners have been demanding attacks on Ukrainian infrastructure for some time and they now have got what they wanted. But they will inevitably be disappointed with the results. The electricity will be turned back on, the rubble cleared, and Ukraine’s armies will continue to press forward,” Freedman wrote in a post on his Substack. Russia has been bombing Ukrainian infrastructure since the start of the war, hitting Ukrainian cities most days, but the number of its strikes has fallen dramatically since the summer, which is a sign it has to ration its limited missile stockpile, most military experts say. Short on missiles and pushed back from Ukrainian cities, Russia is often turning to anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles to strike ground targets in order to preserve its more valuable cruise missiles, experts said. Ukraine is also increasingly effective at shooting down Russian missiles. One of Britain’s top spy chiefs on Tuesday also said Russia was increasingly short on ammunition and supplies of all types. ""We know — and Russian commanders on the ground know — that their supplies and munitions are running out,"" Sir Jeremy Fleming, the head of Britain’s GCHQ intelligence will say in a speech he is expected to give Tuesday, the BBC and other media outlets reported. “Russia’s forces are exhausted. The use of prisoners to reinforce, and now the mobilization of tens of thousands of inexperienced conscripts, speaks of a desperate situation.” As Ukraine has routed Russian forces in parts of the country in recent weeks, hardline nationalists in Russia have been calling for Putin to adopt a total war approach that would destroy civilian infrastructure and flatten Ukrainian cities. On Monday some of those critics hailed the strikes. ""We must hope that this is not a one-time act of revenge but a new system of waging war,"" Alexander Kots, a prominent military reporter for the pro-Kremlin Komsomolskaya Pravda newspaper, wrote on the social media platform Telegram. ""Across the entire Ukrainian government. Until they lose the ability to function."" The Kremlin last week appointed a new overall commander for its Ukrainian operations, Gen. Sergey Surovikin, known for leading a brutal indiscriminate bombing campaign in Syria. Monday’s strikes may suggest the Kremlin may be shifting to a similar strategy of intensifying attacks on civilians in the hope of counterbalancing its military’s failures while also placating its most aggressive supporters, experts said. In a short speech on Monday, Putin said the strikes were in response to the Crimean bridge explosion and warned Ukraine more would come if it repeated similar attacks. “No one should have any doubts about that,” Putin said. But Ukrainian officials said the threats would not intimidate them, noting Russia has barraged the country since February and instead calling for western countries to provide more air defenses. Kyiv has pleaded for such defenses for months, and Zelenskyy did so again Tuesday at the G7 meeting. ""I thank you for all the help already provided. It is big, it is significant,"" Zelenskyy said Tuesday. ""But the Russian leader, who is now in the final stage of his reign, still has room for further escalation. This possibility of his is a threat to all of us."" Zelenskyy told the G7 that air defense systems are critical for peace to be achieved in his country. ""We have a formula for peace. And now, reacting to Russian terror, sham referenda and the attempt to annex our territory, we can apply the peace formula so that the terrorist state stands no chance,"" he said. ""The first point is defense support. Air shield for Ukraine. This is part of the security guarantees that are an element of our peace formula,"" Zelenskyy said Tuesday. ""When Ukraine receives a sufficient number of modern and effective air defense systems, the key element of Russian terror - missile strikes - will cease to work."" In a phone call on Monday with Zelenskyy, President Joe Biden pledged to continue support, including “advanced air defense systems.” The United States announced in July it would provide two NASAMS surface-to-air defense systems, although they have not yet arrived. Kirby wouldn't provide any more details on what more, in terms of air defense systems, the U.S. may provide Ukraine. ""Clearly, air defense is a need, and we're going to work with them on that going forward,” he told ""GMA"" on Tuesday, adding: “Clearly, after this weekend, air defense capabilities continue to be a significant need for Ukraine.""",14,,,,2
2022-10-11,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/International/ukrainian-officials-tech-companies-send-drones-front-line/story?id=91287422,"Ukrainian officials, tech companies to send more drones to the front line","LVIV, Ukraine -- Ukrainian and foreign tech companies are providing an array of tech and cyber support to Ukraine in its fight against Russia, Ukrainian officials and tech experts said, with some the country’s top commanders saying they plan to buy about 1,000 more drones. “Ukraine needs all the categories of drones: huge ones, small ones, kamikaze drones,” Ivan Tolchynskyi, CEO of Atlas Aerospace, a compact drone manufacturer, said at a conference in Lviv this month. The Ukrainian Ministry of Digital Transformation along with the General Staff said this month that they’d spend almost $500,000 to buy about 1,000 drones. Small drones have become popular in Ukraine “because every soldier probably wants to get their own drone on the battlefield,” Tolchynskyi added. His company has provided the Ukrainian army with about 150 drones and plans to increase the number of deliveries to “1000 by the end of this year.” Ukraine's cause is also boosted by non-combat drones and special equipment, such as the mine-detection technology and medical drones supplied to various NGOs by the Canadian company Draganfly. “We originally came to Ukraine with our medical response drone that carries about 30 pounds of temperature sensitive supplies - such as insulin or pharmaceuticals - for search and rescue battlefield missions,” Cameron Chell, president and CEO of Draganfly, said. While drones help defend Ukraine's skies and territory, the country also needs solid protection in cyberspace to repel attacks by Russian hackers. “On average, we register around 200 attacks every day. Sometimes it is 500 a day and sometimes it is 50, but it happens every day,” Oleksandr Bornyakov, Deputy Minister of Digital Transformation, said. “We may not see it, we may not know what is really going on behind the scenes,” Kim Zetter, a cybersecurity journalist, added. Yet according to NATO Cyber Defense Center Ambassador Kenneth Gears, “[W]e have probably seen what Russia has.” As troops in the battlefield don’t do anything without hacker support these days, Gears said, the “very poor results that we see on the battlefield from the Russian army are in part the result of failed cyber-attacks and cyber defenses of the Russian army.” But in Ukraine, the IT sector -- and cyber warfare -- seems to be thriving, industry officials said. “The IT industry is one of the most resilient industries in Ukraine right now, maybe the most resilient. We are able to perform very efficiently during these times,” Vitaly Sadler, CEO and co-founder of Intellias, an IT development company, said. Ukraine boasts an informal “IT army” -- a gathering of over 200,000 anonymous volunteers who are coordinating via the Telegram messaging app. This motley crew of 'hackers' performed online attacks on very sensitive Russian targets, targeting banks, civil aviation databases and even the Federal Security Service website. Ukraine may even conscript a few IT specialists fleeing Russia on the back of the partial military mobilization announced by Moscow on Sept. 21, said Oleksandr Bornyakov, the deputy minister of Digital Transformation, adding that the recruitment is likely going to be limited. “I don’t think Ukrainian society is ready to accept even 'good Russians.' We might consider this on a very personal basis after conducting complete research on each person,” Bornyakov said. Russian hackers are in a more vulnerable position once they leave Russia. “Right now, they are protected by the Russian government -- the NSA and the U.S. cyber command know many of them. And Russia is going to be focused primarily on its own defense,"" he said.",14,,,,4
2022-10-11,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/International/russia-desperate-position-uk-spy-chief/story?id=91323871,"Russia in 'desperate' position, UK spy chief says","LONDON -- Russia is in a “desperate” position in its war in Ukraine and is running out of weapons and allies, according to the U.K.’s Director of GCHQ Jeremy Fleming. “We believe that Russia is running short of munitions, it’s certainly running short of friends … Russia and Russia’s commanders are worried about the state of their military machine,” Fleming said in an interview with the BBC News on Tuesday morning. “The word I’ve used is ‘desperate.’ We can see that desperation at many levels inside Russian society and inside the Russian military machine,"" said Fleming, whose British Government Communications Headquarters has a mission similar to the U.S. National Security Agency. Fleming gave the interview ahead of a speech he was schedule to give to a London think tank Tuesday, in which he was expected to be highly critical of the Russian military’s performance in the nearly eight-month-long war. “Far from the inevitable Russian military victory that their propaganda machine spouted, it's clear that Ukraine’s courageous action on the battlefield and in cyberspace is turning the tide,” Fleming said in his prepared remarks, adding that, “The costs to Russia -- in people and equipment are staggering. We know -- and Russian commanders on the ground know -- that their supplies and munitions are running out.” Russian President Vladimir Putin has ordered a series of missile strikes across Ukraine in the last 48 hours in retaliation for an attack on the strategically important Kerch bridge into Crimea over the weekend, with Fleming arguing this will have depleted their dwindling arsenal. “Russia, as we’ve seen in the dreadful attacks yesterday, still has a very capable military machine. It can launch weapons, it has deep, deep stocks and expertise. And yet, it is very broadly stretched in Ukraine,” he told the BBC. He also took aim at Putin’s leadership: “With little effective internal challenge, his decision-making has proved flawed. It’s a high stakes strategy that is leading to strategic errors in judgement. Their gains are being reversed.” “And the Russian population has started to understand that too, “ he added. “They’re seeing just how badly Putin has misjudged the situation. They’re fleeing the draft, realizing they can no longer travel. They know their access to modern technologies and external influences will be drastically restricted. And they are feeling the extent of the dreadful human cost of his war of choice.”",14,,,,4
2022-10-10,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/International/inside-ukraines-counteroffensive-drone-warfare-small-group-hackers/story?id=91104098,Inside Ukraine's critical drone warfare campaign against Russia,"In a workshop in an undisclosed location in the southern Ukrainian city of Zaporizhzhia, a group of IT experts and engineers are assembling plastic components and soldering electrical wires. Bartek Kowalski from Poland, the only overseas member of an otherwise all-Ukrainian team, modestly joked that the intricate task he is performing can be learned by ""watching YouTube tutorials."" But the work of these volunteers is no laughing matter. They take drones that can be purchased on the internet and adapt them into fighting machines for the Ukrainian military. A custom-made fitting, designed in their lab, which is fixed onto the underside of a drone can carry a grenade that can then be dropped onto Russian positions. At the end of August, the Ukrainian military announced it was launching a counteroffensive in the south of the country. And, this week, Ukrainian forces appeared to be gaining significant amounts of ground in the Kharkiv region in the northeast. Yevhen Tkach is a biologist by trade who now spends the bulk of his time managing volunteer efforts to procure, adapt and supply drones to Ukrainian military units. He said he regularly receives information from military colleagues confirming the positive impact drones are making in the Ukrainians' ongoing operations to recapture territory. As well as their work to attach grenades to drones, Tkach and his colleagues are also taking other types of drones, and attaching explosives to them so they can be flown directly into a target in a kamikaze-style attack. His team is also working to fit certain drones with thermal cameras because a lot of the work undertaken by reconnaissance and sabotage units along the frontlines in Ukraine is carried out at night. As Yevhen Tkach pointed out, a drone is nowhere near as valuable as the life of a soldier, so the machines can access dangerous areas, acting as the military's ""eyes in the sky."" And he acknowledges that the Russians are ""really good at electronic warfare."" With the war in Ukraine predominantly an artillery battle, drones gather vital intelligence, allowing a unit to pinpoint enemy positions and assets. The location of any target is then passed to artillery units. However, soldiers who pilot drones are sometimes targets themselves. Before Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in late February, Oleksandr Trofymenko was an event manager in Denmark. He quickly returned to his native Ukraine and now serves alongside a former farmer, DJ and security guard in a Ukrainian drone reconnaissance unit based in Zaporizhzhia. Trofymenko and his colleagues are heavily armed and alive to the risks they face. ""As soon as we launch the drone the Russians are hunting for us,"" he said with a wry smile. Defending their own territory, he argues, gives units like his an obvious advantage. ""We know everything,"" about the terrain, he said. Trofymenko is grateful to the army of Ukrainian volunteers who support units like his with vital equipment and even weapons. Yevhen Tkach and his small group of engineers in Zaporizhzhia also hack the drones before they supply them to reconnaissance units for use on the battlefield. By hacking a drone, they rid it of any digital signature which could reveal a unit's location to the Russians. Holding his drone aloft, soldier Trofymenko confidently states that the Russians can't see it. ""This is the work of Ukrainian engineers,"" he said.",14,,,,18
2022-09-26,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/International/13-killed-russian-school-shooting/story?id=90518338,At least 17 killed in Russian school shooting,"At least 17 people, including 11 children, were killed after a man opened fire at a school in central Russia on Monday, officials said. Local authorities said at least 24 more people were injured, some severely, in the attack in the school in the city of Izhevsk about 600 miles from Moscow, making it one of the deadliest school shootings Russia has suffered. Twenty-two children were among the two dozen injured in the shooting. Two teachers and two security guards were among the dead, according to the region's governor. Police said the alleged shooter killed himself at the school following the attack. They identified him as a 34-year-old former student at the school. Russia's Investigative Committee, which handles serious crimes, identified him as Artyem Kazantsev, and posted a video it said showed his body lying in a pool of blood in a classroom. The motive for the attack was still unclear but the committee said it was investigating possible ""neofascist views"" held by the shooter, who in the video it released appeared to be wearing a T-shirt with a red swastika. President Vladimir Putin's spokesman called the shooting a ""terrorist act."" ""President Putin grieves in connection with the deaths of people and children in the school, where the terrorist act occurred. It was carried out by an individual who, judging by everything, belongs to a neofascist organisation or group,"" Dmitry Peskov, Putin's press secretary told reporters. The shooting began mid-morning, while children were in class. Video circulating in Russian media showed pupils cowering under desks and with blood stains visible on the floor. Police sealed off the school and emergency services could be seen carrying stretchers with the wounded from the building. The shooter was armed with two pistols, according to Alexander Khinstein, the chairman of Russia's parliamentary committee for information policy, technology and communications. School shootings have been relatively rare in Russia, but in recent years they have become increasingly frequent. In May 2021, a teenager killed seven children and two adults after attacking a school in Kazan, and in April this year a man shot two children and a teacher dead at a kindergarten in the Ulyanovsk region. An 18-year-old student killed 21 people and wounded dozens more after setting off a bomb in a polytechnic college in Kerch in occupied Crimea in 2018.",17,,,,24
2022-09-21,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/International/russia-releases-americans-captured-fighting-ukraine/story?id=90272604,Russia releases 2 Americans captured fighting in Ukraine,"Two Americans who were being held captive by Russian-backed forces after volunteering to fight with Ukrainian forces have been released, their families said. Alexander Drueke and Andy Huynh, both military veterans from Alabama, were reported missing by their families following a fight in the Kharkiv area of Ukraine in June. They are currently in the custody of the U.S. Embassy in Saudi Arabia, their families announced in a joint statement on Wednesday. ""We are thrilled to announce that Alex and Andy are free,"" the families said. ""They are safely in the custody of the US embassy in Saudi Arabia and after medical checks and debriefing they will return to the States."" ""We deeply appreciate everyone's prayers and especially the close communication and support of our elected officials, Ukrainian Ambassador Markarova, and our members of the US embassies in Ukraine and Saudi Arabia and the US Department of State,"" the statement continued. The Saudi Ministry of Foreign Affairs said Wednesday that ""mediation efforts"" on behalf of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman led to the release of 10 prisoners of war -- among them U.S. nationals -- as part of an exchange between Russia and Ukraine. The prisoners of war also included Moroccan, U.K., Swedish and Croatian nationals, the ministry said. Rep. Robert Aderholt, R-Ala., said in a statement that his office is working to get more information from the U.S. State Department on the health of the men and how soon they will be back in the U.S. ""I want to say how thankful and relieved I am that they have been freed,"" he said. ""I know we all look forward to seeing them back safely, on American soil."" Drueke's family told ABC News they were able to speak with Drueke on the phone for about 10 minutes on Wednesday from Saudi Arabia, during which Drueke said he and Huynh were at a hospital being evaluated and were then going to be taken to an apartment to sleep. Drueke, an Army veteran, and Huynh, a former Marine, both left Alabama for Ukraine in April and met there. After their families reported that they had lost contact with them in early June, photos started appearing online via Ukrainian and Russian social media that showed the men in captivity. Russian state-controlled news outlets also released videos of the two men in captivity. During calls with his family, Drueke read statements that identified his captors as forces from the Donetsk People's Republic, a Russian-backed region in Ukraine, his family said. The Kremlin claimed that the Americans were mercenaries and had ""committed crimes."" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy had previously called both men ""heroes"" and said he would fight for their release. ""We'll fight for them and get them back, and of course they will come back to their families,"" he said in June. A senior State Department official told ABC News their freedom is the result of months of negotiations by Ukraine, and in recent weeks the U.S. had been pushing Kyiv to include the Americans in their dealings. The official confirmed Prince Mohammed had played an important role in ensuring the success of the swap. Secretary of State Antony Blinken thanked Saudi Arabia and Ukraine for their roles in freeing the two American citizens. ""The United States is appreciative of Ukraine including all prisoners of war, regardless of nationality, in its negotiations, and we look forward to these U.S. citizens being reunited with their families,"" he said in a statement. The senior State Department official said the two men were in the care of the U.S. Embassy in Saudi Arabia and would be on their way home ""before too long."" ABC News' Shannon K.

2022-09-19,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/International/war-ukraine-reached-turning-point/story?id=90019956,Has the war in Ukraine reached a turning point?,"By the six-month mark of Russia's war in Ukraine, the conflict had become a largely static one, with neither side conducting significant offensive operations. Until last week. Following a surprising counteroffensive, Ukraine said this week that it managed to recapture over 2,300 square miles of territory from Russia in the Kharkiv region in the northeast, including the strategic city of Izyum. The move also forced Russian troops to hastily retreat in what Russia's defense ministry called a ""regrouping"" of forces. Some military analysts see the counteroffensive as a turning point in the war, marking a likely end to Russia's ability to mount any major offensives in Ukraine again, while others -- including President Joe Biden -- have said it's hard to tell if that is indeed the case. Retired Col. Steve Ganyard, an ABC News contributor, called the offensive an important victory for Ukraine, though he noted that the battle in the south, near Kherson, is still crucial. ""The frontline is thousands of miles long. The Russians still maintain most of the Donbas and they're still holding up Ukrainian advances in the south,"" Ganyard said. ""It's a terrific victory for the Ukrainians. It will bolster their morale. It will show that they can fight better than the Russians can and it shows how weak the Russian military really is. But it is just one battle. One tactical, one operational victory. The war is still far from over."" Ukraine's offensive in the north seems to have caught Russian forces off-guard. After publicizing plans for a counteroffensive in Kherson last month, Ukrainian forces also pushed forward in the northeast unexpectedly last week. ""They actually sucker-punched the Russians,"" Ganyard said. ""The Russians moved 25 battle groups from the eastern front and the northeastern front, down to the area around Kherson to defend, add troops. So this made the lines up north around Kharkiv very thin."" The Russians may not have thought Ukraine could conduct two major offenses, but Ukrainian troops attacked the weakened front and ""flew through the remaining Russian defenses,"" Ganyard said. ""It's very extraordinary,"" said. ""We went from a relatively static battlefield for weeks if not months, to this amazing breakthrough, stunning breakthrough that the Ukrainians were able to conduct and achieve up in the north around Kharkiv."" More than 6,000 square kilometers were recaptured, according to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Ukrainian officials said they have retaken control of several cities, including Izyum -- which had been used as the main logistical hub for Russia's assault on the Donbas region. While the offensive is seen as strategically important for Ukraine and a major morale booster -- with the opposite implications for Russia -- there's still a long way to go in war, Ganyard said. Zelenskyy has previously stated his goal is to take back all Ukrainian territory from Russia, which still occupies around a fifth of Ukraine's territory, according to the Institute for the Study of War, a Washington D.C.-based think tank that has been closely tracking the war. Retaking Kherson, a city on the Dnieper River, would allow Ukraine to sustain its economy, Ganyard said. While a Russian counteroffensive seems unlikely given how ""decimated"" its military has become, Ukraine could run the risk of becoming stretched too thin, he said. ""The Ukrainians need to be careful that they don't overrun their supply chain, that they don't have such catastrophic success that they themselves become too thin and stretched out in the areas that they've retaken,"" Ganyard said. One key factor in the ongoing conflict will be the winter and the challenges that may bring. ""Clearly, the Ukrainians have the momentum and they will probably continue to hold that momentum going into the winter,"" he said. ""The winter season changes everything...Who knows what's going to happen when things begin to get cold.""",14,,,,12

Neat rows of wooden crosses. There is little dignity for the dead in this makeshift burial site in the forest. Names are noticeably absent from almost all of the wooden crosses. Instead, they are marked with three-digit numbers. The true extent of the atrocities allegedly carried out by Russian soldiers and officials in Izium, a city in the northeasterly Kharkiv region, is still emerging. Izium was occupied by the Russians for nearly six months. In total there are 440 wooden crosses, but no one knows yet how many bodies lie in the ground in these unmarked graves. On Sunday Ukrainian forensic teams exhumed 50 more bodies. An official involved in the investigations told ABC News that 16 of those 50 victims were killed violently. One of the victims had been stabbed multiple times and four victims were found in the same grave, according to officials. By a large pit is a cross with words written in Russian: ""Ukrainian Armed Forces, 17 men from the morgue."" Ukrainian investigators told ABC News that one of the bodies of the men found in that mass grave had signs of torture. A forensic team dug up the badly decomposed body. Officials invited journalists to witness the exhumation process on Friday. It was immediately clear that the man’s hands were bound with rope behind his back. Bending down, in his white plastic overalls and boots, the lead investigator called out his initial findings. There was flesh missing from the dead man’s right arm and signs that his clothes had been burnt and he had a cut around his genitals. A very small number of the graves do have names and the dates of birth and death. There were graves of two young girls, ages 6 and 9. Local officials said some of the victims buried at the site had been shot and many of them showed signs of injury from shrapnel. They said the Russians ruled through fear. Images of makeshift prisons and alleged torture chambers are emerging. In the spring, Ukrainians uncovered mass atrocities in Bucha, near Kyiv. Russian forces had occupied Bucha only briefly but left behind horrifying scenes of chaos and death, leading to international condemnation of alleged Russian war crimes. Concerns are now mounting that if Ukrainians reclaim more territory from Russian forces, something similar may be expected again. For now, authorities will continue the grim task of trying to identify the dead. Despite evidence including satellite imagery, CCTV video and testimony by victims, some of it obtained and verified by ABC News, Russia has repeatedly denied accusations of war crimes, even on occasion calling genuine photos and videos of dead victims ""fakes.""",13,,,,23
2022-09-16,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/International/top-putin-ally-appears-recruit-russian-prisoners-fight/story?id=89983114,Top Putin ally appears to recruit Russian prisoners to fight in Ukraine,"A video has emerged appearing to show a top ally of Vladimir Putin personally recruiting alleged Russian prisoners to fight in Ukraine and offering them pardons to do so. Yevgeny Prigozhin, who runs Wagner, a private military company heavily engaged in Ukraine, is purportedly seen speaking to a group of men at a Russian prison about joining its forces in Ukraine. A company owned by Prigozhin issued a sarcastic message appearing to confirm it is him in the footage. In the video circulating online, a man who appears to closely resemble Prigozhin is seen addressing a crowd of dozens of inmates in the yard of a prison camp. The man in the video promises the prisoners will receive a pardon of their sentences in return for joining Wagner and fighting in Ukraine for six months. ""Who do we need? We only need assault infantry, 60% of my guys are that,"" the man seen in the video tells the inmates. ""After half a year, you go home, having got a pardon."" Prigozhin, often nicknamed ""Putin's Chef"" because of a catering company he operates, appears to warn the group that if they sign up and refuse to fight, they would be seen as a deserter and be killed. ""The first sin is desertion. No one falls back, no one surrenders as a prisoner,"" the man seen in the video says. ""Those who arrive and on the first day say, 'I shouldn't be here,' we mark as a deserter and next, it's the firing squad."" In addition to being heavily involved in the fighting in Ukraine, Wagner also ran the Internet Research Agency that conducted a disinformation campaign aimed at interfering in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. The U.S. Department of Justice charged Prigozhin over the agency's campaign to meddle in the election with propaganda and disinformation. In March, the U.S. also sanctioned Prigozhin in response to Putin's invasion of Ukraine. In the video, the man tells the group he is mainly looking for men between the ages of 22 and 50, but that the key criteria is physical strength. They look closely at those with drug and sexual violence convictions, warning that there is no tolerance for looting or sex with local people, ""women, local flora, fauna, men,"" the man in the video says. The man seen in the video also tells the prisoners he will personally interview those wanting to sign up for five minutes before they undergo 2-3 hours of more questioning to see if they are suitable. The press service for Prigozhin's catering company, Concord, appeared to confirm it was him in the video. In a written response posted on its VKontakte, or VK -- Russian social media service -- page, it wrote: ""We really can confirm that the person in the video is miraculously similar to Evgeny Viktorovich [Prigozhin]. Judging by his rhetoric, he is in someway dealing with questions of the realisation of the Special Operation and, it looks like, it's going successfully for him,"" it wrote, referring to the term the Kremlin uses for the invasion. There have been widespread reports of Russia recruiting prisoners to fill a worsening manpower shortage for its forces following severe losses since the country invaded Ukraine in February. Just this week, Ukrainian forces made a major breakthrough in the Kharkiv region, capturing strategically important cities, according to Ukrainian officials and military sources. Ukrainian troops advanced 70 kilometers (43 miles) in less than a week, resulting in part of Russia's front-line collapse in Ukraine's northeast, with large numbers of Russian troops forced to retreat. Russia is running short on troops because Putin has refused to call a general mobilization or put the country on a war footing, worried about possible domestic unrest. Wagner has previously been used in global conflicts, including in Ukraine, when the Kremlin has sought a veneer of deniability. Wagner troops have been documented fighting in Syria, as well as several African countries, including Libya and the Central African Republic, and have been accused on numerous occasions of committing war crimes. In the current Ukraine war, they have become crucial shock troops, according to Western and Ukrainian officials, as well as Russian military journalists on the ground, that have been used to try to take ground in Donbas. The man seen in the video -- purportedly Prigozhin -- tells the prisoners it's a ""hard war"" in Ukraine, worse than in Chechnya or Afghanistan, claiming that he is using more than twice the amount of ammunition fired in the battle of Stalingrad in World War II. He claims to have large amounts of military hardware, including ""aircraft"" and artillery.",14,,,,13

While they acknowledge that the constant flow of U.S. military aid and equipment has helped ""change the battlefield dynamics,"" the officials also have been quick to praise Ukraine's military for how it has employed the equipment on the battlefield and for anticipating what weapons it would need to eventually launch the offensive. While there are few details of the long-anticipated Ukrainian offensive in the south targeting the city of Kherson, the surprise Ukrainian offensive launched near the city of Kharkiv has led to a dramatic turn of events In a matter of days, Western officials believe, Ukrainian military forces have retaken as much as 6,000 square kilometers of territory in northeastern Ukraine once held by Russia for months, pushing eastward from Kharkiv as far as 40 miles. The Ukrainian advance northward from Kharkiv has come as close as 10 miles to the border with Russia as Russian troops hastily retreated in what Russia's defense ministry called a ""regrouping"" of forces. ""On the ground in the vicinity of Kharkiv, we assess that Russian forces have largely ceded their gains to the Ukrainians and then withdrawn to the north and east,"" a senior U.S. military official told reporters Monday. ""Many of these forces have moved over the border into Russia."" ""We also assess that Ukrainian forces have very likely taken control of Kupiansk and Izyum in addition to smaller villages,"" said the official. Both cities were important to Russian military operations in eastern Ukraine, particularly Izyum, which had been used as the main logistical hub for its months-long assault on the Donbass region. ""We've seen the Ukrainians use to great effect, the capabilities that they have across the battlefield to change the battlefield dynamics,"" the official added, referring to military capabilities provided to Ukraine by the United States and other countries. Since Russia invaded Ukraine in late February, the United States has provided $14.5 billion in military equipment, including Javelin anti-tank weapons, Stinger portable anti-aircraft missiles, howitzer artillery, and the long-range HIMARS rockets (High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems) that can reach more than 40 miles behind enemy lines. While that assistance was described by the U.S. military official as being ""incredibly helpful,"" the official directed praise at Ukraine's military. ""Much of the credit, if not most of it goes to the Ukrainians and what they're doing to employ these capabilities,"" said the official. A senior U.S. defense official complimented Ukraine's communications with the United States to anticipate what gear it would need against Russia, such as requesting howitzer artillery to counter what they expected to be an ""artillery battle the Russians intended to wage"" to take over the Donbass region. That was soon followed by Ukraine's request for a counter to Russia's advantage in long range rocket systems and its establishment of major logistical hubs and military headquarters far behind enemy lines. ""That's when we started focusing on the ability of providing the HIMARS and GMLR systems (the rockets fired by HIMARS),"" said the official. ""So, it is absolutely a partnership and in listening to the understanding of what they're seeing, and then seeing what we can do to provide them with capabilities to address that."" Last week, Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Gen. Mark Milley said that the United States had provided ""thousands"" of the long-range rockets fired by the HIMARS systems that Ukraine has used to strike at more than 400 Russian targets behind enemy lines, including ammunition depots, logistical hubs, and military headquarters. ""They've had devastating effect,"" Milley said in Germany last week. ""Russian lines of communication and supply channels are severely strained. It is having a direct impact on the Russian ability to project and sustain combat power."" ""Russian command and control in the headquarters have been disrupted and they're having great difficulty resupplying their forces and replacing their combat losses,"" he added.",14,,,,12
2022-09-12,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/International/ukraines-advance-northeast-turning-point-war-military-analysts/story?id=89750922,Ukraine's advance in northeast likely turning point in war: Military analysts say,"Ukraine's stunning counteroffensive in its northeast likely marks a turning point in the war and has profound consequences for Russia's position going forward, according to military analysts. The counteroffensive has seen Russia's frontline in the Kharkiv region collapse in less than a week, forcing thousands of its troops to retreat as Ukrainian troops have recaptured hundreds of square miles of territory, officials said. The defeat not only removes Russia's ability to threaten Ukraine's second largest city, Kharkiv, but also likely ends Russia's ability to mount any major offensives in Ukraine again, the analysts said. It also will have a major knock-on effect on Russia's capacity to hold its positions on the other fronts around the country. It means in the long-run, the war now favors Ukraine, they said. ""Ukraine has turned the tide of this war in its favor,"" the Institute for the Study of War, a Washington D.C.-based think tank that tracks the war closely, wrote in an analysis. ""Kyiv will likely increasingly dictate the location and nature of the major fighting, and Russia will find itself increasingly responding inadequately to growing Ukrainian physical and psychological pressure in successive military campaigns unless Moscow finds some way to regain the initiative."" That does not mean the war will end soon, the ISW wrote—Russia still occupies around a fifth of Ukraine's territory— and is likely to continue into 2023, experts said. The Ukrainian counteroffensive routed a Russian force that had been one pincer in an attempt to seize the whole of the Donbas region, Russian President Vladimir Putin's minimum declared objective for the war. Ukraine retook the strategic city of Izyum, which had been the headquarters for the Russian effort to advance in Donbas from the north. Izyum's seizure means an end to the Russia's hopes of taking Donbas, the ISW and other analysts said. A second Russian offensive group trying to advance from the south onto the city of Bakhmut has now ""lost any real operational significance,"" the ISW wrote. Russian forces were already overstretched as they tried to seize the Donbas region, which made them unable to significantly advance for months, and painfully defending against a Ukrainian counteroffensive in the south, the experts said. Russia has been unable to replenish its forces because Putin has balked at ordering a full mobilization or putting the country on a war footing, fearing that could lead to domestic unrest that could threaten his rule, officials said. As a result, Russian forces are increasingly numerically inferior to Ukrainian in some areas. The Russian-appointed head of the Kharkiv region claimed Monday that Russian troops had been outnumbered 8-to-1 during the Ukrainian offensive. The rout of Russia's troops in the northeast—that saw them abandon dozens of tanks and vehicles—means it now must redeploy reserves that it does not have to stabilize the front there, experts said. But moving some of Russia's troops already deployed on other areas of the front risks giving Ukraine a chance to repeat its Kharkiv offensive elsewhere, hitting places where Russia has thinned its lines, according to the ISW. One potentially vulnerable area is the city of Kherson and the area around it west of the Dniepr river where Ukraine has already made it extremely difficult for Russia to re-supply its forces. Russia is reeling from the rout in the northeast, its troops' moral will be badly shaken. The risk for Moscow now is that the failure in the northeast could snowball elsewhere, triggering a domino effect as its forces panic and loses the will to fight, Konrad Muzyka, director of Rochan Consulting, told ABC News. Without a mass mobilization, that is fraught with huge political risks at home, Russia has no hope of reversing the direction of the war, Muzyka said. ""It's a horrible position to be in and actually there are no good choices,"" he said. ""They have to decide. The alternative is losing the war."" ""As a consequence of the north eastern rout of their forces, the Russians now have very few (if any) good choices. Their positions in the east are compromised and require a substantial realignment of defensive lines and logistics,"" Mick Ryan, a retired Australian major general and fellow at Center for Strategic and International Studies, wrote on Twitter: The grim outlook for Russia is shared by Russian nationalist military bloggers, who have large followings on social media and are often embedded with their forces there. The bloggers are the most vehement supporters of the war, but recently have written highly critical posts about the Russian leadership, furious at how the invasion has been conducted. They have demanded the Kremlin call a full mobilization and put Russia on a war footing, warning it is the only way to reverse the direction of the war. ""Not to recognise that Russia is waging a war is the greatest stupidity,"" Yury Kotyenok, who posts under the account Voenkor Kotenok Z, wrote following the retreat in the northeast. Recriminations over the disaster in northeast Ukraine also erupted unusually on a pro-Kremlin talk show on the channel NTV. Boris Nadezhdin, a politician, told his fellow guests Russia now faced a choice: ""Either mobilization and full-scale war, or we get out.""",14,,,,12

Ukrainian troops have advanced 70 kilometers in less than a week, resulting in part of Russia's front-line collapse in Ukraine's northeast, with large numbers of Russian troops forced to retreat. One Ukrainian military source described the multi-pronged offensive as ""a thoroughly planned operation"" and told ABC News that ""everything was running to schedule."" The source also claimed that Russian troops in the area ""were running away."" In a major development on Saturday, Ukrainian forces appeared to have retaken the strategically important city of Izyum. This claim was made by multiple unconfirmed reports on social media and confirmed by a military source to ABC News. Russian military bloggers, some of who are embedded with Russian troops in Ukraine, also said Russian forces had retreated from Izyum to avoid being encircled. Izyum was Russia's headquarters for its offensive into the neighboring Donetsk region. Russia's Defense Ministry on Saturday confirmed it has carried out what it called a ""regrouping"" of its forces around Izyum. Russian military bloggers wrote on social media in reality Russian forces had retreated, while Russian state media has described the situation as ""extremely difficult."" The dramatic advance by Ukrainian forces also reaffirms how much the war has shifted in Ukraine's favor and adds credence to claims by U.S. and British officials that Russian forces are overstretched. The retaking of the city also shows the impact that weaponry from the U.S. and its allies is having on the battlefield. ""U.S. assistance is arriving where it is needed,"" former U.S. ambassador to NATO, Kurt Volker told ABC News. ""The Ukrainians know how to use it."" ""The Russians are militarily exhausted,"" Volker claimed, and called on U.S. President Joe Biden's administration to provide even longer-range rockets to Ukraine. Ukraine’s counteroffensive in the northeast began late last week and swiftly broke through Russia’s line there. Since then Ukrainian forces had recaptured the city of Balakliya and on Saturday seized Kupiansk, a key logistics hub, according to Ukrainian officials as well as Russian pro-government journalists. The rapid offensive in the northeast has seen Ukrainian forces recapture the cities of Balakliya and Kupiansk, according to Ukrainian officials. Photos and videos of troops raising the Ukrainian flag are circulating online. Kupiansk is well-connected by rail and road -- making it a vital link in Russian supply lines in the area. By seizing the two cities, Ukrainian forces threatened to encircle completely thousands of Russian troops in Izyum, making its defense untenable and forcing Russia to withdraw them. On Friday night, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said his forces had liberated and gained control of 30 settlements in the northeast. The gains amounted to 2,500 square kilometers, according to the Institute for the Study of War. Ukrainian forces also claim to have retaken several villages in the southern region of the country in recent days. Unlike the offensive in the northeast, the southern offensive was widely publicized by Ukrainian officials, raising the possibility that the Russian military was distracted by events in the south, and caught off-guard when the Ukrainian military went on the offensive in the northeast.",14,,,,12

""It's a very difficult war,"" Zelenskyy told Muir from the presidential office in Kyiv. ""We will regain our territory."" You can watch more of David Muir's full interview with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on ABC's ""Good Morning America"" and ""World News Tonight."" Last week, the Ukrainian military launched a long-awaited counteroffensive near the southern port city of Kherson, which Russian forces seized in early March. Kherson was the first major Ukrainian city to fall to the Russians amid the early days of the full-scale invasion, which began on Feb. 24. The counteroffensive there is one of the first for Ukrainian troops that have been largely on the defensive. In his nightly video address on Sunday, the Ukrainian president said he had received ""good reports"" from his military commanders and head of intelligence. He thanks his troops for liberating a settlement in the eastern Donetsk region as well as two settlements in the south, and for advancing and regaining ""certain heights"" in an eastern area in the Lysychansk-Siversk direction. Zelenskyy told Muir that Ukrainians ""need to, step-by-step, de-occupy our territory."" ""This task is difficult and it doesn't only depend on us, but I'm sure that is what will happen,"" he added. ""It's only matter of time."" When asked why the Ukrainian military decided to launch the counteroffensive in the Kherson region at this time, Zelenskyy told Muir: ""I won't say that it's only counteroffensive in Kherson ... There is a direction or directions -- plural -- and we have to move forward."" Asked to clarify that the Kherson counteroffensive is not the only one underway in Ukraine, Zelenskyy said he ""can't discuss details of any military actions."" ""I want that the enemy gets some surprises from us,"" he added.

""It's a question of dialogue with terrorists. We cannot -- you cannot discuss anything with terrorists.

You can watch more of David Muir's full interview with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on ABC's ""Good Morning America"" and ""World News Tonight."" Zelenskyy cited suspected instances of rape and torture by Russian troops in areas outside of Kyiv during a retreat earlier this year. Images of tortured and bound bodies littered across neighborhoods like Bucha spread across the world. ""After rapes, after tortures, after murders, after we discovered a lot of dead bodies ... it's not a war, it's pure and clear terrorism, which Russia is doing against our nation and occupation of our land,"" the Ukrainian president said. ""So, we cannot have any compromises with terrorists. We cannot have any dialogue with the terrorists."" When pressed by Muir over the alleged atrocities, Zelenskyy said Putin was a war criminal and should be prosecuted. ""As any civilized person, any civilized man, I think that those responsible should not just go to hell, no, they should have fair trials -- fair, independent trials,"" Zelenskyy said. The comments come as Ukraine wages a counteroffensive to regain territory in the southern and eastern parts of the country that were lost to Russia. The main counteroffensive is focused around the port city of Kherson, which was the first major city Russia conquered in its invasion. However, Zelenskyy hinted to Muir that more than one counteroffensive is taking place. ""I won't say that it's only counteroffensive in Kherson. ...

2022-08-25,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/International/ukraines-volunteer-army-responds-russian-hackers-minister/story?id=88651955,"Ukraine's volunteer 'IT army' responds to Russian hackers, minister says","LVIV, Ukraine -- The largest power producer in Ukraine, which operates four nuclear power plants, last week survived what officials described as the most powerful attack on Ukraine by Russia hackers since the end of February. According to the Ukrainian nuclear agency, Energoatom, the attack did not cause any harm. At the same time, Ukrainians are hitting back at Russian digital infrastructure. In Russia, more than 600 online resources including the federal postal service, pension fund, online banking and video conference platforms were affected by Ukrainian hackers in this month, according to a statement by the Ministry of Digital Transformation of Ukraine. ""Cyberspace is a frontline of the 21st century, and victories there are as important as in actual battlefields,"" Mykhailo Fedorov, the Minister of Digital Transformation of Ukraine, told ABC News. He's responsible for establishing the so-called ""IT army"" -- a gathering of more than 230,000 anonymous volunteers who are working together via Telegram, an online messaging platform. Russia's assault on Ukraine has extended into the virtual domain as well as on real-life battlegrounds. And here the enemy is choosing very sensitive targets that could impact security for Ukraine, Europe and even the world. But Fedorov said his country's cyber security system was more than efficient. ""None out of over 800 cyberattacks since February 24 caused real losses for the Ukrainian economy, stopped the banking system or damaged critical infrastructure,"" he said. Some IT companies in Lviv, one of the biggest hubs for the industry, said they weren't eager to disclose their involvement in the country's digital defense efforts. Some in the Lviv IT community told ABC News it is a matter of a personal choice for members of their staff to join the fight. Stepan, a 41-year-old member of the IT army, spoke to ABC News but asked not to use his real name because of fears of reprisal. ""On the second or third day of a new phase of Russian aggression I saw the tweet from the minister of digital transformation about the establishment of a Telegram channel, and that was very helpful to figure it out, what exactly to do to help my country,"" Stepan said. He said he had no military experience and he spent all his time in front of his computer screen. Now, almost every day, Stepan and the rest of the unofficial Ukrainian IT army are being given clear online instructions explaining top targets and offering software they should use for the coordinated strike. As a programmer he understands that his input makes sense only as a part of a team effort: ""I am not doing a huge amount of work, but in general, when we are acting all together, our input is very useful."" ""I just start some applications and I am free for coffee, tracking the process from time to time -- maybe some new targets emerged,"" he said, adding that the IT warriors were not staying in front of their computers every moment of the day. He added, ""I am always analyzing and searching for some additional information. Why this particular target is important, who are those people to be affected by our interference."" When asked if he worried about the impact of his efforts on everyday Russians, he said that ""it is not the time for that, as I do not see any changes in Russian society during these months -- sure, it is not a matter of some rapid shifts in their consciousness. That is why we just have to keep on doing what we are doing."" The volunteer-based IT army's mission now is to hold the digital frontline of Ukraine while the regular cyber forces are still in the process of assembling, Fedorov, the minister, said. The country is countering Russian cyber-attacks on a daily basis, he said. Russia is weaker after at least 40 cybersecurity companies announced their withdrawal from the Russian market and suspended service for Russian clients, Fedorov said. ""As many software or hardware solutions just cannot be replaced by Russian-owned technologies, it takes time to develop their own solutions,"" he said. The minister also said he was is counting on international support for Ukraine, asking the international tech sector to share the newest cyber solutions and offer service and equipment, which can help Ukraine. ""We are showing Russia that tech is a future, and tech will win over large manpower and outdated tanks,"" he said. As a member of the IT army, Stepan said he believed that he is weakening the Russian economy and its sponsorship of the terror on Ukrainian soil. And he is not the only member of his family who is involved into the struggle. ""Together with my wife, who is also a volunteer, but in a different way, we are actively waiting for this war to end,"" he said.",3,,,,6
2022-08-24,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/months-fighting-war-ukraine/story?id=88700360,"After 6 months of fighting, what's next in the war in Ukraine?","When Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24, the conventional wisdom among many U.S. national security officials and analysts was that Ukraine's military would be able to resist only for a few days, possibly a week. But six months later, Russia's invasion of Ukraine has stalled as Russia's military capabilities have fallen far short of what they seemed on paper, and Ukraine's military, buttressed by a constant supply of weapons from the U.S. and the rest of the international community, has demonstrated it will fight hard in every part of the country. ABC News asked national security analysts and a senior British military officer to discuss how the battle in Ukraine has evolved over the last six months and what could come next. In February, when Russian troops invaded Ukraine simultaneously along multiple fronts, it appeared to be an effort to overwhelm Ukraine's military in quick order. But six weeks later the combined effects of Russia's poor military decisions and planning led to the tactical withdrawal of its forces stalled north of the capital Kyiv and a shift towards the Donbass region in the east. Since then, months of intensive artillery barrages and rising casualties have resulted in only small territorial gains for Russian troops and as Ukraine has prepared for a counteroffensive in southern Ukraine, the fight has already begun to shift to that region. And it has been a costly one for both Russia and Ukraine. The U.S. believes Russia has suffered between 70,000 and 80,000 killed and wounded among its military forces and in June Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky acknowledged between 60 to 100 military fatalities a day among his forces. ""I am guessing that some kind of a stalemate will develop in the course of the next few weeks or certainly by the cold weather,"" Michael O'Hanlon with the Brookings Institution, told ABC News. ""And then the question will be do the two sides decide it's time for diplomacy and maybe have some creative notions of shared sovereignty or putting off certain territorial issues for a longer term referendum?"" O'Hanlon speculates there could be a lull in the fighting in Ukraine this winter as both sides rebuild their forces for a fight next year, much as was seen during World War I. Retired U.S. Army Lt. Gen. Ben Hodges, an adviser with Human Rights First, told ABC News that Russia has moved into a war of attrition that it may not win. As the top Army officer in Europe, Hodges developed the U.S. military training program for Ukraine's security forces following Russia's 2014 invasion of Crimea. ""If you're going to do attrition, you have to have three things: You have to have a lot of people, you have to have a lot of resources, and you have to have a lot of time. And the Russians don't have any of those three,"" said Hodges. ""So, they've chosen, unfortunately for them, the wrong strategy to defeat Ukraine."" Hodges believes Russia's logistical supply network has been stretched to its limits and will be unable to continue to resource Russian troops over the long term and he is not convinced that the Russian people will continue to support the invasion as time goes by. ""There are a lot of things working against Russia in terms of time, and so this is why I believe that Ukraine is going to win, that they're going to they're going to be able to push Russia back at least to the 23 February line by the end of this year,"" Hodges predicted. Air Vice Marshal Mick Smeath, the defense attaché at the United Kingdom's embassy in Washington, is more circumspect about what lies ahead. ""I think Putin is probably shocked"" at the Russian military's performance on the battlefields of Ukraine, said Smeath, who releases a daily intelligence update consisting of unclassified details from the U.K.'s Ministry of Defence Defence Intelligence. ""I'm not in his mind, but I'm sure he is looking at even now his narrow objectives, because his military campaign is failing,"" said Smeath. ""And he is getting to a point where his troops are stagnating and he is making very, very insignificant gains whereas the Ukrainians are defending strong."" Smeath is confident that one thing that will continue for the foreseeable future is the flow of western military aid to Ukraine. ""All I can say is that as in the UK, I can certainly say the same for our American friends and all of our our partner nations, we will keep supporting Ukraine to ensure that Russia does not get any any further gains and Ukrainian protects her people,"" said Smeath. Russia's military was expected to quickly overwhelm Ukraine in short order given their vast inventory of weapons, a recent modernization effort, and a switch towards a more professional force instead of just relying on conscripts. But the last six months of war in Ukraine have exposed Russia's military capabilities and left them in a far weakened state as its battalion tactical groups consistently suffered heavy casualties ""I think I'm certainly in the crowd of people that overestimated Russian capabilities and also somewhat surprised at how poorly they have performed,"" said Hodges who attributes some of Russia's poor performance to corruption within Russia's military ""in the form of false reporting about numbers, shoddy equipment, zero quality control over things over how ammunition is stored, all the stuff, which are ways where you can make money if you're in in the system."" Russia's recent military modernization effort focused on the integration of its warfighting capability in land, sea, and cyberspace. ""In reality, that is not the case, they have not been able to do that,"" according to Smeath. ""They've been pretty incompetent and quite ineffective."" ""The Russians made some big mistakes"" that O'Hanlon said outweighed their numerical advantage in the number of troops and technology. To that point, O'Hanlon highlighted Russian plans to drive heavy military vehicles over fields that were not as frozen as expected that led to bottlenecks on roads that exposed them to attacks by Ukrainian fighters. While Russia's poor performance on the battlefield may have been unexpected, O'Hanlon pointed out that there were indicators given that were indications it could happen given that ""we haven't seen the Russians fight well on a large scale in a very long time."" And that includes fighting against a determined military force and population. ""I never doubted that Ukrainians would fight very well,"" said Hodges. ""We have been working with them since 2015. So I was sure that the soldiers would do well."" But Hodges acknowledges not anticipating ""the resilience of the Ukrainian population. ""I didn't anticipate how strong they would be in how they would deal with this,"" he said. ""I think Russia completely underestimated the fact that they are a sovereign nation and they were not going to be invaded by a nation that they do not want to be part of,"" said AVM Smeath. ""I think Russia completely got that wrong."" ""Russia has been I think pretty desperate and pretty ineffective with their campaign,"" said Smeath. ""They haven't achieved anywhere near what they wanted to achieve. "" And that is also due in large measure to the constant flow of weapons and ammunition to Ukraine being provided by the United States and other countries. Early in the war American Javelin and British NLAW anti-tank missiles had an immediate impact against Russian tanks as did subsequent aid packages of Stinger portable anti-aircraft missiles. O'Hanlon acknowledges that the emergence of American-made HIMARS rockets systems used by Ukraine to strike at Russian headquarters and ammunition dumps as much as 50 miles away has had a significant impact on the fight in the Donbass but he is not sold on the idea that they are a complete game changer. ""I think we should watch very carefully what's going to happen in these next few weeks because my guess is that we'll already start to see some limitations of what the new technologies are able to achieve for Ukraine and yes, some kind of stalemate, perhaps on better terms than exists today,"" said O'Hanlon. And Hodges believes that even more sophisticated weapons will be needed if the goal is for Ukraine to defeat Russia. ""I think if if we were serious about Ukraine winning, not just avoiding defeat, but winning then we would be pushing a significant amount of weapons, long range fires, they can accomplish what we're seeing now in bits and pieces,"" said Hodges. ""That's what would become decisive. That's what would help set the conditions for Ukraine to launch a successful counter attack",14,,,,4
2022-08-24,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/International/ukrainian-celebrates-independence-day-marks-months-war/story?id=88728029,Ukraine celebrates Independence Day as it marks 6 months of war,"KYIV and LONDON -- As Ukraine prepared on Wednesday to celebrate its Independence Day, residents of Kyiv, the capital, took to the streets to take photographs with rows of destroyed Russian tanks, which have become a symbol of Russia’s failed strategy to take the city. The Russian army may have failed in its early plans to replace the Ukrainian government, but a war of attrition has set into the country’s east, with analysts warning that the war may drag on for months or even years. Despite the presence of the tanks, the atmosphere in the capital this week has been mostly muted, residents said. But authorities have warned that Independence Day may bring renewed Russian strikes on the city, far away from the frontlines. The United States repeated those warnings, with Americans being advised to leave the country via private means. The U.S. Embassy in Kyiv said the State Department “has information that Russia is stepping up efforts to launch strikes against Ukraine's civilian infrastructure and government facilities in the coming days."" With the city on high alert and the country under assault, the overlap of the two anniversaries has proven to be a moment for Ukrainians to reflect on the meaning of their independence. Ukraine issued its Declaration of Independence from the Soviet Union on Aug. 24, 1991. The day has since been one of Ukraine’s state holidays, usually marked by a military parade. ""During these six months, we changed history, changed the world and changed ourselves,"" President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in a speech on Wednesday. ""And the whole world learned who Ukrainians are. What Ukraine is. No one will say about it anymore: it is somewhere over there, near Russia."" The Ukrainian public not only supports the struggle to liberate the Russian controlled-areas, but has said it believes that Ukraine will win the war, according to polling in the country, though reports suggest Ukrainians are more divided on how much territory taken back would constitute a victory. But it has also left a nation traumatized by war. Millions have been displaced and hundreds of civilians are killed each week, according to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. Humanitarians fear that the winter will bring more misery. There have been almost 1,000 verified deaths of children, according to the U.N., though observers say this number is likely higher. For many, independence now carries a new significance. “When Ukraine became an independent country, I was a little kid, I was only ten and at that time, I really couldn’t understand what is going on around, but I have heard many times from my grandmother about evil of Russian empire,” Andriy, 41, a musician, traumatologist and radio anchor from Lviv who now serves as a medic on the southern front, told ABC News. “When [the] Russian war exploded with more power on February 24, now I understand independence of Ukraine as [an] absolutely new thing.” German, a 59-year-old Kyiv resident, said there is a new clarity about what it means to be an independent country on the eve of the anniversary. “Until February 24, 2022, there was no clearly formed understanding of independence,” he told ABC News. “After the start of the war, the vision was as follows: independence is free people hardened into a nation that moves its state forward.” For some of the displaced, being forced to flee from the east has uprooted their sense of local identity and connection to home, even if they believe in Ukraine’s ultimate victory. “Maybe now I will sound in a stupid way, but I don't want to adapt, to adjust,” Yana, a 32-year-old who left the city of Kharkiv in March to the comparatively safe western city of Lviv, told ABC News. “No, not because I'm somehow abnormal, just because I don't have a sense of home anywhere… Lviv is a wonderful city, and Vinnytsia, and Poltava, and Kremenchuk, and all other cities, but my home is not there.” “What has changed now, every minute of our existence, we need to prove and fight for our independence,” she said. “Which until February 24 was a common thing and understandable to everyone.” For many Ukrainians, the war has changed not just their understanding of independence, but their entire lives, forever. “Adaptation is very simple,” German said. “It will never be the same again, as it was before. So I do what I can for the victory.”",17,,,,12
2022-08-23,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/International/months-invasion-endgame-ukraine/story?id=88210112,"6 months into invasion, what is the endgame in Ukraine?","Wednesday marks six months since Russia invaded Ukraine. In the months since Russia's blitzkrieg attack from the north and east, which was met with a stronger-than-expected resistance from the outmanned and outgunned Ukrainians, the evolving conflict has become more of a ""static war"" with no clear winners, according to ABC News contributor retired Col. Steve Ganyard. ""At this stage, both countries, both Ukraine and Russia, seem to be losing,"" Ganyard said. ""And now the fight is obviously who can lose first and who will have to lose last."" It's impossible to predict how much longer the war will last -- it could be months or even years, Ganyard said. ""This is a war that's unfolding at this point very, very slowly,"" he said. ""Neither side has the ability to conduct significant offensive operations."" How long the fighting continues until one side ""loses first"" will likely depend on a few factors. For Russia, getting troops on the ground to maintain the territory it's taken is one, as recruiting personnel has been a challenge, Ganyard said. The Russian military hasn't given an official update on casualties since late March, when it reported around 1,350. One U.S. Department of Defense official estimated earlier this month that at least 70,000 Russians have been killed or wounded since the start of the war. ""There's a lot of fog in war, but, you know, I think it's safe to suggest that the Russians have probably taken 70 or 80,000 casualties in less than six months,"" Colin Kahl, the undersecretary for defense for policy at the Department of Defense, told reporters. Russian President Vladimir Putin has a ""very difficult chore"" to recruit qualified military personnel to fight in Ukraine, Ganyard said. ""The Russians are basically recruiting out of prisons at this point,"" he said. ""They have not mobilized the whole nation."" The number of Ukrainian soldiers killed since Feb. 24 is classified, but deputy minister of defense Hanna Maliar has said there are ""thousands."" There have also been thousands of civilian casualties; the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights estimates that over 5,500 have been killed and over 7,600 injured in Ukraine since Feb. 24. For Ukraine, continued support from the West will be key, Ganyard said, including supplies of precision weapons such as the long-range High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems, or HIMARs, which Ukrainian forces have used to wear down Russians in rear areas. ""The ability for the Ukrainians to target very precise locations -- command posts, supply depots -- this allows the Ukrainians to begin to attrite and wear down the Russians in their rear areas, take away the supplies that they're using to conduct this war,"" Ganyard said. This development is ""unprecedented"" so far in the conflict, he said. ""Up to this point, the war had been basically a slugfest -- artillery against artillery,"" he said. ""But now that the Ukrainians have this long-range capability where they can hit very precise coordinates, it gives them an offensive advantage."" Though as the conflict continues, there is a risk for Ukraine that Western support could wane as the impacts of the war, such as from energy supplies in Europe, are felt in the months ahead, he said. How much more of a beating their contracted economies can withstand will be a factor for both countries, Ganyard said. ""As we see both economies get drawn down, as we see both militaries being punished and diminished, it's going to be a question of who can survive and who can lose last,"" he said. Morale also continues to be crucial, with Ukraine buoyed by its offensive advantage while Russia looks to hold ground in hostile territory, he said. For Kahl, ""Ukrainian morale and will to fight is unquestioned and much higher, I think, than the average morale and will to fight on the Russian side,"" he told reporters. ""I think that gives the Ukrainians a significant advantage."" With those factors in consideration, there are several ways the conflict could potentially play out: In a ""best-case scenario"" for Russia, its troops will continue to gain incrementally in the Donbas and hold their ground against Ukrainian forces, Ganyard said. If Ukraine doesn't have the arsenal to push back or can't hold out amid a downhill economy, that could put them in a position to sue for peace, he said. ""Where the Russians are pushing in from the east toward the west, that is the bread basket of Ukraine,"" Ganyard said. ""That is where not only most of the industry is, but it's where most of the agriculture, very rich agricultural area, all of that gets transported down the Dnipro River. ""If Russia would be able to hang on to that, it would almost cut Ukraine in half, and certainly cut the Ukrainian economy by more than half,"" he continued. If Ukraine manages to recapture some of the territory in the Donbas claimed by Russian forces since the invasion started, that could pressure Putin to end the invasion to stave off further embarrassment, Ganyard said. ""If he began to lose, if he began to take even heavier losses, if the Ukrainians were able to recapture parts of Ukraine that the Russians have taken, at some point Putin may decide to cut his losses and declare victory and take whatever's left on the table in terms of the territory that he's taken thus far,"" Ganyard said. Alternately, Putin may push back against the political embarrassment of losing territory it had gained since the start of the invasion, Ganyard said. ""The more gains that the Ukrainians make, it's actually going to make the whole situation more dangerous because Putin may react in a way that escalates to de-escalate,"" Ganyard said. ""We've heard that term in the past, and usually that refers to the use of tactical battlefield nuclear weapons. ""The danger here is if the Ukrainians continue to do better, what does Putin do to save himself to save his beloved, domestic political position?"" he continued. ""Does he do something that would shock the whole world and try to scare the Ukrainians into an early surrender?"" Kherson, a port city on the north of the Crimean Peninsula, was the first major city to fall after Russia launched its invasion. The city is key to Ukraine for its access to the Black Sea and ability to move goods. If Ukraine manages to make ground and pushes past Kherson and threatens Russia-annexed Crimea, that could give Ukraine a negotiating advantage, Ganyard said. ""[Ukrainian President Volodymyr] Zelenskyy will continue to try to threaten Crimea to be able to pressure Putin,"" he said. That could look like threatening to turn off the freshwater supplies into Crimea, he said. ""There's all sorts of unknowns here about what happens,"" Ganyard said. ""As they go into the fall and into the winter, there may be some movement in terms of the negotiations. But at this point, neither side can afford to give up the kinds of military actions that we see on the ground to this point.""",14,,,,12
2022-08-22,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/International/russia-ukraine-conflict-continues-impact-civilians/story?id=88210989,How the Russia-Ukraine conflict continues to impact civilians,"Six months into Russia's invasion, a humanitarian crisis continues to unfold in Ukraine, as millions have been displaced and thousands killed during the conflict. With no immediate end in sight to the fighting, humanitarian aid responders are fearful that winter will only bring further suffering for Ukrainian citizens already afflicted by six months of war. Hundreds of civilians are killed or wounded each week, primarily due to explosive weapons, such as shelling from air strikes and missiles, according to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, which has been verifying civilian casualties since the start of the invasion. “Civilians continue to pay too high a price in this war,"" the U.N.'s political and peacebuilding chief, Rosemary DiCarlo, said in remarks to the U.N. Security Council in June. By the U.N's most recent count, as of Aug. 21, there have been over 13,400 verified civilian casualties in Ukraine since Feb. 24, including nearly 1,000 children. So far over 5,500 civilians have been killed and over 7,800 injured, according to the U.N., though those numbers are likely considerably higher. ""There are some black holes,"" Matilda Bogner, head of the U.N. Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine, told ABC News. ""For example Mariupol, which went through very severe, very heavy hostilities and connections were cut off. For a period of time it was not possible to speak to people there. It was very difficult to get full information."" March has so far seen the highest number of civilian injuries and deaths -- on a ""much larger scale"" than the most intense fighting after Russian forces invaded eastern Ukraine in 2014, Bogner said. A U.N. report found that from 2014 to 2016, up to 2,000 civilians were killed in Ukraine due to the conflict with Russia. ""While we don't know the full extent, I think we have a fairly clear picture and it means that a lot of civilians are suffering,"" Bogner said of this latest conflict. The U.N. has raised concerns that the high number of civilian casualties indicates that Russia is not complying with international humanitarian law. In one of the deadliest assaults on civilians, hundreds of people who were taking refuge in a theater in the besieged port city of Mariupol were killed in an air strike in March. Amnesty International called the act a ""clear war crime"" by Russian forces. In Kramatorsk, in eastern Ukraine, dozens were killed in a rocket strike on a train station that was being used for civilian evacuations. Amnesty International said it has also documented evidence that Russian forces executed civilians in Ukraine in apparent war crimes, which Russia has denied. According to the World Health Organization, there have been 445 attacks related to health care in Ukraine reported between Feb. 24 and Aug. 11 -- including against health facilities, as well as personnel and patients. Such attacks violate international humanitarian law, which has a higher level of protection for medical establishments, Bogner said. They may have helped contribute to the high number of civilian deaths reported in March, she said, if injured civilians were unable to seek care. The attacks also prevent people from accessing regular health care, including for chronic conditions, and child vaccinations, Marysia Zapasnik, Ukraine country director for the humanitarian aid organization International Rescue Committee, told ABC News. ""That will have a lasting impact,"" Zapasnik said. ""Their health care system is really overstretched at the moment."" Schools have also been impacted during the war. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said more than 2,000 educational institutions in Ukraine, including kindergartens, schools and universities, have been destroyed in Russian air strikes. September means the beginning of the new school year, though many schools are not in a position to open because they do not have a bomb shelter or they've been damaged, Bogner said. ""One reason why see so many schools attacked is that we have documented armed forces from both sides using schools as bases,"" Bogner said. ""That then means it becomes a legitimate object for the other side to attack. So this is certainly something that we discourage."" For Ukrainians, the past six months have been filled with stress and anxiety. ""A lot of families' coping mechanisms are being stretched now to breaking points,"" Zapasnik said. ""There are air raid sirens here on a regular basis,"" said Zapasnik, who is based in Odesa. ""The level of psychosocial stress is quite high across the country, but specifically in the east and south."" Women and children, who are often the most vulnerable in conflict situations, may be in particular need of support, she said. ""Dealing with things such as family separation, death of a loved one, going through a lot of stress, fear, a sense of helplessness,"" she said. Families may also be stressed financially, especially if they've lost their livelihood during the war, she said. Millions of civilians are also without sufficient access to necessities, such as food, water and power sources. As of Aug. 3, UNICEF estimates that nearly 16 million people need humanitarian assistance due to the crisis. ""This continued war in Ukraine is causing extreme civilian harm,"" Zapasnik said. ""Apart from the civilian deaths and injuries ... the war is also leaving millions without sufficient access to food, water, power sources, health care and other essential items."" The International Rescue Committee expects the number of those in need of humanitarian assistance to ""increase dramatically"" in the winter months, as civilians continue to be displaced and there is no electricity when temperatures plunge, Zapasnik said. Humanitarian aid organizations are starting to plan for winter now due to challenging supply chain logistics, Zapasnik said, so that they're not caught flatfooted in their response. ""Currently what I'm most concerned about is the winter,"" Zapasnik said.",17,,,,17
2022-08-12,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/International/wanted-off-skin-ukrainian-women-recount-rape-russian/story?id=86994779,'I wanted to take off my skin': Ukrainian women recount rape by Russian soldiers,"The three Russian soldiers arrived at Victoria's house claiming they needed to seize her cell phone. But they weren't looking for phones. Victoria, a 42-year-old Ukrainian woman, told ABC News she and another woman, a neighbor, were raped by two of the Russian soldiers occupying her village near Kyiv in March. ABC News spoke to the two women who agreed to talk about what they say happened to them, on condition that their location and last names not be revealed. Another soldier, a commanding officer who was not involved in the assault, threatened Victoria, she says. ""He looked at me and said, 'You see, our boys have had a drink and want to have fun,'"" Victoria recounts. ""I understood that something terrible would happen."" Two of the soldiers took the women to a house converted into headquarters for the Russian occupiers and raped them, they say. That neighbor, 44-year-old Natalya, recounted the events to ABC News. ""He says, 'do you want everything to be fine with your son? So get upstairs and do as I tell you,'"" Natalya recalled, describing her encounter with one of the Russian soldiers she says raped her. ""He was like an animal…And that rifle was hanging around and swinging."" Natalya says she later learned the soldiers killed her husband after she was taken away. Its unclear how many soldiers or which ones were involved in the killing. The family buried her husband the next day. The two Russian soldiers the women say raped them have not yet been identified but face international arrest warrants, according to Kateryna Duchenko, the Ukrainian prosecutor in charge of sexual violence cases committed by Russian soldiers. Both cases are being investigated with slim chances of the suspects being taken under custody or doing any prison time, she said. Stories of rape and other atrocities at the hands of Russian troops are not unheard of in small towns and suburbs of Kyiv. Residents of Bucha and Borodyanka have reported human rights violations including rape, murder and torture by Russian forces during the invasion. Russian authorities have not responded to ABC News' requests for comment on the cases. ""The last case [we identified] was in occupied territory of Zaporizhzhia region, where allegedly 10 Russian soldiers raped a woman,"" Duchenko said. Communication with residents inside Russian-occupied territories is extremely difficult, making the investigation and prosecution of these cases nearly impossible, Duchenko said. ""We know she is alive and that she had medical treatment and those details are all we've got,"" Duchenko said on the limited information in the case in Zaporizhzhia. The United Nations reported in June it had collected 124 reports of alleged acts of conflict-related sexual violence but qualified that number as ""the tip of the iceberg"" and added that it did ""not reflect the scale of sexual violence in the context of Russia's war against Ukraine."" Victoria and Natalya say they are now undergoing counseling with a psychologist about their trauma. ""I wanted to take off my skin and throw it away,"" Victoria says. ""The person I was before the war is no longer there. I became more aggressive. I began to fight more for my own."" Natalya says she is still coming to terms with the assault. ""Many people have asked me, why aren't you crying, why haven't you gone crazy?"" she said. In June, Ukrainian authorities said they opened the first trial on sexual violence committed by a Russian soldier, according to the Kyiv Post. The suspect will be tried in absentia. Duchenko's office says it is working on prosecuting two other cases of sexual violence committed by Russian soldiers in addition to the case opened in June. The suspects will also be tried in absentia, since they are not in Ukrainian custody.",13,,,,23
2022-07-18,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/International/ukrainians-forcibly-deported-russian-filtration-camps/story?id=86898080,Ukrainians are being forcibly deported to Russian 'filtration camps',"Eduard Mkrtchian, injured during Russian shelling of the Ukrainian city of Mariupol, said he was forced to evacuate and, at a Russian-controlled checkpoint, said he was given false information and forced to travel into Russia. He told officials he wanted to go to western Ukraine, to a city called Zaporizhzhia, but was told “there's no Zaporizhzhia anymore,” he said in an interview with ABC News’ Ines de La Cuetara. Instead, he was brought to a so-called “filtration camp,” a checkpoint in Russian-controlled areas of Ukraine where reports have emerged of people being interrogated for hours, their biometric data being recorded and their photos on their phones wiped. He said he was repeatedly misled, and brought deeper and deeper into Russia. “I was deceivingly taken to Russia,” he told ABC News. The U.S. Department of State estimates that between 900,000 and 1.6 million Ukrainian citizens, including 260,000 children, have been “interrogated, detained, and forcibly deported” to Russia, adding that “the unlawful transfer and deportation of protected persons is a grave breach of the Fourth Geneva Convention on the protection of civilians and is a war crime.” There are at least 18 “filtration camps” that have been set-up along the Russia-Ukraine border, according to Michael Carpenter, the U.S. ambassador to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. During his interrogation, Mkrtchian says, “they asked me to undress. They asked me the meaning of every tattoo on my body. They deliberated a long time whether or not to let me go. I realized that they could kill me here,” he said. “You have to fill out a form. There are different questions. For example - do you have relatives in the armed forces of Ukraine, do you know about the location of Ukrainian military bases, and so on,” said Mariupol resident Ruslan Bojko, who says he spent four days at a “filtration camp.” ABC News spoke with Bojko on a reappropriated cruise ship in Tallinn, Estonia, that now houses more 1,800 Ukrainian refugees. “These people don’t have a choice, they have to comply,” Tanya Lokshina, Europe and Central Asia associate director for Human Rights Watch, told ABC News. “The de facto choice, the only option that they have, is to remain in the streets and die under shelling."" According to a statement released on Wednesday by the U.S. Department of State, “evidence is mounting that Russian authorities are also reportedly detaining or disappearing thousands of Ukrainian civilians who do not pass ‘filtration.’” ""There are very strong grounds to believe that those individuals detained by them experience ill treatment and even torture,"" said Lokshina. ""The woman who was sitting next to me in the filtration camp, her husband had been gone for two weeks. He was taken away for filtration and not returned. There were at least 10 women I spoke with who had similar stories,” said Mkrtchian. Russia has acknowledged that it is resettling Ukrainian refugees, yet claims it is for ""humanitarian"" reasons. After spending time in a refugee camp in Russia, Mkrtchian eventually traveled across Russia to Estonia where he now lives, awaiting the opportunity to return to Ukraine. “How can I stay in a country that destroyed my life?” he said.",13,,,,22
2022-07-16,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/International/maternity-clinic-ukraine-controlled-donbas-lifeline-war-closes/story?id=86880988,Last maternity clinic in Ukraine-controlled Donbas a lifeline as war closes in,"In the last specialist maternity ward still under Ukrainian control in the eastern Donbas region, the windows are packed with sandbags. Rooms used for births at the Perinatal Centre in the city of Pokrovsk follow the two-wall rule, which says the safest parts of a building are separated from the outside by at least two walls. ""Sometimes we've had to deliver babies during shelling,"" said Dr. Ivan Tsyganok, head of the centre. ""Labour is a process that cannot be stopped."" The centre, roughly 40 km (25 miles) from the closest front line, gives a glimpse of the suffering the war is inflicting on pregnant women - their anxiety over where they can give birth, fears of whether the hospital will come under attack, and what doctors have observed to be an increased rate of early labour. Tsyganok fears the stress of living under Russian attack has led to a spike in premature births, a fear borne out in initial data from the centre, shared with Reuters, and observed elsewhere in conflict zones. Russia denies targeting civilians but many Ukrainian cities, towns and villages have been left in ruins as Europe's biggest conflict since World War Two grinds towards the five month mark. Moscow says it is conducting a ""special military operation"" to disarm Ukraine and defend Russian-speakers from persecution by nationalists - an allegation dismissed by Kyiv as a baseless pretext for an imperial-style land grab. Katya Buravtsova's second child, Illiusha, was among those born early, delivered at only 28 weeks. He would have had ""zero chance"" at survival if not for the centre, Tsyganok said. But thanks to an incubator and the care he received at the clinic, he is now doing well. ""We looked after him 24 hours per day,"" Tsyganok said, wearing turquoise scrubs and Crocs. Comforting her tiny son, 35-year-old Buravtsova said she had been uncertain how she would give birth, as her village, close to the frontline city of Kurakhove, was shelled. ""You could be forced to give birth in a cellar,"" she said. In 2021, about 12% of just over 1,000 babies born at the centre were born before 37 weeks of pregnancy, according to data Tsyganok shared with Reuters. This rate – compared with a Ukraine-wide average of about 9%, according to the WHO - was typical for previous years in the centre, he said. Since the Feb. 24 invasion, 19 of the 115 babies born at the hospital were premature, a rate of about 16.5%, he said. The total number of births was low since many women had fled, he added. Tsyganok established the centre in 2015, the year after Russian proxies seized large swathes of the Donetsk and Luhansk. regions, which make up the Donbas. Nearby Donetsk, the largest city in the region and home to a large maternity hospital, had fallen under the control of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic in 2014. Doctors at the new centre anecdotally observed that the smouldering conflict, which would kill more than 14,000 people between 2014 and 2022, was having an impact on pregnancies. In 2017, an obstetrician-gynecologist at the centre, Olesia Kushnarenko, set out to prove it, conducting research for a doctoral thesis on how wartime stress in expecting mothers affected the placenta. Her study followed 69 otherwise healthy women, who lived close to the fighting and were assessed to have high stress levels, through their pregnancies. More than half of the women were found to have fetoplacental dysfunction – when oxygen and nutrients are not sufficiently transferred to the foetus - Kushnarenko said, a rate four-times higher than that found among a control group of 38 women. Kushnarenko also found higher rates of complications, including premature birth, among the babies born to mothers with high levels of stress. Now in Spain with her two children, she predicts the current conflict is having an even greater impact on pregnancies. ""This war is much hotter than before. It's very dangerous all over Ukraine,"" she said. MARIUPOL HOSPITAL Tsyganok says the sandbags in the windows will not save the clinic and its patients in the event of a direct hit, like the one at a hospital in Mariupol in March. There, at least three people died when a Russian missile hit the hospital, sending expectant mothers, some with shrapnel wounds, fleeing in hospital gowns, according to Ukrainian authorities and press photos. Russia's Defence Ministry denied having bombed the hospital, and accused Ukraine of staging the incident. With the Mariupol centre gone and another in nearby Kramatorsk closed, the Pokrovsk facility now serves the remaining population of the Ukraine-controlled Donetsk region, about 340,000 people, according to the regional governor. Among those attending the centre in Pokrovsk was Viktoriya Sokolovska, 16, expecting a baby girl. ""The shooting is affecting my nerves,"" she said late last month, while 36 weeks pregnant and trying her best to remain calm. She feared ""all the nervousness will pass over to the baby."" She has since given birth to a healthy daughter, Emilia.",17,,,,17
2022-07-12,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/International/western-lviv-concern-attacks-hangs-everyday-life/story?id=86584250,"In western Ukraine, concerns about Russian attacks hang over everyday life, mayor says","LVIV, Ukraine -- After a series of meetings with local military and civilian authorities this month, Andriy Sadovyi, the mayor of Lviv, the western Ukrainian city that’s remained largely untouched by the Russian invasion, warned of a possible escalation. “The danger of invasion from Belarus is actual -- there are no guarantees that there will be no chemical attack or local nuclear strike,” Sadovyi told ABC News a few days ago, following one of his short talks with a local representative of the State Emergency Service. Ukrainian military intelligence officials said there's no immediate danger, despite constant military activity and intensifying reconnaissance by Belarus near the border. There have been rumors of an impending attack, perhaps spread deliberately by pro-Russian forces to divert attention from other frontlines, Sadovyi said. Rumors or not, his city is still preparing for the worst, he said. “We have to prepare all our shelters -- fill it with water and medical supplies,” he said. “We are definitely in a better situation than we were at the end of February 2022,” says Andriy Hodyk, first deputy head of the Lviv Regional Military Administration. It's not just longtime residents of Lviv region who have to be protected from the possible assault from the north. There are between 250,000 to 300,000 internally displaced people living in the Lviv region, according to Hodyk. Some of them have already joined the army. “As for April, in different districts of the region up to 20% of mobilized conscripts were internally displaced people,” he said. In a series of interviews, residents and refugees in Lviv described living with a sense of unease, of feeling as though an attack could come at any day, even if there's been no indication one will come anytime soon. Valeriy, a 41-year-old sculptor from Kharkiv, who arrived in Lviv over a month ago with his disabled brother, said he is ready to defend Lviv, although his original plan was to take his brother to the European Union for treatment. “War is war. Of course -- we need to help,"" he said while standing in his temporary shelter in the middle of a local park. ""There would be a lot of people ready to defend Lviv from the possible offensive from Belarus."" Two other men at the same location have big families and different concerns. Serhiy, 42, a driver and hydrotechnical specialist from the Kherson region, managed to get to the west by driving through a mined road with his wife and four children. He and his family are now planning to head to Germany, as he was told the German government would provide decent social support for families with children. Another man, who was also named Serhiy, 37, a constructor from Cherkasy region and a father of six, said he too planned to go West: “If I were not concerned by the possibility of the offensive from Belarus, I would definitely stay here.” Meanwhile, Stanislav, 38, a father of four boys who arrived in Lviv from Slovyansk three months ago, said he was hoping his family won’t have to flee from Lviv as well “Perhaps our army will stop them or it will be the same as in my home city,” he said. Nevertheless, he said he would consider returning home but on only one condition: it being under Ukrainian control. There are still constant reminders of the closeness of the war. Around 5 million people have gone through Lviv since Feb. 24, when the invasion began, and about 150,000 have taken refuge inside the city limits, Sadovyi, the mayor, said. “We expect 50,000 to stay,” he said. He expressed deep sadness about the funerals that are being held in Lviv. Fallen soldiers -- including some men who brought their families from the east and then left to join the Ukrainian army -- have been brought back to the city for farewell ceremonies, he said. “We are burying them here as they cannot be buried in their home cities -- for instance currently occupied Mariupol or Melitopol,” he said.",17,,,,12
2022-07-07,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/fbi-director-calls-china-biggest-us-threat-authorities/story?id=86336590,FBI director calls China 'biggest' US threat; authorities warn of North Korean cyber attacks,"Speaking alongside his British counterpart in London on Wednesday, FBI Director Christopher Wray called China the ""biggest long-term threat"" to both the U.S. and the U.K. ""The Chinese government is set on stealing your technology -- whatever it is that makes your industry tick -- and using it to undercut your business and dominate your market,"" Wray said while giving remarks to international business leaders. ""And they're set on using every tool at their disposal to do it."" Wray also warned of potential tactics by Chinese officials, saying they steal technology by using intelligence officers to ""target"" valuable pieces of information and companies. ""We've even caught people affiliated with Chinese companies out in the U.S. heartland, sneaking into fields to dig up proprietary, genetically modified seeds, which would have cost them nearly a decade and billions in research to develop themselves,"" Wray said. ""And those efforts pale in comparison to their lavishly-resourced hacking program that's bigger than that of every other major country combined."" The Chinese, Wray said, use cyber to ""steal"" volumes of information. He said U.S. officials are working with MI5, the British intelligence service, to identify other investments that the Chinese government makes in proxy relationships -- a kind of third-party venue through which China steals information. Wray said that U.S. companies should be wary of working with or in China, something about which he has warned before, and he urged business leaders to contact the FBI for further information on ways to mitigate the Chinese cyber threat. His warning was the latest episode of the U.S. pushing back on what they describe as Chinese hostility. Relations between the U.S. and China have evolved since President Joe Biden took office -- his predecessor Donald Trump embarked on a trade war with the country -- and the U.S. and China remain deeply intertwined, though they are often opposed on various issues. After one call between Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping earlier this year, the Chinese Foreign Affairs Ministry said, ""The U.S.-China relationship has not yet emerged from the predicament created by the previous U.S. administration but has instead encountered more and more challenges. The U.S. side has made a misreading and misjudgment of China's strategic intentions."" On Wednesday, Wray warned that if China were to invade Taiwan, U.S. companies could see a repeat, on a much larger scale, of the economic disarray from Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the resulting international condemnation. ""Just as in Russia, Western investments built over years could become hostage capital stranded, supply chains and relationships disrupted,"" he said. ""Companies are caught between sanctions and Chinese law forbidding compliance with them. That's not just geopolitics. It's business forecasting."" Wray concluded by saying the U.S. and U.K. were working together to combat this threat. His remarks come as American law enforcement agencies and the Treasury Department cautioned the public of another overseas adversary, this one targeting hospital systems. North Korean-backed cyber actors are targeting the health care and public health sector, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), the FBI and Treasury Department said on Wednesday. These actors use Maui ransomware, a specific technology that has a North Korean hallmark, to infiltrate health care sectors and hold their systems ransom in exchange for a payment, American officials said in an advisory. The officials said that since May 2021, the agencies have observed and reacted to ""multiple"" Maui ransomware incidents indicating that they came from North Korea. ""North Korean state-sponsored cyber actors used Maui ransomware in these incidents to encrypt servers responsible for healthcare services—including electronic health records services, diagnostics services, imaging services, and intranet services,"" the advisory states. ""In some cases, these incidents disrupted the services provided by the targeted HPH Sector organizations for prolonged periods."" The agencies believe that because health care organizations ""provide services that are critical to human life and health,"" they are likely to pay ransoms when attacked. Law enforcement advise not paying the ransom and to contact CISA or the FBI instead. ""Because of this assumption, the FBI, CISA, and Treasury assess North Korean state-sponsored actors are likely to continue targeting HPH Sector organizations,"" the officials said.",3,,,,11
2022-06-30,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/International/mariupol-theater-airstrike-clear-war-crime-russian-military/story?id=85983513,"Mariupol theater airstrike was 'a clear war crime' by Russian military, Amnesty International says","LONDON -- The Russian military committed ""a clear war crime"" when its forces bombed a packed drama theater in the Ukrainian city of Mariupol in March, Amnesty International said Thursday. The London-based international human rights group published a new report documenting how the deadly blitz on the Donetsk Academic Regional Drama Theater unfolded, citing interviews with numerous survivors and witnesses as well as ""extensive digital evidence,"" which included photographs, videos, radio intercepts, satellite imagery and radar data. The report concluded that the evidence indicates the attack ""was almost certainly an airstrike carried out by the Russian military,"" with the theater as ""the intended target."" ""After months of rigorous investigation, analysis of satellite imagery and interviews with dozens of witnesses, we concluded that the strike was a clear war crime committed by Russian forces,"" Amnesty International Secretary-General Agnes Callamard said in a statement Thursday. As many as 1,500 civilians had been taking refuge in the grand, columned Donetsk Academic Regional Drama Theater in central Mariupol when it was struck on March 16, according to the Ukrainian government. Russian forces had been relentlessly bombarding the strategic port city in southeastern Ukraine since launching an invasion on Feb. 24. Satellite images taken prior to the attack showed huge, white Cyrillic letters written on the pavement in front of and behind the building, spelling out the Russian word for ""children"" -- ""deti"" -- to alert warplanes to those inside. According to Amnesty International's report, Russian fighter aircraft most likely attacked the theater-turned-shelter using two 500-kilogram bombs that struck close to each other and detonated simultaneously. The strike took place on a clear morning and landed inside the main structure of the theater, which the report noted was a cultural landmark and the only big building in the middle of a large park in Mariupol. The theater's civilian character and the presence of numerous civilians ""were evident,"" according to the report. About a week after the attack, the Mariupol City Council said the death toll was around 300, citing eyewitnesses. A subsequent investigation by The Associated Press found evidence that the strike was far deadlier than initially estimated, killing closer to 600 people inside and outside the building. The AP called it ""the single deadliest known attack against civilians to date"" in Russia's war on Ukraine. It remains unclear exactly how many people were killed, but Amnesty International said the death toll is likely much smaller than previously reported. Based on a review of witness accounts and other sources, the organization believes ""at least a dozen people died in the attack, but also that it is likely that many additional fatalities remain unreported,"" according to the report. ""Many people were injured and killed in this merciless attack. Their deaths were likely caused by Russian forces deliberately targeting Ukrainian civilians,"" Callamard said. ""The International Criminal Court, and all others with jurisdiction over crimes committed during this conflict, must investigate this attack as a war crime. All those responsible must be held accountable for causing such death and destruction."" The Russian military claimed to have fully captured Mariupol in late May, after a nearly three month siege that reduced the city of 430,000 people to smoldering ruin. The victory secured a coastal corridor between Russia and the Crimean Peninsula, which Moscow forcibly annexed from Ukraine in 2014. ""Through the air and on the ground, Russian forces have been on a well-documented and deliberate killing spree of civilians in Ukraine,"" Callamard added. ""Thorough investigations are urgently needed in order to hold perpetrators accountable for the serious injury and loss of civilian life they caused, as well as for the extensive damage to civilian infrastructure.""",17,,,,17

Alex Drueke, 40, left his home from outside Tuscaloosa, Alabama in mid-April, intending to join Ukrainian forces as a volunteer. Upon arrival, he helped train soldiers on equipment they received from other nations. Drueke last contacted his family on June 13, they said. On June 15, photos of Drueke and Andy Huynh started appearing online via Ukrainian and Russian social media that showed the men in captivity. According to Drueke's aunt, Dianna Shaw, Drueke first called the State Department Saturday from a Russian phone number. He read a statement that said the DPR wanted to negotiate the release of Drueke and Huynh. He added that he was being treated well and had shelter and water. During a second phone call on Tuesday, Drueke read a second statement from his captors regarding negotiations without specifying terms, she said. He said he was spending most of his time in solitary confinement and had not seen Huynh in several days, according to Shaw. ""We have been in contact with the Ukrainian and Russian authorities regarding U.S. citizens who may have been captured by Russia's proxies while fighting in Ukraine,"" the State Department said in a statement to ABC News. ""We are seeking to learn as much as we can and are providing every form of support possible, including for the families, with whom we are in contact. Due to privacy considerations, we have no further comment at this time."" The Kremlin has not confirmed where both men are being held. Shaw said the phone calls are evidence that ""Russia knows the world is watching"" and suggested the Russian government is playing a role in protecting the men. ""Russia has the influence over their surrogates to see that Alex and Andy are given humane treatment as POWs and eventually released unharmed,"" she said. On Friday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called both men ""heroes"" and said he would fight for their release. ""We'll fight for them and get them back, and of course they will come back to their families,"" he said. ""To me, it is a great honor that in the world there are some soldiers that are not afraid, and they came to support us and our sovereignty and independence."" In a statement, Bunny Drueke, the veteran's mother, said it was ""very encouraging to hear the Ukrainian government is committed to securing Alex's and Andy's release.""

2022-06-23,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/US/increased-threat-foreign-terrorists-election-influence-operations-2022/story?id=85598905,"'Increased threat' of foreign terrorists, election influence operations in 2022: DHS","The Department of Homeland Security recently warned that the threat from foreign terrorist organizations and cyberthreat from adversaries like Russia, including election interference, will likely increase in 2022 according to an intelligence analysis obtained by ABC News. The document, titled ""Key Threats to the Homeland in 2022"" and dated June 8, asserts that the greatest threat to the United States this year comes from lone wolf actors and small groups of individuals motived by a cadre of extremist beliefs like the alleged shooter in Buffalo, New York who is currently facing hate crimes charges for killing 10 African-American shoppers at a grocery store. Federal law enforcement agencies including the DHS and Justice Department have previously prioritized combatting domestic violent extremism since the start of the Biden administration. But DHS also warned about the potential for a resurgence of foreign terrorism due to the relaxing pandemic travel restrictions and said they will be ""highly visible"" online -- focused on messaging inspiring homegrown terrorism. ""Foreign terrorists probably will continue to hone their abilities to facilitate international travel, expand their networks, raise funds, and organize, ultimately to improve their ability to target the United States and the Homeland,"" the bulletin says. ""While some travel was very likely curtailed by COVID-19 travel restrictions, we anticipate an increased threat from these actors in 2022 as travel restrictions are relaxed."" Some with terrorist connections may seek to travel to the United States and apply for tourist visas, DHS says. ""What this assessment reinforces is other intelligence indicating that the U.S. continues to experience unacceptable levels of violence by individuals inspired by extremist content promoted online by a diverse array of foreign and domestic threat actors,"" said John Cohen, an ABC News contributor and former acting undersecretary for intelligence and analysis at DHS. ""Law enforcement officials are particularly concerned about the potential for targeted acts of violence directed at law enforcement, election, other elected officials due to increase calls for violence by domestic violent extremists."" Threats to the nation's cyberspace stem from three countries according to DHS: China, Russia and Iran, according to the assessment. Russia will continue to target U.S. critical infrastructure through various cyberattacks and sow discord in the country as it has in previous elections, according to DHS, in some cases leveraging emerging technology like artificial intelligence. ""Russian malign influence actors likely will attempt to dissuade U.S. voters from participating in the 2022 midterm elections using similar tactics employed during the 2020 and 2016 presidential elections, such as targeting audiences with false information about voting logistics, exacerbating racial tensions, and levying attacks or praise on candidates from either political party,"" the memo said. ""Russia probably could use emerging technologies to enhance its cyber and malign influence efforts when attempting to affect the outcome of U.S. elections. For instance, advancements in artificial intelligence allow for automated data analysis, classification, creation, and manipulation of digital content, which could be deployed in future foreign malign influence and disinformation campaigns."" Russia, according to the Department, embeds intelligence officers ""to establish front companies and recruit Russian emigres and American citizens to steal sensitive US academic, government, and business information."" ""It is a threat environment in which a diverse array of foreign and domestic threat actors use internet-based communication platforms to spread content intended to sow discord, inspire violence, undermine confidence in government institutions and achieve other illicit objectives,"" Cohen, the ABC News contributor, said. Chinese state-sponsored actors ""aggressively target U.S. political, economic, military, educational, and critical infrastructure personnel and organizations to steal sensitive data, key technologies, intellectual property, and personally identifiable information."" The department assessed that PRC-sponsored hacking compromised at least 30,000 organizations by exploiting an an email server, DHS says. ""We assess that the PRC will seek to engage in a range of activities to support policies favorable to Beijing and its interests and will likely prioritize messaging against US audiences in the run-up to midterm elections to influence political outcomes favorable to Beijing,"" DHS says. The malign influence campaign from China ""use at least 30 social media platforms and more than 40 websites and niche forums in several languages, including English, Russian, German, Spanish, Korean, and Japanese, to target US audiences."" Additionally, ransomware will continue to increase, according to DHS, because it has been profitable for cybercriminals. ""We assess that ransomware attacks targeting US networks and infrastructure will increase in the near and long term because cybercriminals have developed effective business models to increase their financial gain, likelihood for success, and anonymity,"" the Department says.

Peskov said they were mercenaries who made attempts on the lives of Russian service members. They are charged with mercenary practices, he said. ""The Geneva Convention absolutely does not apply to them. Their crimes must be investigated, and they must stand trial,"" Peskov said.

U.S. officials revealed they're also aware of a third American who has been reported missing during the war. U.S. lawmakers said Wednesday they have been asked by the families of the former service members from Alabama -- Alexander Drueke and Andy Tai Ngoc Huynh -- for their help in locating them. A photo that appears to show both men with their hands behind their backs also started circulating online Thursday. Rep. Terri Sewell, D-Ala., said in a statement her office is helping a family locate Drueke, 39, of Tuscaloosa, Alabama. ""Earlier this week, the mother of Alexander Drueke, a Tuscaloosa Army Veteran who volunteered to assist the Ukrainian Army in combating Russia, reached out to my office after losing contact with her son. According to his family, they have not heard from Drueke in several days,"" she said in a statement. Sewell said her office has been in contact with the State Department, the FBI and other members of the Alabama Congressional delegation. Drueke, an Army veteran, reportedly went to Ukraine in mid-April to volunteer to help train the Ukrainian forces, his mother, Lois ""Bunny"" Drueke, told ""Good Morning America."" ""He wanted to go over and help train the Ukrainian soldiers and show them how to use the equipment that the U.S. has been sending over there for them,"" she said. Drueke was a chemical operations specialist in the Army Reserve from 2002 to 2014 and held the rank of staff sergeant at the end of his service, an Army official confirmed to ABC News. He was deployed to Kuwait from December 2004 to December 2005 and to Iraq from November 2008 to July 2009, the official said. Lois Drueke said she last heard from her son in a text message on June 8. ""He said that he was going dark for a day or possibly two. And I responded to stay safe, that I loved him and he responded, 'Yes, ma'am. I love you too,'"" she said.

""They are working to verify it. We are very hopeful."" Rep. Robert Aderholt, R-Ala., said his office is helping in the search for Huynh, 27, of Trinity, Alabama, after his family reached out to the congressman's office this week. ""According to Huynh's family, they have not been in contact with him since June 8, 2022, when he was in the Kharkiv area of Ukraine,"" he said in a statement. Aderholt said his office has reached out to the State Department and FBI to ""get any information possible.""

I know there's a potential of me dying. I'm willing to give my life for what I believe is right,"" he told the station. Huynh served in the Marines from 2014 to 2018, reaching the rank of corporal, a Marine Corps spokesperson confirmed to ABC News. He got engaged in March, before he left for Ukraine the following month. ""We just really want him back,"" his fiancée, Joy Black, told ""Good Morning America"" through tears.

Price said the State Department had not had any direct communication with Russia concerning the whereabouts of the two men. ""If we feel that such outreach through our embassy in Moscow or otherwise would be productive in terms of finding out more information on the whereabouts of these individuals, we won't hesitate to do that,"" he said, adding that the department had not ""seen anything from the Russians indicating that two such individuals are in their custody."" Price said the department is also aware of a third, unidentified American who reportedly traveled to Ukraine to fight and whose ""whereabouts are unknown.""

The guide shows us around the Babi Yar memorial. Once a high-end neighborhood of Kyiv, it became a place of one of its biggest tragedies - a mass murder of Jews and gypsies by the Nazis in September 1941. According to various estimates, up to 30,000 people, including children, were shot dead or hung in this place. As the guide continues, we see how the tragic past suddenly evolves into tragic present. The group stops by a TV tower, the tallest building in the city and one of the tallest in the world. Russian missiles hit it on March 1, leaving five people dead and five wounded. The strike disrupted the work of a few Ukrainian TV channels, but the broadcast was resumed two hours after the emergency service repaired the operational center of the tower. ""Russia wanted to make us deaf and blind,"" Liudmyla, a 46-year-old resident of Kyiv, said. ""But the tower withstood. So will Kyiv and Ukraine. We need to be aware of what is going on in the city. That's why I'm happy that the excursion route includes such places."" Kyiv was hit by a barrage of missiles throughout the city from the first days of war. Since then, 150 residents have died, more than 300 have been wounded, according to the local authorities. Western intelligence predicted the fall of the city into Russian hands within 48 hours after the invasion. Instead, the Ukrainian army fought back against the Russian troops, which had to move to other areas in Ukraine in mid-March. ""When we saw that the security situation was improving, we started thinking ahead; how to turn our wounds into advantages,"" Daniil Barashkin, head of the Kyiv tourist information center told ABC News. ""The destruction always terrifies people, that's why it can be very attractive. But at the same time, when we see it, we start appreciating life more."" Now there's a route organized by the Kyiv tourist center that includes the places damaged during the Russian invasion. But the authorities plan to do more, in particular bus tours around the city to show the destroyed residential buildings and a tour around a governmental quarter, which is now heavily guarded. ""I walk in the streets and often see people, including foreigners, looking at some places and discussing how they looked before the war. People are interested in knowing more,"" Barashkin said. The first route organized by the city tourist center attracted almost 50 people. Around 30 attended the second one. ""People come themselves, just after seeing the announcement, and we can't ban them from coming. It's just so cool to see that they are so eager,"" Barashkin said. As we go, the air raid siren goes off. ""We don't hide anymore; let's continue the tour,"" one of the participants said. ""If something happens, we usually pause the tour and proceed to the nearest shelter,"" Barashkin said. ""Before adopting the route at the mayor's office, we made sure it is safe for the people."" The capital's mayor, Vitaliy Klitschko, urges people not to neglect the sirens and reiterates that although now quiet and peaceful, Kyiv is still under threat of missile strikes. ""Unfortunately, we cannot provide 100% security guarantee to those who come to Kyiv,"" he told ABC News. But people should see and remember, how the city suffered and at what price withstood the Russian attack. ""The places we show in this excursion are part of the tragic history of Ukraine, a history of our courageous fight for our cities, our country and our future. They demonstrate that Russia brings war and deaths to our land. People need to see this and never have any illusions about any 'brotherhood with Russia,"" Klitschko said. The last highlight of the excursion is the building of the Artem military concern, which was hit twice by missiles. The building is still partially damaged and uninhabited. ""It's sad and frightening,"" Iryna, a 61-year-old resident of Kyiv, said. ""However, I wouldn't even repair these buildings and leave them as a reminder of what we've come through,"" she said. ""I feel sympathy for the people who suffered due to this war. I want to go around such places and see how I could help my city,"" Ruslan, a 24-year old Kyiv resident, said. ""All these events have been a horror, but the tragedy united all the Ukrainians."" Ironically, the Artem concern, founded in the last years of the Soviet Union, was named after a famous communist Artem, who founded a puppet republic in the east of Ukraine and fought against the Ukrainian nationalists in the early 20th century. ""So it appears that my excursion route tells a bit about the Ukrainian nationalist movement that existed 100 years ago. But this is something that Russia does not recognize and is trying to destroy now, killing thousands of people in Ukraine. And show that, too,"" Vlad Balan, a tourist guide told ABC News. ""But I hope that in the future, I will take the guests around the places that demonstrate development and achievement, not death and destruction. I'm sure it will happen soon.""",17,,,,4

All three leaders called for swift acceptance of the applications amid resistance from Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who announced Thursday that his country will oppose Finland and Sweden joining the alliance. ""The bottom line is simple, quite straightforward,"" Biden said in remarks made from the Rose Garden. ""Finland and Sweden make NATO stronger, not just because of their capacity, but because of their strong democracies and a strong united NATO is the foundation of America's security."" The two nations formally submitted their applications on Wednesday as Russia's invasion of Ukraine is about to enter its fourth month, making the decision after seeing strong support from the public and the backing from their respective governments. Biden said conversations between the U.S., Finland and Sweden about Russia's aggression in Eastern Europe and NATO accession been going on for months, and that they have the ""complete backing"" of his administration. On Thursday, his administration will submit reports on accession to Congress so lawmakers can move ""efficiently and quickly"" on consenting to the expansion. Biden also appeared to have a message Thursday for Russian President Vladimir Putin, a staunch opponent of NATO expansion. ""Let me be clear: New members joining NATO is not a threat to any nation,"" Biden said. ""It never has been. NATO's purpose is to defend against aggression, that's its purpose, to defend."" Finland and Sweden's move to join the alliance is also welcomed by NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg, who said Wednesday the nations are their ""closest partners."" ""All allies agree on the importance of NATO enlargement,"" Stoltenberg said at a news conference. ""We all agree that we must stand together. And we all agree that this is an historic moment, which we must seize."" The request must be approved by all of NATO's 30 member countries, making Erdogan's objection a potential headache. ""We have told our relevant friends we would say 'no' to Finland and Sweden's entry into NATO, and we will continue on our path like this,"" Erdogan said in a video statement on Thursday. Erdogan has been critical of both countries, stating he perceives them as being supportive of groups Turkey views as extremist -- including the banned Kurdistan Workers' Party, or PKK. Both Sweden's prime minister and Finland's president addressed Turkey's disapproval during their visit to the White House.

2022-05-16,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/International/finland-sweden-set-announce-stance-nato-membership/story?id=84595411,"Sweden to apply to join NATO, joining Finland in ending nonaligned status","LONDON and HELSINKI -- Sweden will apply to formally join NATO, following in the footsteps of neighboring Finland, the country's prime minister said, ending long-held positions of neutrality in the wake of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. ""The best for our country's security is that Sweden applies for membership in NATO and that we do it now together with Finland,"" Swedish Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson said on Monday. ""And following today's debate in Parliament, the government is ready to make a decision about an application. That will be the starting point for a process that includes ratification in all the NATO member's parliaments and after that, the government will return to Parliament with a proposal for ratification for Swedish membership of NATO."" ""As nonaligned countries, Sweden and Finland have been contributing to stability in our region, but that changed when Russia invaded Ukraine,"" she added. President Sauli Niinisto and Prime Minister Sanna Marin of Finland announced their intention to apply for NATO membership on Sunday, with the country's Parliament expected to endorse the proposal as a formality. Leaders in both Sweden and Finland had long been expected to apply to join the military alliance, as the war in Ukraine continues to have unintended consequences for Russia by potentially pushing two more of its neighbors into NATO. Last week, Dmitry Peskov, Russia's presidential press secretary, said that ""another enlargement of NATO does not make our continent more stable and secure."" Peskov reiterated that stance on Monday, saying that although Russia had ""no territorial disputes"" with Sweden and Finland, unlike in Ukraine, Russia believed it to be a ""serious issue"" that they are following ""very closely."" Swedish Minister of Foreign Affairs Ann Linde said last week that Finland's leaders had delivered an ""important message,"" adding that her country ""will decide after the report from the security policy consultations has been presented."" The Scandinavian countries have long held neutral status when it comes to European conflict. Finland became a neutral country after the Second World War, while Sweden has resisted military alliances long before that. Yet fears that Russia could do to other non-NATO countries what it has done to Ukraine has sparked a rapid shift in public opinion in both countries, one of which, Finland, shares an 830-mile land border with Russia. Both could be on the cusp of joining NATO. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg has publicly said the Nordic countries would be welcomed into the alliance, however the process could take months once their formal applications have been sent in. Ahead of any official announcement from both countries for NATO membership, U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson had previously signed mutual security assurances in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. NATO's expansion would be yet another unintended consequence for Russia, as they continue to be met with fierce resistance in Ukraine and a more united West than their intelligence assessments anticipated. Part of Russia's security demands ahead of the invasion in Ukraine included reverting NATO forces to 1997 positions. Since NATO was founded in 1949, the alliance has expanded to include 30 member countries, including three former Soviet republics, and the inclusion of Sweden and Finland would further expand the alliance's influence in the Arctic and in the areas around Russia. Stoltenberg said just days ahead of the invasion ""if Kremlin's aim is to have less NATO on Russia's borders, it will only get more NATO. And if it wants to divide NATO, it will only get an even more united Alliance."" This prediction now appears to be coming true -- although Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov last month said that NATO is a ""tool sharpened for confrontation"" and it is ""not an alliance that ensures peace and stability"" when asked about Sweden and Finland. Experts say the expansion will be evidence of yet another strategic blunder on Russia's part. Even as public opinion has shifted, there are still those that opposes NATO membership for the Nordic countries, fearing it would lead to increased tensions with Russia. ""I'm afraid that NATO membership will increase actually the tensions in the Baltic Sea region and also will increase the tensions in Finland, especially regarding the eastern border,"" Veronika Honkasalo, one of the few members of Finland's parliament who doesn't believe the country should join, told ABC News. Furthermore, there are concerns that Sweden and Finland could be vulnerable to Russian attacks during the application process, though State Department spokesperson Ned Price moved to reassure both countries last week, saying: ""I am certain that we will find ways to address concerns they may have regarding the period between the potential application and the final ratification."" However, polling reported in both countries appears to show a significant majority are in favor of NATO membership. ""[Putin] has for years said Finland and Sweden joining is a red line,"" Charly Salonius-Pasternak, lead researcher at the Finnish Institute of International Affairs, told ABC News. ""He's managed to drive both Finland and Sweden towards NATO. So I think a massive miscalculation for him, but I think a positive thing for the rest of Europe."" ""It's very clearly the population that changed its opinion in, say, six months, radically so,"" he said, adding that the shift in public opinion had a snowball effect into Sweden, as fears grew about what could happen without the umbrella protection of NATO membership as the war in Ukraine continued. ""Now Russia has gone so far that joining NATO seems to be the only genuine solution here,"" he said.",29,,,,15

The civilian was a resident of Chupakhivka who was riding a bike on the roadside when he was shot, Venediktova alleged. Shishmarin is charged with murder and two counts of robbery. He surrendered to Ukrainian law enforcement on the same day and has been a prisoner of war since, Ukrainian prosecutor Andriy Syniuk said. Shishmarin's lawyer and a public defender, Viktor Ovsiannikov, refused to disclose his strategy, but said the fact the soldier was following orders does not legally constitute a defense. It’s up to the judges whether to take that under consideration. The length of the trial will depend on how the defendant will plead, but the prosecution has sufficient proof regardless, Syniuk told ABC News. Syniuk also said Shishmarin has cooperated throughout the investigation. Shishimarin is the first member of the Russian military to be facing a criminal trial, Venediktova said in a post on Facebook. Prosecutor Andriy Syniuk told ABC News that trying this case should set the standard and prove that Ukraine is a country with a rule of law and respect for human rights. He said this case is important and that more hearings will be starting soon. Three other people are involved in these crimes, but Shishmarin is the only one facing charges for now, according to the prosecutor. ABC News' Tatiana Rymarenko contributed to this report.",13,,,,23
2022-05-12,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/International/helsinkis-underground-city-reflects-tense-position-russias-neighbor/story?id=84668764,Helsinki's 'underground city' reflects tense position as Russia's neighbor,"HELSINKI -- Finland may be world's happiest country -- at least on the surface. But Helsinki's ""underground city"" tells a different story. Beneath the capital, a massive network of bunkers and tunnels spreads out all across the city. There are than 5,000 bomb shelters in Helsinki -- enough to shelter more than the city's entire population -- and more than 50,000 bunkers across the country, according to Helsinki's Civil Defense Department. All buildings above a certain size are required by law to have their own bunkers. ""There's a historic sense that you should always be prepared. It might not be this generation or the next generation, but Russia is likely to attack Finland in some way,"" said Charly Salonius-Pasternak, a leading researcher at the Finnish Institute for International Affairs. With so much ground going unutilized, the city of Helsinki has converted some of its shelters into spaces for everyday public use. There's an underground playground, a shelter that doubles as a hockey rink, even an underground swimming pool. This is what it's like being Russia's neighbor. The two countries share an 800-mile border and a long, complicated history. For decades, Finland opted not to join any military alliance in an effort meant to appease Russia's security concerns. As a result, Finland had to ensure it could fend for itself. So it's not just the bunkers; conscription is still mandatory for men, and the country has about 900,000 reservists. ""We have to take care of the citizens, that's the main reason we have this system,"" said Tomi Rask, an instructor with Helsinki's Civil Defense Department. But the very scenarios Finland has spent years preparing for are now playing out in Ukraine, where some have been living underground for weeks. The invasion marked a turning point for Finland-Russia relations. Public support in Finland for joining NATO is skyrocketing from roughly 30% before the war to more than 70% in the weeks after the invasion. ""We have such a horrible neighbor on the east side of Finland. We don't have any other option than to go to NATO,"" said said Finland citizen Kare Vartiainen, who ABC News met making use of the underground pool. After years of neutrality, on Thursday, Finland's leaders announced Finland should apply to join NATO ""without delay."" Sweden is expected to follow suit. The country's accession would more than double Russia's land border with NATO. It would also expand NATO's influence in the Arctic and further unify the West, said Salonius-Pasternak. NATO would also grow stronger. ""NATO would now have two more old democratic countries, both with really capable militaries, so that effectively all of northern Europe would now be one region to defend,"" he said. There are those that are still skeptical, like Veronika Honkasalo, one of the few members of Parliament who doesn't think Finland should join. MPs are expected to take up the issue next week. ""I'm afraid that NATO membership will increase actually the tensions in the Baltic Sea region and also will increase the tensions in Finland, especially regarding the eastern border,"" she said. Russia has already threatened ""serious military and political consequences"" if Finland and Sweden join NATO, saying it will have to bolster its defenses in the region and that it could decide to place nuclear weapons in the Baltics. There are concerns about what could happen in the time period after Finland and Sweden submit their applications but before they formally join the alliance. The two countries now hoping to win over security assurances from allies, including the U.S. On Thursday, U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson pledged to come to Finland and Sweden's aid if either nation is attacked. Finns say now is the time to act while Putin is busy with Ukraine. The war in Ukraine is prompting Finland, even with its 50,000 shelters and capable military, to decide it can no longer go it alone. It's likely giving Putin the very thing he worked so hard to prevent: NATO's expansion. ""We are a small nation, we need help, we need friends. And from my point of view, maybe NATO is the friend that we need,"" said Rask.",29,,,,15
2022-05-10,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/putin-prepping-prolonged-conflict-donbas-escalate-nuclear-threats/story?id=84626300,"Putin prepping 'prolonged conflict' beyond Donbas, could escalate nuclear threats: Top US intel official","Russian President Vladimir Putin is preparing for a ""prolonged conflict"" in Ukraine, and could resort to drastic measures if the fighting doesn't go his way, according to Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines. During a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing Tuesday, Haines said Putin's invasion of Ukraine has sent a shock through the geopolitical order, ""with implications for the future that we are only beginning to understand, but are sure to be consequential."" Though Putin has focused his forces on Donbas after failing in the north, the U.S. does not believe he will be content with the eastern part of the country, Haines said. ""The next month or two of fighting will be significant as the Russians attempt to reinvigorate their efforts. But even if they are successful, we are not confident that the fight in the Donbas will effectively end the war,"" she said. ""We assess President Putin is preparing for prolonged conflict in Ukraine during which he still intends to achieve goals beyond the Donbas."" But for now Putin's goal is to take control of the Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts in Donbas and encircle Ukrainian forces from the north and south ""in order to crush the most capable and well-equipped Ukrainian forces who are fighting to hold the line in the East,"" Haines said. Putin would also like to ""consolidate control of the land bridge Russia has established from Crimea to the Donbas, occupy Kherson, and control the water source for Crimea,"" she said. The U.S. also sees signs his military wants to extend that land bridge to Transnistria, in Moldova, according to Haines. Haines said Russia might be capable of achieving ""most"" of those goals in the coming months, but would need to mobilize more troops to achieve the last: ""We believe that they will not be able to extend control over a land bridge that stretches to Transnistria and includes Odessa without launching some form of mobilization. And it is increasingly unlikely that they will be able to establish control over both oblasts and the buffer zone they desire in the coming weeks,"" Haines said. But Putin is ""probably counting on U.S. and EU resolve to weaken as food shortages, inflation, energy prices get worse,"" she added. Economic forces are at work in Russia as well, with sanctions from the West having a ""pretty significant"" impact on Russia, according to Haines. ""Among the indicators that one might look at are, for example, the fact that ... we predict approximately 20% inflation in Russia, that we expect that their GDP will fall about 10%, possibly even more, over the course of the year,"" she said. The fighting itself has also worn on Russia's capabilities. ""Our view is that the ground combat forces have been degraded considerably. It's going to take them years ... to rebuild that,"" she said. But degraded conventual forces could drive Putin to other means of exerting force. ""That may end up meaning that they have greater reliance in effect on asymmetric tools during this period,"" Haines said. ""So they may rely more on things like cyber, nuclear, precision, etc. And that's obviously a shift in the way in which they are exercising their efforts for influence."" The discrepancy between Putin's high aspirations and his degraded conventional capability could lead to ""a more unpredictable and potentially escalatory trajectory,"" and ""a period of more ad-hoc decision making in Russia"" in the next few months, Haines said. This could also manifest itself domestically. ""The current trend increases the likelihood that President Putin will turn to more drastic means, including imposing martial law, reorienting industrial production, or potentially escalatory military actions to free up the resources needed to achieve his objectives as the conflict drags on, or if he perceives Russia is losing in Ukraine,"" she said. What could happen next? ""The most likely flashpoints for escalation in the coming weeks are around increasing Russian attempts to interdict Western security assistance, retaliation for Western economic sanctions or threats to the regime at home. We believe that Moscow continues to use nuclear rhetoric to deter the United States and the West from increasing lethal aid to Ukraine and to respond to public comments of the U.S. and NATO allies that suggest expanded Western goals in the conflict,"" she said. The next step for Putin could be to launch major nuclear drills to command respect from the U.S. ""If Putin perceives that the United States is ignoring his threats, he may try to signal to Washington the heightened danger of its support to Ukraine by authorizing another large nuclear exercise involving a major dispersal of mobile intercontinental missiles, heavy bombers, strategic submarines,"" Haines said. But so far U.S. officials have said they do not believe Russia is preparing to actually use nuclear weapons in Ukraine or elsewhere. ""We otherwise continue to believe that President Putin would probably only authorize the use of nuclear weapons if he perceived an existential threat to the Russian state or regime,"" Haines said.",14,,,,10
2022-05-09,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/secret-service-jill-biden-ukraine-analysis/story?id=84598285,How the Secret Service got Jill Biden to Ukraine: ANALYSIS,"First lady Jill Biden made news when she conducted an unannounced visit to western Ukraine on Sunday. The first lady traveled by vehicle to the town of Uzhhorod, which was about a 10-minute drive from the Slovakian border, and spent about two hours in Ukraine. Considering that the entire nation is gripped in a war with Russia, and the United States had pulled out its diplomatic staff, closed its Embassy and has no real resources in the country, this type of a visit is difficult and dangerous. Since it began protecting presidents, the United States Secret Service has escorted the president and other high-ranking government officials into war zones, disaster areas and places in extreme distress. Whether during World War II with President Franklin Delano Roosevelt visiting troops on the front lines of battle, bringing President Lyndon B. Johnson to Vietnam during the war, or both President George W. Bush and Barack Obama’s trips to Iraq and Afghanistan, despite the overwhelming security risks, the Secret Service has always managed to make these trips happen and keep the protectees safe. This all starts with planning and the Secret Service advance process. Any trip a Secret Service protectee embarks on, domestic or overseas, begins with the advance. In the case of the first lady, this likely included close coordination between the Secret Service and White House staff to determine the destination, scope and duration of any visit. Once those decisions are made, the security planning begins and often includes counterparts from different federal and state agencies. In the case of a foreign advance, where neither the Secret Service nor the U.S. government has any real authority, a liaison is established with the host country's security forces via the Secret Service offices located in that geographic area, and the U.S. State Department and its Diplomatic Security Services (DSS) Regional Security Offices. Depending on the nature of the visit, the host country is typically notified via diplomatic notice of the impending visit of a United States dignitary. In cases where the nature of the visit has real security concerns, such as in a war zone, that notification is typically made at the highest levels, specifically the ambassador. The visit information is typically closely held so that the dissemination of any information that may be advantageous to an adversary is minimized. This includes the use of secure communication methods between the White House, State Department and Secret Service. One of the overriding security and logistics concerns for these types of visits is the ability to tap into or transport in U.S. military and Secret Service assets to support the visit. In places where the U.S. military has a presence or can operate, the support and logistics are made easier. In the case of a location where neither of those resources is available -- as is the case in Ukraine, the Secret Service must work with the local security forces and make decisions about what level of support they can provide and what, if any, Secret Service support they will permit. Often these visits use elements of clandestine operations in order to preserve the protective methodology the Secret Service uses to transport the protectee to the location and specific locations of the visit. These clandestine methods include ""covers for action"" and diversions for, in this case, the first lady’s schedule and movements, as well as for the Agents and military assets assigned to support the visit. These assets may include vehicles, extra personnel, communications gear and robust tactical units such as the Secret Service Counter Assault Team (CAT), DSS Mobile Security Deployment (MSD) and U.S. Military Special Operations. All of this is to ensure that both the Secret Service and host nation can secure a safe visit for the protectee and that any adversaries' ability to compromise the methods used for creating that visit remain classified.

2022-05-08,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/International/russia-suffered-loss-extraordinary-number-generals/story?id=84545931,Why Russia has suffered the loss of an 'extraordinary' number of generals,"During its war in Ukraine, Russia's top military leadership has proven to be particularly vulnerable, experts say. Ukraine's Ministry of Defense has claimed that 12 Russian generals have been killed since the invasion began in late February. Russian officials have not confirmed that number. U.S. officials -- who last week pushed back on a New York Times report that said the U.S. provided Ukraine intelligence that helped it target and kill Russian generals and other senior officers -- also have not confirmed the number of Russian generals killed. Though, as reported by Ukraine, that kind of loss is ""quite extraordinary,"" ABC News contributor and retired Col. Steve Ganyard said. ""Maybe you'd have to go back to World War II to have that sort of proportion of senior officers being killed on the front lines,"" Ganyard said. Such a high number of casualties at that level suggests several things -- one being a lack of confidence among Russian military leaders in their troops, according to Ganyard. ""It suggests that the generals need to be at the front lines to ensure that their troops are conducting the battle plan in the way that they want,"" he said. ""But that also suggests a lack of confidence in their troops if they need to be that far forward with that many senior folks."" That demonstrates Russia's seriousness about its campaign but is also ""an indication of how weak the Russian military has turned out to be in that they need that much senior leadership that far forward,"" Ganyard said. Russian generals also may be especially vulnerable due to the structure of Russia's military, experts say. Unlike the U.S. military, Russia does not empower its non-commissioned and junior officers with the authority to make decisions on their own, said Mick Mulroy, a former deputy assistant secretary of defense for the Middle East and an ABC News contributor. ""They do not delegate authority. So, they are out giving orders directly to their forces,"" Mulroy said. ""The lack of delegation is another reason the Russian military is performing so poorly."" Poor morale among Russian troops may also be giving Ukraine an advantage in the war, despite Ukrainians being outnumbered by enemy troops and military equipment, Ganyard said. ""As soon as communication breaks down … the young folks in the Russian military don't know what to do and they know that they're just being told to do something, particularly when it's a fight where their heart isn't in it,"" he said. ""That is an advantage that Ukraine has proven to be decisive on the battlefield thus far."" Russian troops have also been shown to be vulnerable to electronic eavesdropping while on the ground in Ukraine, Ganyard said. ""One of the many failures of the Russian military in this war is that it has shown how little they have invested in command and control capabilities,"" he said. ""The Russians aren't even using encryption, so it means that anybody -- if they find the frequency -- are able to listen in."" There are ""very credible reports"" of Russian troops even confiscating phones from Ukrainian citizens and using those for command and control operations, Ganyard said. ""So obviously, the Ukrainians can tap into their own phone lines if they can figure out who's doing it,"" he said. Russian soldiers have also been tracked in real-time through geolocation of social media posts, Ganyard said. ""The modern age has introduced lots of benefits, but in the case of the military, it actually becomes dangerous because most of the apps that people are running are not encrypted and they're passing real-time data of where people are,"" he said. Tracking Russian troops could lead Ukrainian forces to command posts -- and likely top military leadership. ""If you shell and you take out a command post, you're probably going to take out quite a bit of senior leadership,"" Ganyard said. Amid the claims of Russia's military leadership losses, it is unclear what the Ukrainian military has similarly suffered. ""The Ukrainians have been very good at controlling the narrative on social media and on media in general,"" Ganyard said. ""We're getting anecdotal reporting back-channel that the Ukrainians are paying a price, too."" And with a smaller military, the Ukrainians ""can pay a price less than the Russians can,"" he added. ""The Ukrainians are hurting,"" Ganyard said. ""This is not something where the Ukrainians are not taking any losses, while the Russians are.""

2022-04-22,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/battle-donbas-weapons-us-rushing-ukraine-critical/story?id=84173580,The battle for Donbas: Why the weapons the US is rushing to Ukraine are so critical,"As Russia's military gears up for what it hopes will be a decisive victory over Ukraine in the eastern part of the country, the U.S. is rushing to send weapons and equipment needed to hold off the larger invading force in the rural and open Donbas terrain -- a far different battlefield from the urban fighting where Ukrainian forces held an advantage. What could make all the difference now is the new $800 million military aid package for Ukraine President Joe Biden announced Thursday. It's a race against time -- maybe a matter of weeks, a U.S. defense official said. ""Now they've launched and refocused their campaign to seize new territory in eastern Ukraine, and we're in a critical window now of time where they're going to set the stage for the next phase of this war,"" Biden said of the Russian offensive, which U.S. military officials believe is just getting started. ""We know that time is not our friend,"" Pentagon press secretary John Kirby told reporters Tuesday. Russia gains by being closer to its border With Ukrainian forces focused in the east, Russia intends to push down from the north, near the city of Izium, and up from the south, surrounding the Ukrainian defenders to ""finish them or force them to surrender,"" a senior U.S. official said Thursday. If Russia takes the beleaguered city of Mariupol in the south, it could free up thousands of troops to join the push north to trap Ukraine forces, according to the official. Although Russia and Ukraine have been battling over Donbas for eight years, Russia's concentrated flow of troops and weapons into the region could bring ""a whole different level of fighting,"" Kirby said Tuesday. There are now 85 battalion tactical groups (BTGs), Russia's main fighting units, inside Ukraine, according to the official. Each BTG is made up of roughly 800-1,000 troops. About 10 of them crossed into the country this week, most heading to the Donbas region. Kirby said the U.S. is focused on sending Ukraine weapons and systems that are not only useful for the rural eastern terrain, but that the Ukrainians can use in the fight without much training. Russia, meanwhile, is trying not to repeat blunders it committed in northern Ukraine, and will enjoy certain geographic advantages in Donbas. Early on, Russian invaders in the north were beset by supply problems, running out of food for troops and fuel for vehicles, failing to achieve any major victories. Pentagon officials believe they did not expect such strong resistance from Ukrainians so didn't adequately prepare for a prolonged fight. But since withdrawing its troops in the north to focus on Donbas, Russia has been putting equipment and support forces in place ahead of its combat troops to favorably condition the battlefield. ""We believe that they are trying to learn from past mistakes, and you can see that in just the way they are conducting these shaping operations,"" Kirby told reporters Monday. ""They're conducting themselves in ways that we didn't see around Kyiv, for instance."" Another advantage for Russia is that its logistics will be simplified by fighting closer to its own border, while Ukraine will now face the challenge of transporting heavy weapons and ammunition coming over its western border all the way across the country, meaning more miles for something to go wrong, and more chances for Russia to strike these vital shipments. How US-provided artillery and radars could make a difference To stand a chance fighting in the open Donbas landscape, Ukraine will need more long-range weapons and the ability to quickly move troops on the ground and in the air, according to Mick Mulroy, former deputy assistant secretary of defense for the Middle East and ABC News contributor. The U.S. has sent Ukraine $3.4 billion of aid since the beginning of the invasion, including many thousands of shoulder-fired missiles, small arms and ammunition, body armor, and medical supplies. The two most recent packages, dedicating $800 million of aid each, announced April 13 and 21, were tailored to reflect the new battle space. ""It's different,"" Biden said Thursday. ""It’s flat, it's not in the mountains, and it requires different kinds of weapons to be more effective."" To that end, the U.S. is sending 90 of its 155mm howitzers, which officials say will begin arriving over the weekend. ""This is going to be the king of battle out there,"" Mulroy said. While Ukraine already has Russian-made artillery pieces, the U.S. and most Western nations do not have the corresponding 152mm ammunition to offer as it runs through its limited stockpiles. The incoming U.S.-made 155mm guns will bring Ukrainian forces extra firepower, but also the ability to be better resupplied by the West. To start, the U.S. is sending 184,000 artillery rounds along with the 90 weapons. Russia has been flowing its own artillery into Donbas in preparation for its renewed offensive. To help Ukraine counter the threat, the U.S. is sending 14 radar systems that can detect incoming artillery and other indirect-fire attacks and find where they're coming from. ""Right now the Russians are kind of just lobbing artillery without any consequence,"" Mulroy said. ""They want to give them a whole lot of consequence."" The radar systems can help the Ukrainians accurately fire back. ""The counter radar is moving to theater this week,"" a senior U.S. defense official said Thursday, adding that the howitzers and radar systems complement each other, but can also be used independently. Training will be critical About 50 Ukrainians are being trained on the U.S. howitzers outside of the country. This first group of trainees is expected to finish around the same time as the first artillery pieces arrive in their country, likely Sunday or Monday, according to a U.S. official. The U.S. is using a ""train-the-trainer"" approach so as not to pull too many high-demand troops away from the front -- the small group of Ukrainians learning to use the new systems will return to their country to train fellow Ukrainian troops there. The U.S. took a similar approach with the small, explosive Switchblade drones, hundreds of which are headed to Ukraine. A small number of Ukrainians were in the U.S. for pre-scheduled military education when Russia invaded their country. The U.S. capitalized on their presence to add a couple days of training on the Switchblades, which are designed to fly directly into targets and explode. ""Although it's not a very difficult system to operate, we took advantage of having them in the country to give them some rudimentary training on that,"" a U.S. defense official said on April 6. U.S. officials have said other systems being sent to Ukraine will also require a small period of training, likely to also take place outside of the country. Officials have declined to specify where such training could take place, citing operational security concerns. With Russia intent on surrounding and trapping Ukrainian forces, the ability to move troops quickly by ground and air will be essential, according to Mulroy. ""They're going to try to envelope the Ukrainians and cut them off and starve them,"" he said. ""So, the Ukrainians need to have the ability not to let that happen."" Since the beginning of the invasion, the U.S. has given Ukraine 16 Mi-17 transport helicopters, each able to carry a three-person crew and up to 30 passengers. Mulroy said an advantage of the Soviet-designed Mi-17 is that Ukrainian pilots already know how to fly them. The U.S. has also offered Ukraine hundreds of armored personnel carriers that have tracks similar to those of tanks, as well as armored Humvees. Weather will likely play a factor, and muddy conditions during Spring could limit vehicle mobility for both sides. ""Even just this week, the ground as it is makes it harder for them to operate off of paved roads and highways,"" Kirby said. Time is of the essence Mulroy said the U.S. is doing a great job shipping military aid to the region, but believes more can be done to speed things up. ""We just have to take every opportunity to increase production and improve the flow, because it is going to make a difference,"" he said. The U.S. has not sent Ukraine any of its M1 Abrams tanks, officials saying they are too different from Ukraine's T-72s to be useable in the short term. But other nations with the Soviet-era tanks have given theirs. In total, Ukrainian forces have more tanks in their country than Russia's military, a senior U.S. defense official said Thursday. A less tangible but very real factor in the fighting so far has been troop morale. The Pentagon sees evidence Russian forces are still suffering from low motivation and poor unit cohesion, according to officials. ""Almost half of their enlisted troops are conscripts who don't receive a lot of training and who we have evidence, even recent evidence, that they've been disillusioned by this war,"" the senior U.S. defense official said. Meanwhile Russian officers are frustrated with the performance of other officers and of their own troops, according to the official. Ukrainian troops have not seemed to suffer any significant morale problems, and throughout the war have been described by U.S. officials as brave and wily in defense of their homeland. Biden praised the resolve of Ukrainians in a meeting with top military leaders at the White House Wednesday. ""I knew they were tough and proud, but I tell you what, they're tougher and more proud than I thought,"" Biden said.",14,,,,1
2022-04-21,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/International/russians-calling-ukrainians-lay-arms-civilians-sheltering/story?id=84188159,"Situation in Azovstal steel plant 'desperate,' Ukraine says","Ukraine claimed on Thursday that hundreds of people remain trapped in the Azovstal steel plant where the situation has become ""desparate."" Ukraine's Ministry of Foreign Affairs claimed the Ukrainian army continues to fight in the besieged Mariupol, saying that the situation in Azovstal is ""desparate"" with hundreds of civilians, children and injured fighters trapped in the plant with nearly no food, water or essential medicine. ""Azovstal is being constantly bombarded by Russia despite large numbers of civilians sheltering there. Ukrainians don't trust [Russian] troops, are afraid of being deported, killed. An urgent humanitarian corridor is needed from the Azovstal plant with guarantees people will be safe,"" the Ukrainian MFA said in a tweet. Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered Russian troops not to attack the Azovstal plant, in a televised meeting with defense minister Sergei Shoigu. Shoigu said it would take Russian forces three to four days to take control of the industrial zone of the plant. Putin also claimed the Mariupol operation a success, congratulating his defense minister and thanking Russian troops. ""The completion of the combat work to liberate Mariupol is a success,"" Putin told Shoigu on Thursday. ""I congratulate you. Convey words of gratitude to the troops."" Ukraine's presidential adviser Oleksiy Arestovich addressed Putin's comments in a press conference Thursday and said that Ukrainian troops continue to hold the plant and Russia would not storm Azovstal because they have suffered huge losses and redeployed some of their troops. A Ukrainian commander of the regiment at that factory said Ukrainian troops there are ready to surrender if they can be guaranteed protection by a third party and are allowed to take the bodies of their dead with them. Ukrainian President Volodomyr Zelenskyy's office called for negotiations inside Mariupol to get anyone left in the factory out of the area alive. President Joe Biden pushed back against Putin's claim that Russian forces have taken control of Mariupol. ""It's questionable whether he does control Mariupol. One thing for sure we know about Mariupol, he should allow humanitarian corridors to let people on that steel mill and other places are buried under rubble to get out. That's what any head of state would do in such a circumstance,"" Biden said. ""There is no evidence yet that Mariupol has completely fallen,"" he added. On Wednesday, Russia's military issued another warning to Ukrainian forces at the plant, telling them to lay down their arms and leave, according to Russian state media. Russia claimed a ceasefire would begin at the Azovstal steel plant at 2 p.m. Moscow time on Wednesday to allow Ukrainian fighters to safely leave. Ukrainian forces rejected a similar offer on Tuesday. The Mariupol city council claimed Tuesday that there are at least 1,000 civilians seeking shelter in the plant, mostly women with children and the elderly. Ukrainian authorities have not confirmed the number of Ukrainian marines and fighters at the site. A Russian official, Dmitry Polyansky, accused Ukrainian troops of using civilians at the plant as human shields. ""One month into the siege of Azovstal plant, those same radicals and neo-Nazis suddenly declared that allegedly there had been civilians inside the plant all that time, even though until yesterday, they had never uttered a word about it,"" Polyansky told the U.N. Security Council during a session on Ukraine on Tuesday. In a video posted online, Serhiy Voyna, the commander of the 36th Separate Marine Brigade and commander for Ukraine's marines in Mariupol, made an appeal to world leaders, asking for an extraction from the plant to the territory of a third-party state. ""This could be the last appeal of our lives. We are probably facing our last days, if not hours. The enemy is outnumbering us 10 to 1. They have advantage in the air, in artillery, in their forces on land, in equipment and in tanks,"" Voyna said. Voyna spoke to the Washington Post via satellite phone on Tuesday, and said his forces would not make the same mistake made by others and trust Russian guarantees of safe passage, only to see them open fire. Voyna said more than 500 Mariupol military battalion soldiers are wounded. ""We are only defending one object, the Azovstal plant where, in addition to military personnel, there are also civilians who have fallen victim to this war. We appeal and plead to all world leaders to help us. We ask them to use the procedure of 'extraction' and take us to the territory of a third-party state,"" Voyna said.",17,,,,13
2022-04-19,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/russian-offensive-limited-fall-mariupol-inevitable-pentagon-update/story?id=84171542,"Russian offensive 'limited' so far, fall of Mariupol 'not inevitable': Pentagon update Day 55","The Pentagon has been providing daily updates on the U.S. assessment of the Russian invasion of Ukraine and Ukraine's efforts to resist. Here are highlights of what a senior U.S. defense official told reporters Tuesday on Day 55. 'Limited' Russian offensive operations so far in eastern Ukraine The U.S. has seen ""limited"" Russian offensive operations southwest of Donetsk and south of Izium, but these are believed to be ""preludes to larger offensive operations that the Russians plan to conduct,"" a senior U.S. defense official said. ""These are actual ground offensives, and they are being supported, of course, by some long-range fires, mostly artillery, which is right out of the Russian doctrine,"" the official said. But while there is ongoing fighting in the region, a more devastating offensive is still in the works. ""You've seen comments by [Ukraine's] President Zelenskyy yesterday, and even for [Russian Foreign Minister] Lavrov, about this new offensive beginning ... We think that these ... are preludes to larger offensive operations that the Russians plan to conduct. So, we're not pushing back on the notion that offensive operations have begun, but again, we think that this is a prelude of larger offensive operations that are potentially still in the offing here,"" the official said. The Pentagon believes Russia's military is working to learn from its mistakes fighting in the north, where it was plagued with logistical and supply problems, conducting what officials call ""shaping operations"" to set favorable conditions on the battlefield before beginning its new offensive in earnest. ""In other words, continue to reinforce, continue to make sure they have logistics and sustainment in place, continue to make sure that they have proper aviation and other enabling capability,"" the official said. Over the last 24 hours, two Russian battalion tactical groups (BTGs), or up to 2,000 more combat troops, have been sent into Ukraine, according to the official. This brings the total to an estimated 78 BTGs inside the country, all in the south and east. About 75% of Putin's total combat power originally arrayed against Ukraine remains, according to the official. This takes into account all military capabilities, including troop casualties, destroyed vehicles and aircraft, and expended missiles. This is the lowest assessment we've heard out of the Pentagon. Fall of Mariupol and Donbas 'not inevitable' ""People speak about this as if it's inevitable, that Mariupol is going to fall, that it's inevitable that Donbas will be taken by the Russians. We don't see it that way. And we're doing everything we can to make sure that it's not inevitable,"" the official said. With fighting concentrated around Donbas, Ukraine has to move aid coming in from the U.S. and others all the way across the country. ""Right now we know from our discussions with the Ukrainians that they are getting this materiel, it's getting into the hands of their fighters,"" the official said. But Russia aims to isolate Ukrainian forces in the east. ""Clearly what the Russians want to do is cut them off and to defeat them in the Donbas,"" the official said, reiterating that defeat is not inevitable. Ukraine has more operable planes than 2 weeks ago At a separate briefing later Tuesday, Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said Ukraine currently has more operable military planes right now than it did two weeks ago because Ukraine has received additional aircraft as well as parts to get damaged planes flying again. Kirby was reticent to provide any details on where the parts and planes came from but stressed that they did not come from the U.S. ""They have received additional aircraft and aircraft parts to help them get more aircraft in the air,"" Kirby said at the on-camera briefing at the Pentagon. “And that's not by accident, that's because other nations who had experience with those kinds of aircraft have been able to help them get more aircraft up and running,” said Kirby. ""We certainly have helped with the trans-shipment of some additional spare parts that have helped with their aircraft needs, but we have not transported whole aircraft,"" he said. Russian missile strikes The U.S. assesses Russia has fired at least 1,670 missiles against Ukraine since the beginning of the invasion. The official noted that bad weather lowers visibility, making it harder for the U.S. to observe launches and other battlefield actions, so the actual number could be higher. Despite the recent airstrikes in Kyiv and Lviv, Russia's firepower is focused on Mariupol and Donbas.",14,,,,1
2022-04-19,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/International/russia-begins-long-feared-offensive-ukraines-east/story?id=84161008,Russia begins long-feared offensive in Ukraine's east,"LONDON -- Russia launched an all-out ground offensive to take control of eastern Ukraine late Monday, marking the long-feared start of a new phase of the nearly two-month-long war. Ukrainian officials said Russian forces were attacking along a nearly 300-mile front in the disputed Donbas region, the predominately Russian-speaking industrial heartland of Ukraine's east, where Russia-backed separatists have been fighting Ukrainian soldiers since 2014 and have declared two independent republics recognized by Moscow. ""Russian troops have begun the battle for Donbas, for which they have been preparing for a long time,"" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy announced late Tuesday in his nightly broadcast. ""A very large part of the entire Russian army is now focused on this offensive."" Since invading neighboring Ukraine on Feb. 24 from Belarus, to the north, and Russia, to the east, Russian forces have struggled to take full control of major cities amid strong resistance from Ukrainian troops. After failing to seize the capital, Kyiv, Russian forces retreated from northern Ukraine and have been regrouping in the east in recent weeks in preparation for a full-scale assault, as Russian officials declared ""liberating"" the Donbas as the main goal of the ""special military operation."" On Tuesday morning, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov announced that ""another stage of this operation is beginning."" ""I am sure this will be a very important moment of this entire special operation,"" Lavrov said in an interview with India Today, an English-language Indian television network. Lavrov noted that the objective, ""as it was declared from the very start,"" was to ""fully liberate"" the self-proclaimed Donetsk and Luhansk people's republics in the Donbas. The Russian military called on the outnumbered Ukrainian fighters in the besieged port city of Mariupol in eastern Ukraine's Donetsk Oblast to surrender by midday. The Russian Ministry of Defense said it was ready to declare a temporary ceasefire in Mariupol on Tuesday from 1:30 p.m. local time. Col. Gen. Mikhail Mizintsev, head of Russia's National Defense Control Center, told Russian state media on Tuesday that Ukrainian troops holed up on the grounds of the Azovstal Iron and Steel Works plant in Mariupol had until 12 p.m. local time to stop all fighting and lay down their arms. Moscow has proposed this plan ""given the catastrophic situation in the Azovstal Iron and Steel Works, as well as for purely humanitarian considerations,"" according to Mizintsev. ""All those who will lay down arms are guaranteed that their lives will be spared,"" he added. ""The actual start of the temporary ceasefire shall be marked by both sides by raising flags -- red flags by the Russian side and white flags by the Ukrainian side along the entire perimeter of Azovstal. Furthermore, their readiness to put the temporary ceasefire into effect shall be confirmed by the sides via all communication channels."" According to Mizintsev, ""absolutely all"" Ukrainian troops and foreign mercenaries would have been allowed to leave the plant without any weapons or ammunition from 2 p.m. to 4 p.m. local time. Moscow guaranteed to each Ukrainian soldier who surrenders that their life will be spared and their rights as prisoners of war will be respected, Mizintsev said. The territory of the giant Azovstal plant is the last holdout for the Ukrainian resistance in Mariupol. The Mariupol City Council has previously said there are at least 1,000 people, including Ukrainian troops, on the grounds of the plant. Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said Monday that civilians, including women and children, were also sheltering there. She called for an ""urgent humanitarian corridor"" to allow them to evacuate. Eduard Basurin, a spokesperson for the militia of the self-declared Donetsk People's Republic, told Russian state media on Tuesday that separatist special forces were chosen to assist the Russian military in storming the Azovstal plant. Basurin said they have already started the operation in Mariupol, with Russian forces providing air and artillery support. The Ukrainian government did not immediately confirm the claim. However, Ukrainian military spokesperson Oleksandr Shtupun said Tuesday that Russian forces were intensifying their attacks in the east, with a focus on breaching Ukrainian defenses in the Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts, as well as establishing full control of Mariupol. Weeks of relentless Russian bombardment have largely reduced Mariupol to rubble and killed thousands of residents, according to local officials. Capturing the city -- a strategically important port on the Sea of Azov, part of the Black Sea -- is the remaining obstacle to Russia's push to secure a coastal corridor to Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula, which Russian forces invaded and subsequently annexed in 2014. Earlier this month, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg warned that a full-scale ground offensive by Russia in Ukraine's east would be ""a crucial phase of the war.""",17,,,,12

The U.S., China, India and Russia have all carried out such tests, which generate dangerous space debris. The U.S. is the first to impose such a ban. ""Simply put, these tests are dangerous, and we will not conduct them,"" Harris said during remarks at Vandenberg Space Force Base in California. The vice president said the U.S. hopes other nations will follow suit. The U.S. has identified and tracks over 1,600 pieces of debris that Russia created when it used a missile to destroy a satellite in November and more than 2,800 that China generated when it carried out its own test in 2007, Harris said. Russia's direct-ascent anti-satellite missile test created a field of debris that threatened the International Space Station. ""This debris presents a risk to the safety of our astronauts, our satellites and our growing commercial presence,"" she said. ""A piece of space debris the size of a basketball, which travels at thousands of miles per hour, would destroy a satellite. Even a piece of debris as small as a grain of sand could cause serious damage."" ""These weapons are intended to deny the United States our ability to use our space capabilities by destructing, destroying our satellites, satellites which are critical to our national security,"" Harris said. ""These tests, to be sure, are reckless, and they are irresponsible. These tests also put in danger so much of what we do in space."" Ahead of her remarks, the vice president met with members of the United States Space Force and United States Space Command, receiving briefings on their work advancing U.S. national security.",3,,,,9

Here are highlights of what a senior U.S. defense official told reporters Monday on Day 54. Russia 'shaping' the battlefield for renewed offensive There are now 76 Russian battalion tactical groups (BTGs) inside Ukraine, all of them in the south and east. Each BTG is made up of roughly 800-1,000 soldiers. That's up from 65 BTGs last week, so as many 11,000 troops have crossed the border since then, the senior defense official said. Last week, the U.S. mostly saw support forces convoying into the Donbas region, but BTGs are Russia's primary fighting units. Artillery, helicopter support and command and control elements have continued to flow in. In a separate briefing, Pentagon press secretary John Kirby told reporters Monday that while there is currently fighting in Donbas, as there has been for years, defense officials do not believe Russia's new offensive push has begun. ""We believe that the Russians are shaping and setting the conditions for future offensive operations,"" Kirby said. That shaping effort appears to be an attempt by Russia to avoid blunders it made during combat operations in northern Ukraine. ""We believe that they are trying to learn from from past mistakes, and you can see that in just the way they are conducting these shaping operations,"" Kirby said. ""They're conducting themselves in ways that we didn't see around Kyiv, for instance."" While Russian forces are ""trying to set the conditions for more aggressive, more overt, and larger ground maneuvers in the Donbas,"" Kirby said Ukrainian troops are not sitting idle. ""We have seen indications in just the last few days that the Ukrainians not only have have defended bravely, but they have been able to secure certain villages and towns in the Donbas,"" Kirby said. There are another 22 or so BTGs still in Russia north of Ukraine, most likely refitting and resupplying after being depleted form earlier combat in northern Ukraine, according to a defense official. The official noted that if Russia takes Mariupol, it would free up close to another 12 BTGs (roughly 8,800-12,000 troops) that could be used for fighting elsewhere in the south or east. Mariupol Ukrainian forces continue fighting to push back Russian troops in Mariupol, according to the official. The city is still under threat of missile and artillery bombardment. Kyiv and lviv under long-range fire Russian long-range bombers have hit both Kyiv and Lviv with air-launched cruise missiles over the last couple of days, according to the official. ""Our initial assessment is that they were going after primarily military targets, or what they believed to be military targets,"" the official said. During his press briefing, Kirby said the U.S. is still assessing what the Russian's hit in the two cities, but added that most Russian airstrikes are being directed on the east and south of Ukraine, especially Mariupol. The Moskva The U.S. can't verify authenticity of videos purportedly showing Russia's Moskva cruiser sinking, ""but the images themselves comport with what we had assessed to be the damage done to the ship,"" the official said. The official said the U.S. was able to see Russian sailors board lifeboats before the ship sank, but could not confirm how many casualties there might have been. ""It's hard to look at the damage that was done without generally assuming that there were also casualties, that she lost sailors. How many, we just don't know,"" the official said. First shipments of new $800 million US aid package arrive ""Based on the last $800 million that the President authorized that we just announced last week, already there have been four flights from the United States arriving into the theater just yesterday,"" the official said. US to train Ukrainians on artillery In coming days, the U.S. plans to facilitate training for Ukrainians on the howitzers it's sending them, according to the official. The 18 howitzers heading to Ukraine will come from a mix of U.S. Army and Marine Corps stocks. ABC News' Luis Martinez contributed to this report.",14,,,,1
2022-04-18,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/International/takes-prosecute-war-crimes/story?id=83915800,What it takes to prosecute war crimes,"As Russian forces retreated from northern Ukraine, atrocities were revealed and the U.S. and European countries accused Russia of committing war crimes. Last month, the U.S. made a formal legal assessment that Russian forces have committed war crimes in Ukraine. Ukrainian officials Friday said they found more than 900 bodies of civilians in the Kyiv region after Russian forces retreated, 350 of which were found in the town of Bucha. Geoffrey Nice, a barrister who prosecuted former Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic in the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, told ABC News it is obvious that war crimes are being committed in Ukraine. ""Without doubt. It's clear as conveyed from everything we're watching every day on television,"" Nice said. In March, days after the war began, the International Criminal Court announced it is launching an investigation into possible war crimes committed in Ukraine. This story explains what it takes to prosecute war crimes. What is a war crime? War crimes are a part of the law of armed conflict, which governs fighting during war, and apply to all sides of an armed conflict, including armed forces and organized armed groups. These rules are laid out in the Geneva Conventions and their additional protocols. Individuals could also be held responsible or prosecuted for serious violations of the law of armed conflict or a grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions, Tom Dannenbaum, an assistant professor of International Law at Tufts University's Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy, told ABC News in an interview. ""These rules go all the way down the command chain, and indeed all the way up the command chain. ... Any individual from the lowest level physical perpetrator to the highest level commander is potentially implicated, or is at least governed by this law,"" Dannenbaum said. These violations include attacking civilians and their structures, killings, cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment, torture or sexual and gender-based crimes, such as rape, according to Dannenbaum. Jurisdiction and forums for prosecution There are several forums where war crimes can be prosecuted. In Ukraine, this includes the ICC, domestic courts and courts in countries that have universal jurisdiction. Ukraine has consented to the jurisdiction of the ICC, which can prosecute four main crimes: genocide; crimes against humanity, including murder, rape, imprisonment, deportation and torture; war crimes that breach the Geneva conventions; and the crime of aggression. In order for individuals to stand trial in the ICC, they must voluntarily consent to it or be handed over to the court. Russia does not recognize the jurisdiction of the ICC and is not required to hand over suspects who are indicted. Domestic courts in Ukraine can prosecute war crimes since the crimes occurred within their territorial jurisdiction, and Russian courts can prosecute crimes involving their citizens, based on nationality jurisdiction. Universal jurisdiction exists in some countries, including Australia, France and Germany, allowing them to prosecute individuals for crimes committed out of their territory. The individuals do not need to be citizens of the prosecuting country nor does the crime have to have been committed against its citizens. ""It asserts universal jurisdiction on the grounds that this particular crime is a crime that is of universal interest,"" Dannenbaum said. The U.S. does not allow its courts to exercise universal jurisdiction. Evidence gathering and investigating Investigators divide evidence into two categories: crime based and linkage evidence, according to William Wiley, founder and executive director of the Commission for International Justice and Accountability, who has over 20 years experience in International Criminal and Humanitarian Law on the investigative and legal sides. To collect crime based evidence, investigators gather basic facts like such as cause of death, or probable cause of death, time of death, and location of death, Wiley said. ""Crime based, for example, in the well known situation of Bucha, in Ukraine, would be the dead bodies, eye witnesses to the killing of those individuals,"" Wiley said. Crime based evidence makes up a small portion of cases; ""90% of the work in an international criminal investigation, the prosecution is focused on gathering and analysis of linkage evidence,"" Wiley said. Investigators will be looking for ""linkage evidence between those who performed the wrongful act on the ground and any other actors that are potentially going to be subject to investigation and prosecution, particularly those up the chain of command,"" Dannenbaum said. Linkage evidence can include documents, documentary materials generated, communications, satellite imagery or insider witnesses. Investigators are looking for evidence that could establish intent. Finding sufficient linkage evidence is the main challenge prosecutors and investigators face, Wiley said. ""What it takes to prosecute a war crime is a great deal of evidence because ultimately, war crimes cases are are brought against higher level perpetrators who need a great deal of linkage material and connect somebody in Moscow to offenses perpetrated in, for instance, Bucha,"" Wiley said. But Ukraine appears to be gathering communications evidence ""in considerable volumes ... because the Russian operational security appears to be extremely poor. They're not using frequently encrypted communications devices, certainly on the tactical and operational level,"" Wiley said. Nice disagreed, and said there doesn't need to be a huge amount of evidence. The war ""was associated with war crimes right from the very beginning. Never been any doubt about that,"" said Nice. He added, ""There doesn't necessarily need to be a huge amount of evidence because it is so overwhelmingly clear."" Suspects are identified late in the investigative process. Investigators start by gathering evidence surrounding the perpetrating structures, then they link those crimes to a crime base, and finally they work toward identifying suspects, Wiley said. ""Ultimately, it's not Russia that is going to be put on trial ... it's individual suspects,"" Wiley said. The legal principle of command responsibility states that commanders are responsible for the conduct their subordinates, Wiley said. This runs all the way up the command chain, including Russian President Vladimir Putin. This rules out the possibility of higher ranking officials claiming they were unaware of the actions committed by their forces. ""For instance, in Bucha, this is not going to be an effective defense because the law of command responsibility imposes a requirement on commanders to be aware, at all times, of what their men are up to,"" Wiley said. Could Russian forces and leadership face prosecution? Experts agree that it is unlikely the highest-ranking officials will be prosecuted, but Russian forces could be. There is a ""fairly strong prospect"" for Russian forces to be sent to trial because a number of them have been captured by Ukraine and because there is ""an unprecedented level of international cooperation around gathering evidence, making sure it's preserved,"" Dannenbaum said. Dannenbaum said countries are providing the ICC with additional resources, including financial support and investigative teams. Wiley also thinks forces will be prosecuted. ""I don't think there's going to be a problem getting some Russian perpetrators into court. The fundamental question is, what ranks will they hold, or will they have held,"" Wiley said. ""However, there's a great many Russian soldiers, and paramilitary personnel connected to the Russian security intelligence services, who've been captured by the Ukrainians,"" Wiley said. But the likelihood of Putin or other high-ranking Russian officials being prosecuted is not high. ""It's much less likely that those individuals will come into the custody of the jurisdictions that would seek to prosecute them. And Putin himself has an additional wrinkle, which is a concept called head of state immunity, which makes it difficult to prosecute Putin in domestic courts,"" Dannenbaum. But he could be prosecuted in the ICC. If there is regime change in Russia, he could be tried, Nice said. ""If there's a regime change in Russia, as there was in Serbia, which led to the former Serbian President being handed over, then he may be tried,"" Nice said.",13,,,,7
2022-04-13,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/International/tens-thousands-feared-dead-mariupol-russia-renews-assault/story?id=84032405,Tens of thousands feared dead in Mariupol as Russia renews assault in eastern Ukraine,"LONDON -- Tens of thousands of civilians could be dead in Mariupol, the city's mayor said, as analysts warn that Russia is regrouping for a renewed assault on eastern Ukraine. The streets in Mariupol are “carpeted” with bodies, Vadym Boychenko, the mayor of Mariupol, said Monday. While there is no confirmed number of casualties, the mayor suggested the number of dead could be well over 10,000 in the coastal town, the site of some of the worst bombardment since the Russian invasion of Ukraine began. ""If it is possible to mention such a terrifying number, then it is above 10,000. According to our estimates, it is 20,000 plus, unfortunately,” Boychenko said in an interview with the Associated Press. Russian airstrikes have battered the southeastern city over the past few weeks targeting all kinds of buildings, including a theatre housing those seeking refuge, a maternity hospital and an art school. Officials say that over 80 percent of the city is destroyed. With the city almost completely cut off from the outside world, it has been difficult for the authorities to verify atrocities alleged to have been committed on the ground, including claims made Monday by the Azov battalion, a far-right group now part of the Ukrainian National Guard, that Russia may have used chemical weapons against the Ukrainian forces in the city. The claims could not be independently verified by ABC News. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's office and the country's ministry of defense said they are investigating the claims. “We are currently confirming this information, trying to understand what it was. According to preliminary information, we can say that it is possible– that it was, rather, a phosphorous munition. Official information will be finalized later,"" Hanna Maliar, Deputy Minister of Defence, said during a national news broadcast. A spokesman for Russian-backed separatists, Eduard Basurin, was quoted by the Interfax news agency as saying Tuesday that they ""haven't used any chemical weapons in Mariupol."" But on the eve of the alleged attack, Basurin made the case on Russian TV that his forces should use chemical weapons against Ukrainian troops to ""smoke them out."" Late on Monday, Pentagon spokesman John Kirby issued a statement saying that the use of a substance cannot be confirmed, but expressed concerns about Russia’s potential use of “riot control agents including tear gas mixed with chemical agents.” “We are aware of social media reports which claim Russian forces deployed a potential chemical munition in Mariupol, Ukraine. We cannot confirm at this time and will continue to monitor the situation closely. These reports, if true, are deeply concerning and reflective of concerns that we have had about Russia’s potential to use a variety of riot control agents, including tear gas mixed with chemical agents, in Ukraine,” the statement reads. Britain's armed forces minister said on Tuesday that should Russia resort to the use of chemical weapons in the eastern Ukrainian city of Mariupol, ""all possible options are on the table in terms of how the West might respond” in response to the speculation, saying the reports had not been verified. Whether or not phosphorous is considered a chemical weapon is a topic of debate among militaries and governments. Although phosphorus is not classified as a chemical weapon under the Chemical Weapons Convention, the Geneva Convention forbids its use as an incendiary weapon in civilian areas. Amidst the reports of Russia regrouping behind its own borders, the British Ministry of Defense warned today that the fighting is set to intensify over the next two-three weeks with a renewed assault. “Fighting in eastern Ukraine will intensify over the next two to three weeks as Russia continues to refocus its efforts there,” the U.K.'s ministry of defense stated in a tweet. “Russian attacks remain focused on Ukrainian positions near Donetsk and Luhansk with further fighting around Kherson and Mykolaiv and a renewed push towards Kramatorsk. Russian forces continue to withdraw from Belarus in order to redeploy in support of operations in eastern Ukraine,"" the post added.",17,,,,12
2022-04-13,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/International/inside-ukrainian-village-farmers-stay-harvest-fear-russian/story?id=84016336,Inside a Ukrainian village where farmers stay for the harvest but fear Russian attack,"The wheat has been sown for the coming season, but nobody in Yakovlivka, a small farming village outside Kharkiv in northeastern Ukraine, knows if it will be harvested. A week after Russian forces launched their invasion on Feb. 24, the village was bombed. The head of the village administration said four people were killed and 11, including children, were wounded in the attack. ""We were sitting in our cellar for four hours and read the Lord's Prayer. We wrapped the kids into blankets and just couldn't fall asleep until 3 or 4 in the morning,"" said Nina Bonderenko, who works on her cousin's farm. Villagers said the attack may have been aimed at a unit of Ukrainian soldiers camping temporarily in the village school, though apart from some broken windows, the building was undamaged by the blasts. Reuters was not able to independently verify the villagers' account of the bombing. Russia has denied targeting civilians in what it calls a ""special operation"" to demilitarize and ""denazify"" its neighbor. Ukraine and its allies dismiss that as a baseless pretext for war. Since the village was bombed, residents say all certainty has been lost. ""We have planted all the wheat. But will we be able to grow anything and harvest it under the current circumstances?"" said Vadim Aleksandrovich, the director of Granary of Sloboda, a farming company that emerged from a former Soviet-era collective farm. ""Only God knows. We are doing our best."" With the country at war, the uncertainty facing Yakovlivka is shared across the country by farmers who produce the grain that has historically made Ukraine, the world's fifth biggest wheat exporter, one of the great breadbaskets of the world. Last season, Granary of Sloboda's harvest amounted to 3,000 tons of wheat, 3,000 tons of sunflower and 1,000 tons of corn. But at the moment, 80% of the firm's 17,300 acres are not accessible because of mines or combat operations, Aleksandrovich said. Only the fields immediately around Yakovlivka village can be reached relatively safely, and there is heavy fighting around the firm's seed storage facility at its base in Izyum, some 87 miles away, he said. Before farm workers can go out to the fields, they call emergency services to find out if the area is safe. When rockets land in the fields, explosives disposal services remove any projectiles. ""The situation is very tense, and it is unclear what will happen to us,"" Aleksandrovich said. ""We don't even know what will happen in one hour."" Despite the uncertainty, most of the villagers have remained, refusing to join a national exodus that has seen around a quarter of the country's population of 44 million flee their homes. Of 533 permanent residents before the war, 380 have stayed, with refugees from outside boosting the population to 436, according to local authorities. Although the village shop has closed, people have started to patch up the damaged houses that can still be repaired. ""I thought I could live my last days in peace and then this,"" said 66 year-old Vera Babenko, picking a bowl out from under a pile of rubble by her now door-less refrigerator. She said a bomb landed just beside her house, about 650 feet from the school the attack was apparently supposed to hit, but she said she had no plans to leave. ""I want to rebuild my kitchen.""",17,,,,16
2022-04-12,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/International/humanitarian-corridors-work-offer-lifeline-besieged-ukrainians/story?id=84011869,How humanitarian corridors work to offer lifeline to besieged Ukrainians,"For tens of thousands of civilians trapped in active combat zones in Ukraine, the establishment of humanitarian corridors could mean the difference between living and dying, experts said. At least nine humanitarian corridors are expected to open in war-torn areas of eastern Ukraine this week to allow civilians to escape heavy fighting, Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said. More than 4,354 people used the opened humanitarian corridors on Monday to evacuate via buses and private cars, according to Vereshchuk. She said the same safe passages will be open on Tuesday. But the designated routes out of besieged towns such as Mariupol in southeast Ukraine and areas of the Donbas in eastern Ukraine can be dangerous if not done with precision and complete transparency, Crystal Wells, a spokesperson for the International Committee of the Red Cross, told ABC News. “We see humanitarian corridors, that we refer to as safe passages, as really a desperate measure in dire times,"" Wells said. Humanitarian corridors are routes for civilians to escape from the most dangerous war zones. The safe passages require Russian and Ukrainian leaders to agree on specific routes and a ceasefire span of time along those thoroughfares to allow civilians a window of opportunity to get out of the crossfire. Safe passageways during wars date back to World War II, when routes were established to transport 10,000 children from Nazi-controlled countries in humanitarian rescues dubbed ""kindertransports."" The Geneva Conventions in 1949 also established rules to ensure civilians had access to humanitarian supplies, including food and medicine, during war. ""It’s important, first of all, to remember that civilians are actually protected under international humanitarian law. Those are the laws that govern armed conflict,"" Wells said. ""And civilians should be protected from hostilities whether they’re in their homes, in a hospital, in a school or in a so-called humanitarian corridor."" But Wells said that some humanitarian routes opened in Ukraine had to quickly be closed or not used at all because hostilities resumed. ""It’s not like all of a sudden a humanitarian corridors comes in and it's a magic wand to ending civilian suffering,"" Wells said. “It's so important that these are agreed on not just in principle but in concrete terms so that it’s not only the people sitting in capital cities who agree. It needs to come down to actionable, concrete, logistical details, and it has to be communicated down the chain of command to the militaries on the ground for these to work safely."" She said if details of a humanitarian corridor, including the precise routes and ceasefire times, are not conveyed to frontline troops, it could create a dangerous -- and deadly -- situation. “It's not just about the safety of our teams, but it's to not also lead people or accompany people into something where they could be in harm's way,"" Wells said. In the absence of humanitarian corridors, Ukrainian civilians have risked their lives trying to flee battle zones on their own. Many have been killed. “What's been happening in cities like Mariupol is that in the absence of these concrete agreements, you have civilians leaving, but they’re doing so in a very ad hoc way. They’re making a life-and-death decision to go, and there’s not a ceasefire agreement in place and there’s not specifics about routes and the times and all of that. So, it’s very risky for people."" Much of the focus for humanitarian agencies in recent days has been on Mariupol, a port city of nearly 400,000 people that has been under siege since the start of the Russian invasion on Feb. 24. Mariupol Mayor Vadym Boychenko told the Associated Press by telephone Monday that the death toll in his city has surpassed 10,000 and could reach double that as attacks continue. Boychenko also alleged Russian forces have brought mobile crematoriums to Mariupol to collect and incinerate civilian bodies in an attempt to cover up evidence of war crimes. Russia has denied committing atrocities in Ukraine and claims it is not targeting civilians. Vereshchuk said in a statement posted on social media Monday that humanitarian evacuation routes were agreed upon for those traveling by private cars from Mariupol. Wells estimated that more than 100,000 civilians remain in Mariupol. ""For us, Mariupol really remains very much a focus and a priority,"" Wells said. ""That’s a city that’s been for weeks now without any humanitarian aid. They’ve been for weeks now without really any proper safe passage for civilians out of the city."" She said ICRC teams have been trying for weeks to deliver humanitarian aid to Mariupol without success. ""We tried again a couple of Fridays ago to access Mariupol, and our teams spent five days and five nights on the road trying to get into the city, and security conditions didn’t allow it,"" Wells said. Wells said the ICRC has successfully used designated safe passages to get civilians out of the hard-hit town of Sumy in northeast Ukraine and between the Russian-controlled city Berdyansk to safety in Zaporizhzhia, a roughly 120-mile journey. She said an unarmed ICRC convoy from Berdyansk to Zaporizhzhia last week included buses and Red Cross land cruisers clearly marked with the agency's emblem at the front and rear of the caravan. Wells said many of the civilians who joined the convoy were fleeing Mariupol. ""We had seven buses with seven volunteer bus drivers, and that would allow about 350 people to board,"" Wells said. ""But then we had private cars starting to join the convoy from Berdyansk all the way to Zaporizhzhia. By the end of that convoy to Zaporizhzhia, they estimated there were about 100 civilian cars, which got us up to about 1,000 people."" Wells said the evacuation from Berdyansk to Zaporizhzhia took two days. She said a similar mission in Mariupol would likely take longer. ""To think of doing it for 100,000 people, we would really need agreements to hold for not just hours, but days,"" Wells said. No matter how much time is granted to the humanitarian corridors, Wells said some civilians are bound to get left behind. ""What about the elderly? What about people with disabilities? Not everyone is able-bodied to get into their own car or board a bus and leave,"" Wells said. ""So, that’s where it’s also important that aid needs to be brought into these places as well and that civilians still have to be protected and respected from hostilities.""",17,,,,17
2022-04-11,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/russian-commander-depravity-brutality-pentagon-update-day-47/story?id=84018303,"New Russian commander, same 'depravity and brutality': Pentagon update Day 47","The Pentagon has been providing daily updates on the U.S. assessment of the Russian invasion of Ukraine and Ukraine's efforts to resist. Here are highlights of what a senior U.S. defense official told reporters Monday on Day 47: Russia's new invasion commander The U.S. assesses that Putin has appointed Gen. Alexander Dvornikov to lead the invasion effort. But the change in leadership can't erase the logistical and operational problems that have plagued Russian forces, according to the senior U.S. defense official. ""They have high challenges to surmount, and the choice of a general doesn't mean that they're poised for greater success,"" the official said. Dvornikov previously led Russian forces in the south of Ukraine. ""He was the commander of the southern military district. And in the early days and weeks of the conflict, the Russians did achieve more success in the south than they achieved certainly in the north. I have no idea that was a factor in his selection,"" the official said. The official noted that Russian efforts in the south are now largely stalled, with no progress against Mariupol since last week, and no success advancing on Mykolayiv. ""If Mr. Putin's decision to pick Dvornikov was because he had some success, it wasn't that much,"" the official said. New commander, same 'depravity and brutality' The official said it is unclear how Dvornikov's selection could affect the fighting, but said a pattern of brutality remains a constant. ""What is clear is that the Russians continue to sink to new lows of depravity and brutality, as we saw with the missile strike on the train station last week,"" the official said. The death and destruction in Mariupol is also a concern. ""We're all bracing for when the rest of the world gets to see what happens in Mariupol, what has happened. I think we're certainly bracing ourselves here for some for some potentially really, really horrible outcomes,"" the official said. Russians moving troops and supplies toward Donbas Some of the Russian units that withdrew from the northern Ukraine area are starting to move east toward the Russian cities of Belgorod and Valuyki. A long convoy of Russian vehicles is beginning to head south to Donbas from that area. ""We believe that this line of vehicles that we talked about that are north of Izium came out of the Belgorod/Valuyki region, from there to the south,"" the official said. Last week, the official said the Pentagon assessed Russia would use that region to refit and resupply its battalion tactical groups (BTGs) that have been worn down by hard fighting near Kyiv and other areas of Ukraine. Some Russian units are too gutted to fight. ""At least in the grouping that we're aware of, it's not an insignificant number of their BTGs are combat ineffective. And what does that mean? It means a lot of things. It can mean that they don't have the manpower that they need to effectively conduct a mission, or it could be ammunition and supply. It could be vehicles, depending on what the BTG does -- not all of them are just infantry,"" the official said. The Pentagon believes the convoy is still north of Izyim and is an effort to reenforce and resupply their forces in Donbas with command and control elements, armored vehicles, and possibly helicopter and infantry support. Artillery is also a part of the reinforcement effort. ""We've seen evidence that the Russians are beginning to reinforce some of their positions southwest of Donetsk. They're doing that largely with artillery units,"" the official said. Military aid flowing to Ukraine by air and land Eight to 10 flights per day are bringing military supplies into the region, and ""near constant convoys on the ground"" are flowing materiel into Ukraine, the official said. U.S. intelligence assisting Ukraine In addition to providing support in the form of missiles, drones and small arms, the U.S. is also giving intel to assist Ukraine in the fight. ""We are providing good intelligence to the Ukrainians to help them with their self-defense,"" the official said. No evidence Russia took out Slovakian S-300 system in Ukraine While the Pentagon assesses Russia damaged airport infrastructure with an airstrike Sunday, there is no indication that any S-300 surface-to-air systems were destroyed, as Russia has claimed. ""We have no evidence to conclude that they destroyed an S-300 system and we have no evidence to conclude that it was in fact the Slovakian one,"" the official said. Slovakia recently gave its sole S-300 battery to Ukraine. US considering training more Ukrainians on new weapons A small group of Ukrainian troops in the U.S. for planned military training in the U.S. when Russia invaded their country just returned home Sunday. The Pentagon took advantage of their presence to train them on the explosive Switchblade drones the U.S. is sending to aid Ukraine. The official on Monday said the U.S. is looking into training more Ukrainians, possibly in the States. ""It kind of follows that the Ukrainians are busy right now and that they obviously will want as many hands on deck there ... to fight this war. But there's been no policy decision that I'm aware of that would prevent them from coming to the United States,"" the official said. But the Pentagon is considering several possibilities. ""As for additional training on systems like the Switchblade, we are reviewing and thinking about and considering a number of different options for how we could manage to get more Ukrainians trained on that system,"" the official said. ""It's a small number of systems as you know, but it's a new system that they're not familiar with.""",14,,,,1

But he said Ukrainian troops are ready. ""Russian troops will move to even larger operations in the east of our state. They can use even more missiles against us, even more air bombs,"" Zelenskyy said in a televised address late Sunday. ""But we are preparing for their actions. We will respond. We will be even more active in providing Ukraine with weapons. We will be more active in the international arena. We will be even more active in the information field."" After Russian forces invaded Ukraine from the north, east and south on Feb. 24, they quickly reached the outskirts of Kyiv, but ultimately failed to seize the Ukrainian capital and other major cities in the north. Russian forces were met with strong resistance from Ukrainian troops, despite weeks of relentless bombardment that decimated entire neighborhoods and claimed civilian lives. The Russian military announced on March 29 it would scale down activities in the north around Kyiv and Chernihiv and instead focus its efforts on the ""liberation"" of the contested Donbas region in the east, which is home to a mostly Russian-speaking population. Russia-backed separatist forces have controlled two breakaway republics of eastern Ukraine's Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts in Donbas since 2014, following Russia's annexation of Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula. The Russian troops that have retreated from northern and northeastern Ukraine in recent days are now resting and resupplying in neighboring Belarus and Russia, according to observers, who noted it could take weeks before those troops are redployed for a fresh attack in the east. ""At least some of these forces will be transferred to East Ukraine to fight in the Donbas,"" the U.K. Ministry of Defense said in an intelligence update on April 8. ""Many of these forces will require significant replenishment before being ready to deploy further east with any mass redeployment from the north likely to take at least a week minimum."" Nevertheless, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg warned that ""this is a crucial phase of the war."" ""In the coming weeks, we expect a further Russian push in eastern and southern Ukraine to try to take the entire Donbas and to create a land bridge to occupied Crimea,"" Stoltenberg said at a press conference on April 5. Satellite images collected on April 8 by Maxar Technologies show a large military convoy of hundreds of vehicles, including tanks, that extends for at least 8 miles, moving south through the eastern Ukrainian town of Velykyi Burluk, about 55 miles east of Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, and some 65 miles from the border with Russia. Ukrainian authorities have warned citizens in the east that this is their last chance to flee, as Russian forces are expected to push south from Kharkiv and north from Donetsk in an attempt to encircle the battle-hardened Ukrainain troops in Donbas. In an interview with The Associated Press published Saturday, Zelenskyy said his country holds a strong position in the east and at the negotiation table because it maintains control of the southeastern port city of Mariupol, which has been under Russian bombardment for more than a month. Although Russian forces have failed to capture the strategic port to secure a coastal corridor to Crimea, artillery and air raids have largely reduced Mariupol to rubble and killed thousands of residents, according to local officials. ""Mariupol is the heart of this war today,"" Zelenskyy told the AP. ""The stronger our position in Mariupol, the stronger our position in the east of the country."" In his address on Sunday night, Zelenskyy said this coming ""week will be no less important than"" the previous ones. ""It will be just as tense and even more responsible. Russia will be even more afraid. Afraid to lose,"" he said. ""I will continue to address the parliaments and nations of the world. We will meet our partners, leaders of other states in Kyiv and other Ukrainian cities. We will attract even more funds and resources to help Ukraine.",14,,,,12

Here are highlights of what a senior U.S. defense official told reporters Friday on Day 44: U.S. sending Patriot system to backfill Slovakia After repeated pleas from Ukraine for help defending itself against Russian air strikes, Slovakia is sending its sole S-300 surface-to-air missile system to Ukraine, it announced Friday, and at the same time, the U.S. announced it is moving one of its Patriot missile batteries to Slovakia to replace it. ""At my direction, and at the invitation of Slovakia, U.S. European Command will reposition one Patriot missile system, manned by U.S. service members, to Slovakia,"" Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said in a statement Friday. ""Their deployment length has not yet been fixed, as we continue to consult with the Slovakian government about more permanent air defense solutions."" There has been talk of such an arrangement since last month when Slovakian defense minister Jaroslav Nad’ said his country was ready to deliver its Soviet-era S-300 to Ukraine on condition Slovakia's air-defense capability be immediately backfilled. ""Should there be situation that we have a proper replacement or that we have a capability guaranteed for a certain period of time, then we will be willing to discuss the future of S-300 system,"" Slovakia's Prime Minister Eduard Heger said in a joint press conference with Austin on March 17. A U.S. military Patriot battery based in Germany was pre-positioned in Poland for this purpose, and that system will soon be moving to from Poland to Slovakia to replace its S-300, according to a senior U.S. defense official. The Slovak military has previously said it had about 45 missiles for its S-300 system. US 'not buying' Russia's denial of hitting railway station The Pentagon is ""not buying"" Russia's denial of responsibility, a senior U.S. defense official said. ""They originally claimed a successful strike and then only retracted it when there were reports of civilian casualties,"" the official said. ""It's our full expectation that this was a Russian strike -- we believe they used a short range ballistic missile, an SS-21."" Why might the Russians have targeted it? The official said the station is a major rail hub in a ""very strategic location,"" just south of the key city of Izyum. ""And we've been talking now for days and days about how Izyum was so important to them because it lies almost in the middle of the Donbas,"" the official said. Russian units 'eradicated' Some of the Russian battalion tactical groups (BTGs) that have withdrawn back across the Belarusian and Russian borders have been essentially gutted from hard fighting in Ukraine, according to the senior defense official. ""We've seen indications of some units that are literally, for all intents and purposes, eradicated. There's just nothing left of the BTG except a handful of troops and maybe a small number of vehicles,"" the official said. In terms of total losses -- counting troops, tanks, aircraft and missile inventory – Russia has lost between 15-20% of the combat power it originally had arrayed against Ukraine since the beginning of the invasion, according to the official. Russia hoping to recruit 60,000 new troops Some of the Russian forces withdrawn from around Kyiv and elsewhere are now heading to the Russian cities of Belgorod and Valuyki, to the northwest of Donbas. But there are ""no indications"" that fresh troops are waiting there to join them. For now, degraded Russian BTGs, usually made up of roughly 800-1,000 troops, are ""exploring the option of"" consolidating, banding together remaining forces and supplies to form new units. ""It's really going to depend on the unit and how ready they are to get back into the fight, but we don't believe that in general this is going to be a speedy process for them given the kinds of casualties they've taken and the kind of damage that they've sustained to their to their units' readiness,"" the official said. Russia is also aiming to recruit upwards of 60,000 new troops, according to the official. ""They hope to get reinforced by new conscripts -- there's a whole new conscription schedule coming up here in May,"" the official said, adding that Russian conscripts serve for one year. ""It remains to be seen how successful they'll be on this, and where those reinforcements would go, how much training they would get,"" the official said. Additionally, the U.S. sees indications Russia has begun mobilizing reservists. After Russian BTGs rebuild, ""the most likely course of action would be for them to move immediately south right into the Donbas,"" the official said. The Pentagon estimates more than 40 Russian BTGs are already positioned in or near the Donbas region. The estimate was ""more than 30"" on Wednesday, meaning up to 10,000 more troops have arrived in recent days. ABC News' Luis Martinez contributed to this report.",14,,,,1
2022-04-08,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/International/50-killed-attack-ukrainian-train-station/story?id=83960097,At least 50 killed in attack on Ukrainian train station,"At least 50 people, including five children, were killed in a rocket attack on a train station in eastern Ukraine on Friday, authorities said. Two Russian rockets struck the station in Kramatorsk in Donetsk Oblast on Friday morning, according to Ukraine's state-owned railway company, which in a statement via Facebook called the attack ""a purposeful strike on the passenger infrastructure of the railway and the residents of the city of Kramatorsk."" Donetsk Oblast Gov. Pavlo Kyrylenko said 38 of the 50 people killed died at the scene while 12 died in hospitals. At least 100 people were injured, according to the governor. Graphic images provided by Ukrainian officials showed the aftermath of the attack -- bodies lying on the ground next to scattered luggage and debris, with charred vehicles parked nearby. The remains of a large rocket with the words ""for our children"" in Russian painted on the side was also seen on the ground next to the main building of the station. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in a statement via Facebook that a Tochka-U short-range ballistic missile was used in Friday's attack. Russia has denied involvement in the attack. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov claimed involvement of Russian forces was already ruled out by the Russian Ministry of Defense, based on the type of missile that was used -- a Tochka-U short-range ballistic missile. ""Our Armed Forces do not use missiles of this type,"" Peskov told reporters during a press briefing Friday. ""No combat tasks were set or planned for today in Kramatorsk."" According to a senior U.S. defense official, the initial assessment by the U.S. is this was a short-range ballistic missile fired by Russian forces from inside Ukraine. The attack occurred as ""thousands"" of civilians fleeing the Russian invasion were at the train station waiting to be taken to ""safer regions of Ukraine,"" according to Kyrylenko, who accused Russian forces of ""deliberately trying to disrupt the evacuation of civilians."" ""The evacuation will continue,"" the governor added. ""Anyone who wants to leave the region will be able to do so."" Nate Mook, CEO of Chef José Andrés' World Central Kitchen, told CNN he was near the train station picking up supplies when the station was hit. He said he saw thousands of women, children and elderly waiting for a train, and less than two minutes later, he heard five to 10 booms. Mook tweeted, ""Innocent women & children were murdered here today."" White House press secretary Jen Psaki called the attack ""yet another horrific atrocity"" but stopped short of calling it a war crime without further investigation. ""Obviously the targeting of civilians would certainly be a war crime and we've already called a range of the actions we have seen to date a war crime, but we're going to be supporting efforts to investigate exactly what happened here,"" she said. Psaki also said that although the sanctions package announced Wednesday was ""augmented as a result of the atrocities"" seen in Bucha, the administration would assess how this new attack would impact additional sanctions. ""What we have done to date and will continue to do is look at, unfortunately, the continued atrocities that we're seeing in the country and assess how that's going to impact sanctions, consequences, and obviously additional security assistance,"" she said. ""And I'm certain given the video footage we have seen and on air waves across the world, and photos, that this will be a part of the discussion that our national security officials are having with their counterparts moving forward."" Earlier this week, large crowds of people were seen waiting on the platform to board trains at the Kramatorsk railway station as they fled the city in eastern Ukraine's disputed Donbas region. Since 2014, Russia-backed separatist forces have controlled two breakaway republics of the Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts in the Donbas. The separatists have been fighting alongside Russian troops to seize more territory there, after Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24. Now, the Russian military is said to be refocusing its offensive in the Donbas as its troops withdraw from northern Ukraine.

2022-04-07,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/International/amnesty-international-russian-forces-executed-civilians-ukraine/story?id=83927829,"Russian forces executed civilians in Ukraine, Amnesty International says","Russian forces have executed civilians in Ukraine in apparent war crimes, Amnesty International said Thursday. The London-based international human rights group published new testimony after conducting on-the-ground research in areas around Ukraine's capital amid Russia's invasion. Its report adds to a growing body of evidence that Russian troops have committed war crimes amid Russian President Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine -- a charge that U.S. and Ukrainian officials have repeatedly made, but that the Kremlin vehemently denies. Amnesty International said its crisis response investigators interviewed more than 20 people from villages and towns near Kyiv, many of whom claimed to have witnessed or have had direct knowledge of Russian soldiers committing horrific acts of violence against unarmed civilians across the region. ""In recent weeks, we have gathered evidence that Russian forces have committed extrajudicial executions and other unlawful killings, which must be investigated as likely war crimes,"" Amnesty International Secretary-General Agnes Callamard said in a statement Thursday. ""Testimonies show that unarmed civilians in Ukraine are being killed in their homes and streets in acts of unspeakable cruelty and shocking brutality."" The organization noted that deliberate killings of civilians, rape and torture, as well as inhumane treatment of prisoners of war, are human rights violations and war crimes, and that those who commit them should be held criminally responsible along with any superiors who knew or had reason to know about such atrocities but did not attempt to stop or punish the perpetrators. The International Criminal Court, a United Nations Human Rights Council commission of inquiry and Ukraine's prosecutor general have all opened investigations into possible war crimes by Russian forces. But the interviews conducted by Amnesty International and published Thursday provide a harrowing window into these kinds of attacks with grisly detail. According to the report, one of the interviewees -- 18-year-old Kateryna Tkachova -- told Amnesty International that she was at home with her parents in the village of Vorzel, northwest of Kyiv, on March 3 when several tanks painted with the letter ""Z,"" which Russian forces have used to mark their vehicles during the invasion of Ukraine, rolled down their street. Tkachova said her mother and father, who were unarmed and dressed in civilian clothing, left the basement where they were hiding to go into the street, after telling her to stay put. Tkachova said she then heard gunshots. ""Once the tanks had passed by, I jumped over the fence to the neighbor's house. I wanted to check if they're alive,"" Tkachova told Amnesty International. ""I looked over the fence and saw my mother lying on her back on one side of the road, and my father was face down on the other side of the street. I saw large holes in his coat. The next day I went to them. My father had six large holes in his back, my mother had a smaller hole in her chest."" Seven days later, an unnamed volunteer assisting with evacuations from the areas around Kyiv helped Tkachova leave Vorzel. The volunteer told Amnesty International that he had seen the bodies of Tkachova's parents lying in the street near her house, according to the report. Amnesty International said it has also verified video showing the volunteer and Tkachova writing her parents' names, dates of birth and dates of death on a piece of cardboard before placing it beside their bodies, which were covered with blankets. An unnamed 46-year-old woman told Amnesty International that Russian troops entered her village of Bohdanivka, southeast of Kyiv, on March 7 or 8. On the night of March 9, the woman said she heard gunshots through the downstairs windows of her home, where she lived with her husband, 10-year-old daughter and 81-year-old mother-in-law. She told Amnesty International that she and her husband shouted that they were civilians and that they were unarmed. When they came downstairs, two Russian soldiers pushed them and their daughter into the boiler room. ""They forced us in and slammed the door,"" she told Amnesty International. ""After just a minute they opened the door, they asked my husband if he had cigarettes. He said no, he hadn't smoked for a couple of weeks. They shot him in his right arm. The other said, 'Finish him,' and they shot him in the head."" ""He didn't die right away. From 9.30 p.m. to 4 a.m. he was still breathing, though he wasn't conscious,"" she added, according to Amnesty International. ""Blood was flowing out of him. When he took his last breath, I turned to my daughter and said, 'It seems daddy has died.'"" A neighbor told Amnesty International that they witnessed Russian soldiers breaking into the woman's house that night and also confirmed seeing her husband's body slumped in the corner of the boiler room. The woman and her child escaped from Bohdanivka later that day. The woman's mother-in-law, who has limited mobility, was left behind, according to Amnesty International. Another woman, from an unidentified village east of Kyiv, told Amnesty International that two Russian soldiers entered her house on March 9, killed her husband and then repeatedly raped her at gunpoint while her young son hid nearby in the boiler room, according to the report. The unnamed woman managed to escape from the village with her son and they fled to Ukrainian-controlled territory. ""The intentional killing of civilians is a human rights violation and a war crime,"" Callamard said. ""These deaths must be thoroughly investigated, and those responsible must be prosecuted, including up the chain of command."" Interviewees also told Amnesty International they had lost access to electricity, water and gas in the early days of the Russian invasion and that there was very limited access to food. There was poor cellphone service in the region, and some interviewees said Russian soldiers had confiscated or destroyed mobile phones whenever they saw residents carrying them, or threatened them with violence for having one. Amnesty International found that threats of violence and intimidation were also widespread. One man in Hostomel, a town northwest of Kyiv, reported seeing an entire dormitory of people who were sheltering from shelling and were forced to go outside, where Russian military officers immediately fired gunshots over their heads, forcing them to drop to the ground. Two men from Bucha, another town northwest of Kyiv, also said snipers regularly shot at them when they went to salvage food from a destroyed grocery store near their home, according to Amnesty International. Russian forces invaded neighboring Ukraine on Feb. 24, seizing territory and shelling entire cities. But they have faced strong resistance from Ukrainian troops, who have retaken some territory in recent days as Russian forces retreated. According to Ukrainian Prosecutor General Iryna Venedyktova, at least 410 civilians have been found dead in recently recaptured towns near Kyiv, particularly in Bucha, which has galvanized global outrage, while graphic evidence of the atrocities has emerged, including eyewitness testimony along with videos and images, Russia has claimed the scenes were ""staged."" Amnesty International said it has obtained evidence that civilians were also killed in indiscriminate attacks in Kharkiv and Sumy Oblasts, documented an airstrike that killed civilians queueing for food in the northern city of Chernihiv, and gathered evidence from civilians living under siege in the battered cities of Kharkiv, Izium and Mariupol. ""As these horrendous accounts of life under Russian occupation continue to emerge,"" Callamard said, ""the victims in Ukraine must know that the international community is determined to secure accountability for their suffering.""",13,,,,17
2022-04-07,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/International/genocide-legal-threshold-crossed-ukraine/story?id=83883901,What is genocide and has the legal threshold been crossed in Ukraine?,"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy accused Russia of committing genocide after he said hundreds of civilians were found dead in the town of Bucha following the Russian military's withdrawal. Ukrainian officials have said more than 400 civilians were killed in Bucha, many with hands tied behind their backs, shot at close range. Russia's defense ministry said in a statement Sunday that all photographs and videos published by the Ukrainian authorities alleging ""crimes"" by Russian troops in Bucha were a ""provocation"" and claimed no resident of Bucha suffered violence at the hands of Russian troops. Russia has claimed all its units withdrew completely from Bucha around March 30. An ABC News analysis of videos and satellite imagery confirms some of the bodies seen lying in the streets of Bucha were there as early as March 19, when the town was still occupied by Russian forces, contradicting Russia's claims that the scene was ""staged"" after its troops left. President Joe Biden called Russian President Vladimir Putin a war criminal and the alleged acts committed by Russian troops ""war crimes,"" but fell short of calling it genocide. Experts say this could, in part, be a political decision. ""To say that a genocide is occurring, is also to say, we can't sit on our hands and do nothing here,"" David Simon, a senior lecturer and the director of the Genocide Studies program at Yale University, told ABC News. The U.S. government also has an internal process for designating whether genocide has occurred. It took the State Department five years to designate that a genocide had occurred in Myanmar, Simon said. This story explains the legal term ""genocide"" in relation to the war in Ukraine. What is genocide? Genocide is defined as an act ""committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group,"" according to the United Nations' Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide. Acts of genocide against members of a group listed in the convention include killings; causing them serious bodily or mental harm; deliberately inflicting life conditions calculated to being about its physical destruction; imposing measures to prevent births; or forcibly transferring children of the group to another group. Genocide is not just any large scale violence, or violence that becomes particularly gruesome or grisly, Simon said. There has to be intent by the perpetrators to destroy the group, he said. Killings are also not the only form of genocide that could have occurred in Ukraine, another expert said. ""Other attempts to diminish the group, by placing them in harsh conditions of life, like if you think about starving a group to death, and you actually think of some cities in Ukraine today, where through bombardment and cutting off the flow of humanitarian aid, people are potentially going to be starving,"" Alex Hinton, the director of the Center for the Study of Genocide and Human Rights and UNESCO Chair on Genocide Prevention, told ABC News. Whether or not these violent acts allegedly committed by Russian forces against civilians are found to be acts of genocide, they are illegal under international law and warrant a response from the international community, Simon said. ""What we're seeing in Ukraine almost certainly involves crimes against humanity, war crimes, and then to less well defined terms, ethnic cleansing and mass atrocities,"" Simon said. Legal threshold for defining genocide The legal definition of genocide does not define a threshold for an amount of violence that has to have happened in order for it to be considered genocide. ""The importance of intent within the definition of genocide means really, that there is no legal threshold. Particularly because the convention says the 'intent destroy in whole or in part',"" Simon said. In practice, though, Simon said the possibility of genocide has usually come up when the number of deaths are in the thousands. As of Wednesday, at least 1,480 civilians have been killed and 2,195 others have been injured in Ukraine since Russian forces invaded on Feb. 24, according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. Consequences for genocide The U.N.'s convention on genocide tells countries to take claims to one of the organs of the United Nations for the further prevention and suppression of acts of genocide. However, with Russia's veto power, it is unlikely the Security Council, the organ primarily responsible for ensuring international peace and security, would be able to take action, Simon said. There are a number of things states or geopolitical actors can do, Hinton said. Organizations, including Human Rights Watch, and government actors are currently on the ground gathering evidence for a possible trial of those who may have committed crimes. An inquiry could also be launched to investigate the alleged war crimes committed. The International Criminal Court has begun active investigations into potential war crimes committed, but Simon said it could take years for this to be litigated. ""In most cases, the ICC is able to act only after a conflict is essentially over,"" Simon said. The ICC's investigation into crimes committed in Myanmar is still primarily in the investigation phase, despite the most intense parts of the violence happening in 2017, Simon said. Investigators will need to prove it was Russia's intent to destroy Ukraine or Ukrainians as a group. This evidence would be any articulation of the idea on social media, public broadcasts, in writing or even private communications, Simon said. But, ""there can be no actual case until those individuals that are under warrant are arrested and brought to the Hague for trial,"" Simon said. Radovan Karadzic, who committed war crimes in the former Yugoslavia during 1992 and 1993, and was convicted in the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia in the Hague, was at large until 2008. ""His trial, which included genocide charges, took place something like a decade and a half after the acts he undertook,"" Simon said. Experts say leaders should act either way This violence could push actors to take a stronger stance against Russia, which could have included military action if Russia wasn't a nuclear power, Simon said. Biden has repeatedly said American troops will not join the war in Ukraine, warning that going head-to-head would lead to 'World War III.' Biden has also denied requests from Zelenskyy for a no-fly zone over Ukraine. ""But it may push Europeans to have more of a taste to expand sanctions to include Russian exports of gas and oil, which could be far more devastating to the Russian economy than the sanctions that are in place up to this point,"" Simon said. Hinton agreed that additional sanctions could be imposed, but said lines of diplomacy need to be kept open, Hinton said. ""There has to be a way to get out of the conflict, so diplomacy is absolutely critical,"" Hinton said. Russian and Ukrainian negotiators last held virtual talks on Friday where they discussed the proposed security guarantee treaty. Ukraine proposed a new system of security guarantees similar to NATO's collective defense clause which would legally require ""guarantor countries"" to provide arms and impose a ""no-fly"" zone over Ukraine, in the event of an attack. Simon said the term ""genocide"" can often be used politically, to describe crimes that do not fit its legal definition. ""People tend to use genocide as a label for anything that upsets them. Indeed, the Russians have used Neo-Nazis and genocide against Russians as the pretext for invading in the first place, when there's absolutely no evidence of anything, especially intent to destroy Russians within Ukraine,"" Simon said. Hinton agreed, saying, ""genocide has always from the very beginning, been a sort of political football. It's used and misused by states to serve their interest."" A designation that the crimes committed against Ukrainian civilians amounts to genocide should not make a difference in the response, according to Simon. ""There are clearly violations of international law that are causing great harm to civilian populations. And that alone should should trigger a stronger response,"" he said. ""We have enough evidence of crimes against humanity, that if we think that mass atrocities are a reason for ratcheting up pressure, militarily or otherwise, against the perpetrator force, we have that evidence with us now and we don't need to have a determination of genocide to decide whether or not we find bodies in the street of Bucha repulsive or revolting,"" Simon said.",13,,,,23
2022-04-07,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/International/russia-accused-mobile-crematoriums-incinerate-civilians-mariupol/story?id=83932376,Ukrainian officials accuse Russia of using 'mobile crematoriums' in Mariupol,"In one of the creepiest allegations to emerge from the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the Kremlin is being accused by Ukrainian officials of using ""mobile crematoriums"" to incinerate dead civilians in a deliberate effort to cover-up alleged war crimes in the hard-hit city of Mariupol. Mariupol Mayor Vadym Boychenko made the charge this week, saying he heard eyewitness accounts of Russian soldiers driving around Mariupol with crematoriums on lorries and collecting bodies of civilians while at the same time barring the International Committee of the Red Cross from entering the city with humanitarian aid. ""The world has not seen the scale of the tragedy in Mariupol since the existence of Nazis concentration camps,"" Boychenko said on Tuesday. ""The Russians have turned our entire city into a death camp. Unfortunately, the creepy analogy is getting more and more confirmation."" In a statement released on its Facebook account, the Mariupol City Council said, ""witnesses have seen evidence Russia is operating mobile crematoria in Mariupol, burning the bodies of dead civilians and covering up evidence of war crimes."" The statement added ""this is why Russia is not in a hurry"" to let the ICRC and other human rights watch groups into Mariupol to rescue civilians still trapped there. Boychenko and the city council said the portable human furnaces showed up in Mariupol after reports of alleged atrocities at the hands of Russian troops emerged in Bucha, a suburb of the capital city Kyiv. Ukrainian officials reported that at least 410 civilians were killed in Bucha, including many found with their hands tied behind their backs and shot in the head. Boychenko said his once-thriving port city of 400,000 people has been completely decimated by bombing raids and estimated that around 5,000 people there have been killed. U.S. defense officials told ABC News they have not confirmed the allegations that Russia is using mobile crematoriums to hide evidence of war crimes. Rep. Seth Moulton, D-Massachusetts, told ABC News on Thursday that he is not surprised by the reports. Moulton, a former Marine and a member of the House Armed Services Committee, said that during a 2015 fact-finding mission in Ukraine that he went on with other House members, ""credible sources"" informed him that the Russian Army was using mobile crematoriums on its own soldiers in the Russian occupied Crimea, Ukraine. He said the sources told him Russia was using the devices to cover up the number of its soldiers killed in Crimea. ""We heard this from a variety of sources over there, enough that I was confident in the veracity of the information,"" Moulton said. ""None of that has changed. That is absolutely what was going on back then and I'm now hearing reports, unsurprisingly, that it's happening again."" Moulton said he has no reason to discount reports from Ukrainian officials that Russia is using the incinerators to hide new war crimes. ""The bottom line is this is nothing new for the Russian Army and Vladimir Putin,"" Moulton said. In an interview with Turkish media this week, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy alleged that Russian soldiers were ""cleaning up"" before allowing aid workers into the heavily bombed Mariupol. Pressure has been mounting from the international community to bring war crimes against Putin and other Russian officials. The international criminal court in The Hague has launched an investigation into the atrocities allegedly committed against Ukrainian civilians by Russian troops since the invasion started on Feb. 24. A report released Thursday by Amnesty International claims Russian forces have committed numerous war crimes throughout Ukraine. The organization said its crisis response investigators interviewed more than 20 people from villages and towns near Kyiv and many claimed to have witnessed civilian executions. The United Nations General Assembly on Thursday voted to pass a resolution to suspend Russia from the U.N. Human Rights Council in response to Russian forces' alleged killings of civilians in Ukraine. ""I'm not sure who needs more proof that Russia is committing war crimes,"" Moulton told ABC News. ""They're trying to cover their tracks."" Russia has denied committing atrocities and targeting civilians.",13,,,,17
2022-04-06,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/russia-fully-withdraws-kyiv-region-ukrainians-drone-training/story?id=83914701,"Russia fully withdraws from Kyiv region, Ukrainians get drone training in US: Pentagon update Day 42","The Pentagon has been providing daily updates on the U.S. assessment of the Russian invasion of Ukraine and Ukraine's efforts to resist. Here are highlights of what a senior U.S. defense official told reporters Wednesday on Day 42: All Russian troops withdrawn from around Kyiv and Chernihiv The tens of thousands of Russian troops arrayed against Kyiv and Chernihiv have withdrawn north across the borders of Belarus and Russia to consolidate before likely redeploying to eastern Ukraine, according to the senior defense official. ""We are assessing that they have completely withdrawn from Kiev and from Chernihiv,"" the official said. But even with the Russian forces, the territory remains treacherous. ""There are some indications that they left behind mines and things like that, so the Ukrainians are being somewhat careful in some areas north of Kyiv as they begin to clear the ground and clear the territory and re-occupy it,"" the official said. On Monday, the Pentagon estimated that roughly one-third of the Russian forces apparently originally designated to take the capital remained. Before the withdrawal, there were about 20 Russian battalion tactical groups (BTGs) consisting of 800-1,000 troops each in the areas north and northwest of Kyiv, and another 20 BTGs near Chernihiv, according to the official. While the U.S. hasn't yet seen these troops redeploy elsewhere in Ukraine, it's likely to happen soon, according to the official. ""Our assessment is that they won't want to spend too much time on refit and resupply because they have made a very public show of saying that they're going to prioritize their efforts on the Donbas region,"" the official said. But the timing will depend on how much work is needed to get the Russian forces back into fighting condition. ""Some of these units have been much more depleted than others, and it's possible that the Russians could combine units to make new BTGs as a result, we just we just don't know,"" the official said. Of the roughly 130 BTGs Russia dedicated to the invasion, about 80 are still inside Ukraine, according to the official. More than 30 are already in the Donbas region. US sending 'urgent' shipment of anti-tank missiles for fight in Donbas Ukrainian forces are preparing for a major fight in the east as Russia prepares as many as 40 BTGs to join 30 more battalions already in Donbas. ""They're not waiting,"" the official said. ""They are already adapting to increased Russian activity in the Donbas region and doing the best they can."" On Tuesday, the Biden administration authorized a $100 million drawdown package to ""meet an urgent Ukrainian need for additional Javelin anti-armor systems,"" Pentagon press secretary John Kirby said in a statement. The senior U.S. defense official said this move was specifically to help in Donbas. ""One of the reasons why you saw us describe this $100 million drawdown package last night as an urgent need for Javelins was in fact because of the activity in the Donbas and the Ukrainians wanting to make sure that they're ready for increased Russian activity there,"" the official said. Ukrainians get drone training in US A small number of Ukrainians currently in the U.S. for ""professional military education"" were pulled aside for a couple days of training on Switchblade drones, which the U.S. is sending overseas as part of its military aid, according to the official. ""Although it's not a very difficult system to operate, we took advantage of having them in the country to give them some rudimentary training on that,"" the official said. ""And there may be some additional rudimentary training while they're here."" The official said fewer than 12 Ukrainians were given this U.S.-based training. Pentagon blames Russia for nitric acid explosion The official said the Pentagon is ""monitoring"" an apparent nitric acid explosion in the Luhansk region, which Russia blamed on Ukraine. ""We've seen the Russians claim that this was a Ukrainian attack on this. We do not believe that is true,"" the official said. ""We do believe that the Russians are responsible, but exactly what they used when they did it, why they did it, what the damage is, we just don't have that level of detail,"" the official said. 'Premeditated' Russian atrocities in Bucha ""When you see individuals with their hands tied behind their backs and evidence of being shot in the head, that certainly appears to be premeditated,"" the official said, again calling for Russian war crimes in Ukraine to be investigated. Long-range strikes shifting east Russia has now launched more than 1,450 missiles against Ukraine, according to the official. The Pentagon is seeing more airstrikes targeting the east than Kyiv as Russia shifts its overall focus to the Donbas region.",14,,,,1

Buildings are seen burned and completely destroyed, surrounded by rubble left behind by Russian forces that failed to overtake the Ukrainian capital. Widespread destruction was seen in the suburbs surrounding Kyiv, including Bucha, Irpin and Borodyanka. Burned-out cars litter the roadways. ABC News foreign correspondent James Longman, who reported from Borodyanka on Wednesday, described an apartment complex ""cut in half"" and another building that had so much of its exterior blown off that it's possible to ""see right into people's homes."" The town of Borodyanka, about 30 miles northwest of Kyiv, ""is almost destroyed,"" Oleksiy Kuleba, the governor of Kyiv Oblast, said Tuesday after visiting the Borodyanka. After Ukrainian officials began to discover the atrocities committed in Bucha, Ukrainian prosecutor-general Iryna Venediktova said the situation in Borodyanka, about 50 miles northwest of Kyiv, could be worse. ""In fact, the worst situation, when we talk about civilian casualties in Kyiv region, is in Borodyanka,"" Venediktova said Monday on Ukrainian TV. The death toll in Borodyanka and other liberated cities may be even higher than in Bucha, where at least 300 people were killed or tortured, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in an address on Monday. Russian troops occupied Borodyanka even longer than Bucha. ""We are already doing everything possible to identify all the Russian military involved in these crimes as soon as possible -- everything to punish them,"" Zelenskyy said. ""This will be a joint work of our state with the European Union and international institutions, in particular with the International Criminal Court."" Haunting drone video filmed in early March showed the extent of devastation and destruction in residential areas of Borodyanka after strikes from Russian forces began. Humanitarian corridors from Borodyanka had been established as Ukrainian nationalists moved into residential areas of the town, Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov said on March 3. It is unclear how many were able to flee the small town of about 13,000. Zelenskyy began recounting the annihilation of Borodyanka as early as March 5, detailing destroyed schools and the Kharkiv Assumption Cathedral, which had been badly damaged in the air raids. ""Look what Russia has done,"" Zelenskyy said in a March 5 address. ""It did it right in front of your eyes. Protect yourself!""

He was desperate to share his story but shook from the trauma of it. Pavlyuk, 53, was one of the surviving residents of the besieged Ukrainian town, northwest of Kyiv, where gruesome evidence of killings and torture has come to light following the withdrawal of Russian forces. He told ABC News that when Russian troops came to his apartment building, they killed all the men who were younger than 50, including two of Pavlyuk's friends. Pavlyuk said he was given 20 minutes to bury them. He showed ABC News the shallow graves he hastily dug in the backyard, each marked with a plank of wood and topped with a religious icon. He wanted to give them whatever dignity he could. ""But it's too shallow,"" Pavlyuk said. ""I just wanted to protect them from the dogs."" Pavlyuk and other residents spoke with ABC News in the days after Russian forces departed Bucha, leaving an apparent trail of death, destruction, terror and trauma that has shaken the international community. Hundreds of people were said to have been killed during the occupation. When ABC News arrived on Tuesday, bodies still lay in the streets. World leaders have called for an investigation into whether war crimes, including genocide, were committed. When Russian troops arrived in Bucha in late February, they asked everyone for documentation and forced the men to strip down naked to reveal any tattoos, according to Pavlyuk. They immediately shot and killed anyone whom they deemed a threat, without asking any questions, he said. The mayor of the nearby village of Motyzhyn, Olga Sukhenko, and her family appear to have met the same fate. ABC News witnessed their lifeless bodies in a wooded area. Another Bucha resident, who declined to give her name, told ABC News her husband was also forced to remove his clothes to show whether he had any tattoos. Russian soldiers took over Pavlyuk's apartment building, turning the homes of Ukrainian families into wartime dormitories for drunk, violent thugs, he said. Rooms that Pavlyuk showed ABC News were strewn with blankets and old food. Pavlyuk said he and his wife lived in the basement for more than month with little food or water, only leaving to cook on a stove outside. He told ABC News they faced the constant fear of an arbitrary killing or a random act of violence, like when a friend was killed by a grenade he said was thrown as a joke by a drunk soldier. The friend's body parts lay outside on the ground for days until Pavlyuk was allowed to gather them, put them in a bag and bury them in a grave next to his two other friends, he said. More bodies were dumped in a mass grave outside a church. Residents had gone out to collect some of the dead from the streets while the town was under Russian occupation. The trench was filled with bodies in black plastic bags that lay on top of other victims, who were either wrapped in sheets or nothing at all. Locals told ABC News there could be as many as 90 people buried there. Russian forces invaded neighboring Ukraine on Feb. 24, seizing territory and bombing entire cities. As the war grinds on, Russia faces strong resistance from Ukraine, whose troops managed to take back some territory in recent days as Russian forces retreated. According to Ukrainian Prosecutor General Iryna Venedyktova, at least 410 civilians have been found dead in Bucha and other recently recaptured towns near Ukraine's capital, where there's an ongoing investigation into possible war crimes committed by Russian forces. Graphic images have emerged from Bucha showing unarmed individuals in civilian clothes who appear to have been executed with their hands or legs bound, sparking outrage from the United States as well as a number of other nations and institutions. Russia has denied responsibility, calling the images ""fake"" and saying all of its units withdrew completely from Bucha around March 30. An ABC News analysis of videos and satellite imagery confirms some of the bodies seen lying in the streets of Bucha were there as early as March 19, when the town was still occupied by Russian forces, contradicting Russia's claims that the scene was ""staged"" after its troops left. While in Bucha, ABC News encountered a Human Rights Watch team gathering evidence of war crimes. ""What we've seen so far and what we've heard from residents -- what we've been documenting -- is really horrific, including reports that Russian forces have pulled people out of their homes, briefly interrogated them and then executed them,"" said Richard Weir, a researcher in the Crisis and Conflict division at Human Rights Watch. A team from the International Committee of the Red Cross was also on scene in Bucha, assessing needs and delivering humanitarian aid. ""Humanitarian situation is dire,"" ICRC spokesperson Alyona Synenko told ABC News. ""We have seen extremely vulnerable people -- elderly, people with limited mobility, people who are sick, who are alone in their unheated apartments with no electricity, with no running water, with medical needs."" Bucha residents Tatyana Chernysh and her husband told ABC News they must have survived ""by God's will"" when so many of their neighbors did not. ""At any time, the occupiers could enter our premises and do with us whatever they wanted,"" said Chernysh's husband, who said he was too frightened to give his first name. ""It was terrifying. It was awful."" The couple didn't leave their house while Russian troops occupied the town. They said ""good people"" brought them food and medicine. Although the Russian soldiers camped away from their home, Chernysh and her husband said they heard unyielding gunfire and that stray bullets pockmarked their house. Since the withdrawal of Russian forces and the recent arrival of aid, Chernysh and her husband have finally come out of hiding to see what remains of their battered town. They recalled seeing bodies strewn across the streets and sidewalks. ""It is obvious their intention was to destroy Ukraine, destroy our people, destroy our economy, destroy our culture,"" Chernysh's husband said of the Russian troops. ""They claimed they came to liberate. They didn't. They are terrorists."" After surviving such ""senseless"" horror, the family said they ""feel safe"" and intend to stay in Bucha, despite a lack of electricity, running water and reliable communication. ""It's where we live. We don't want to yield our homes to occupiers,"" Chernysh's husband said. ""It is our town. It is our home. We are going to stay."" Although he admitted they might think twice if Russian forces return. ""Hopefully they won’t come back,"" he added, ""but with them you can never tell.""",13,,,,23
2022-04-05,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/International/photos-show-devastation-bucha-wake-russian-invasion/story?id=83872938,Photos show devastation in Bucha in wake of Russian invasion,"A man lay sprawled by the roadside in the Ukrainian city of Bucha on Sunday, his hands tied behind his back and a bullet wound to his head, one of hundreds of local residents that officials say have been found dead in the wake of five weeks of Russian occupation. Bucha's deputy mayor, Taras Shapravskyi, said 50 of the dead residents, found after Russian forces withdrew from the city late last week, were the victims of extra-judicial killings carried out by Russian troops, and the officials have accused Moscow of war crimes. Russia's defense ministry said in a statement issued Sunday that all photographs and videos published by the Ukrainian authorities alleging ""crimes"" by Russian troops in Bucha were a ""provocation"" and claimed no resident of Bucha suffered violence at the hands of Russian troops. Reuters was not able to independently verify who was responsible for killing the dead residents. But three bodies seen by Reuters reporters on Sunday -- the corpse with the hands bound and two others that did not have bound hands -- bore bullet shots to the head consistent with what Bucha mayor Anatoliy Fedoruk and his deputy described as executions. In all three cases, there were no signs of any other significant injuries elsewhere in the body. All three people shot in the head were male, and all three were dressed in civilian clothing. On the body of the person whose hands were bound, there were powder burn marks on his lips and face. Such marks can mean a person was shot at close range. The cloth used to bind the man's hands appeared to be a white armband. Russian troops, while they were in Bucha, required that local residents wear the armbands to identify themselves, according to one woman who was still wearing hers. Reuters sent questions to the Kremlin and the Russian defense ministry about the corpses that its reporters had witnessed but received no immediate reply. Russia's defense ministry in its statement Sunday said: ""During the time that Russian armed forces were in control of this settlement, not a single local resident suffered from any violent actions."" It added that before Russian troops withdrew on March 30, they delivered 452 tons of humanitarian aid to civilians around the Kyiv region. Shapravskyi, the deputy mayor, said some 300 people were found dead after the Russian withdrawal. Of these, he said, officials so far have logged 50 as executions carried out by Russian forces. Reuters could not independently verify those figures. The others were either killed in crossfire, or their deaths are so far unexplained. ""Any war has some rules of engagement for civilians. The Russians have demonstrated that they were consciously killing civilians,"" Fedoruk, the mayor, said as he showed Reuters reporters one of the bodies. Reuters also spoke to one local resident who described a person being found dead after Russian troops detained them, and another resident who described two people found dead with single gunshot wounds to the head. Reuters was not able to independently verify the descriptions provided by the residents. Sobbing as she gestured at her husband's shallow grave, a shot of vodka topped with a cracker resting on freshly dug earth, Tetyana Volodymyrivna recounted an ordeal at the hands of Russian troops in this city 23 miles northwest of Kyiv. She said she and her husband, a former Ukrainian marine, were dragged from their apartment when Russian troops set up their command center in their building. The soldiers held them prisoner in the apartment building where they lived. She said the Russians, when they arrived in the city, asked people who they were and demanded to see documents. She said a fighter with the Russian forces who she believed was from Russia's semi-autonomous Chechnya region warned he would ""cut us up."" She did not say how she knew he was Chechen. Reuters sent a request for comment to the office of the leader of Chechnya, Ramzan Kadyrov, a Kremlin loyalist, but received no reply. Tetyana, who identified herself by her first name and patronymic but did not give her family name, was released after being held for four days. Her husband was nowhere to be seen for several days, until she was told about some bodies in a basement stairwell of the building where she and her husband lived. ""I recognized him by his sneakers, his trousers. He looked mutilated, his body was cold,"" she said. ""My neighbor still has a picture of his face. He had been shot in the head, mutilated, tortured."" Reuters reviewed the photograph, which showed that the face and body were badly mutilated. The news agency could not determine if there was a bullet wound. After recovering her husband's body, she and some neighbors buried it in a garden plot near their building, just deep enough ""so dogs wouldn't eat him,"" she said. Another corpse still lay in the stairwell where her husband was found, a Reuters reporter saw. Local residents covered the body with a bedsheet as a mark of dignity. Around the corner, another grave contained the remains of two men, a resident told Reuters. She said the men had been taken away by Russian troops, but she did not witness them being killed. When the bodies were found, both had been shot through the left eye, she said. Six other residents gathered near the grave said her account was correct. One of the residents said she recognized one of the dead men as a tenant in the apartment complex, who she said was a retired member of the Ukrainian military. Bucha was captured in the days immediately after the Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine by Russian forces who swept south, capturing the defunct nuclear reactor at Chernobyl and moving southward toward the capital. Bucha and the northern outskirts of nearby Irpin were the point at which the Russian advance from the northwest was halted after they met with unexpectedly fierce resistance from Ukrainian forces. The area witnessed some of the bloodiest fighting of the battle for the capital, until Russian forces pulled back from north of Kyiv. Moscow said in late March it was regrouping to focus on battles in eastern Ukraine. On Saturday, Ukraine said its forces had retaken all areas around Kyiv and that it now had complete control of the capital region for the first time since the invasion. On Sunday, roads in Bucha were littered with unexploded ordnance. Rockets poked out of the tarmac near burned-out wrecks of tanks. Some residents scrawled ""Beware, mines"" on their walls in chalk after finding booby traps or missiles on their premises. Resident Volodomir Kopachov said Russians troops had set up a rocket system in a vacant lot next to his garden. When a Reuters reporter visited, boxes of ammunition and spent shell casings littered the ground. Kopachov, a Ukrainian dog breeder, was in mourning. He said his 33-year-old daughter, her boyfriend and a friend were shot dead by Russian troops after firing a party streamer toward them just days before the pullback. Kopachov's wife said they fired the streamer as a gesture of defiance, not with the intent of harming the soldiers. ""It is so hard to go through it all,"" said the 69-year-old, as 10 Alabai, a breed of prized Central Asian Shepherd dog, barked in his backyard. Kopachov said he had not ventured beyond the gates of his house for a month. ""They were killing [people] on the spot. No one asked: 'Who you are, why you are out?' The men were simply shot."" The Kremlin denies that it has invaded Ukraine, saying it is carrying out a ""special military operation"" to degrade the Ukrainian armed forces and is targeting military installations rather than carrying out strikes on civilian areas. Speaking in Hostomel, near Bucha, on Sunday, Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov said: ""This is not a special operation, these are not police actions. ... These are inhumans who simply committed crimes against civilians."" Reporting by Simon Gardner for Reuters",13,,,,23
2022-04-05,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/zelenskyy-challenges-punish-russia-simply-close-doors-analysis/story?id=83884670,Zelenskyy challenges UN to punish Russia or 'simply close' its doors: ANALYSIS,"In an impassioned address to the United Nations Security Council Tuesday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy laid down the gauntlet -- urging the U.N.'s most powerful body to either act or ""dissolve yourself altogether."" It was a challenge to the world's diplomats sitting in the historic chamber in New York, where any action to even condemn Russia's invasion has been blocked by Russia's veto power as a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council. But it was also a searing indictment of the U.N. system itself, created in the ashes of World War II to ensure international peace and security. U.N. aid agencies are on the ground providing assistance, its human rights chief is monitoring reported war crimes, including new, shocking images of murdered civilians in the Kyiv suburb of Bucha, and nearly three-fourths of its members have joined to condemn Russia's invasion. But none of that has stopped Russian leader Vladimir Putin's brutal campaign to topple the Ukrainian government and subjugate the country, ""Where is the security that the Security Council needs to guarantee?"" Zelenskyy asked. ""It is obvious the key institution of the world ... simply cannot work effectively."" Top U.N. officials attended the session Tuesday, including Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, who lamented how the war was now fueling food and fuel crises and threatening to throw more people around the world into hunger. ""For all these reasons, it is more urgent by the day to silence the guns. ... The war in Ukraine must stop -- now,"" he told the chamber. But weeks of condemnation by Guterres and other U.N. diplomats have fallen on deaf ears in Moscow, which continues to use its prominent perch on the Security Council to spread disinformation about the war and accuse Ukraine of provocations, lies, and fakes. On Tuesday, its envoy Vasily Nebenzya again spoke repeatedly to say the atrocities reported by eyewitnesses and journalists in Bucha were ""staged."" The failure to reproach Nebenzya for his near daily false claims is yet another way the U.N.'s credibility has taken a hit during the crisis, according to some critics. In his remarks, Zelenskyy himself said the U.N. could be ""simply closed"" if it doesn't act to punish Russia for its invasion of his country -- ""if there is nothing that you can do besides conversation."" U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Linda Thomas-Greenfield pushed back on that gently in an interview after the session, telling the BBC Zelensky ""is not exactly right."" ""No one can question his frustration with the council and how the council operates. The Russians do have veto power. But I have said over and over again -- they cannot veto our voices, they can't veto his voice,"" Thomas-Greenfield said. But Zelenskyy made clear that for Ukraine, that is not enough. He demanded that ""the Russian military and those who gave them orders must be brought to justice immediately"" -- urging for ""complete truth and full accountability."" As he detailed horrific atrocities in Bucha and elsewhere - he said worse is yet to be discovered in the cities still held by Russian forces. But he also called for wholesale reform of the U.N. system -- saying that the international body has not lived up to the goals set out at its founding in San Francisco after World War II, and that those goals cannot be reached without reforms. He called for Russia to be expelled from the Security Council or for it to be reformed at a global conference, including ending the veto power. ""The veto is not the right to die,"" he added. ""No more exceptions or privileges."" There is no effort underway to expel Russia from the Security Council or the General Assembly, the U.N.'s main chamber -- where all 193 countries have a vote, but whose resolutions are non-binding. An expulsion from the U.N. requires a recommendation from the Security Council itself -- where Russia wields that veto power -- and then a vote by the General Assembly. That veto power -- shared with the four other permanent members China, the U.S., the United Kingdom, and France -- has rendered the Security Council powerless to even pass a resolution condemning the Kremlin's invasion. Either way, Putin seems to care little for paper condemnations like U.N. resolutions. The night he launched his war and the bombs started to fall across Ukraine, U.N. diplomats were meeting at the same time in New York late at night to discuss the threat of war, their words ringing even more hollow. Instead of fully expelling Russia, the U.S. is pushing with its allies and partners, including Ukraine, to suspend Russia from the U.N. Human Rights Council. The body's 47 members are elected among U.N. member states for three-year terms, but a country can be suspended with a two-thirds majority vote in the U.N. General Assembly. ""Our votes can make a real difference. Russia's participation in the U.N. Human Rights Council hurts the council's credibility, it undermines the entire U.N., and it is just plain wrong. Let us come together to do what is right and do right by the Ukrainian people,"" Thomas-Greenfield told her fellow diplomats in the chamber. U.S. officials have said they believe they have the votes necessary -- pointing to two previous resolutions passed by the General Assembly to condemn Russia's invasion with 141 and 140 votes, respectively. A vote could be held as soon as Thursday, Thomas-Greenfield said. While only one other country has faced that kind of censure -- Libya in 2011 after Muammar Gaddafi's forces opened fire on protesters -- Russia has already dismissed the efforts, with Nebenzya vowing nothing will stop the Kremlin's campaign. ""We need to cut out the malignant Nazi tumor that is consuming Ukraine and would in time begin to consume Russia, and we will achieve that goal, I hope sooner rather than later, because there is no other outcome,"" he said.",13,,,,25
2022-04-04,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/biden-calls-russias-killing-ukrainian-civilians-war-crime/story?id=83865128,Biden calls Russia's killing of Ukrainian civilians a war crime but not genocide,"The killing of Ukrainian civilians committed by Russian forces in Ukraine is a war crime, President Joe Biden said Monday -- repeating his accusation that Russian President Vladimir Putin is a ""war criminal"" who needs to be held ""accountable."" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy accused Russia of ""genocide"" on Sunday after hundreds of Ukrainian civilians were found killed in Bucha, a suburb of the capital Kyiv that was retaken by Ukrainian forces. Some of the civilians were buried in mass graves, others found dead in the street with their hands tied behind their backs. ""These are war crimes, and they will be recognized by the world as genocide. You are here today and can see what happened. We know of thousands of people killed and tortured, with severed limbs, raped women, murdered children. I think it is more than -- this is a genocide,"" Zelenskyy told reporters in Bucha Monday. The U.S. has stopped short of using the term ""genocide"" because of its strict legal definition and the heavy implications it carries. Asked whether the latest reported atrocities are genocide, Biden told reporters, ""No, I think it is a war crime."" He called again for an investigation and trial, even seeming to suggest that Putin himself should face trial himself. ""We have to continue to provide Ukraine with the weapons they need to continue the fight, and we have to gather all the detail so this can be an actual -- have a war crimes trial,"" Biden said. ""This guy is brutal and what's happening with Bucha is outrageous, and everyone's seeing it,"" he added. While stopping short of labeling it ""genocide,"" Biden's call for for a possible war crimes trial raises the pressure on the international community's response to Russia's war, which has killed thousands and displaced more than 10 million people in less than six weeks. Biden said he would seek more sanctions against Putin and his government over the atrocities in Bucha, although it's unclear if more economic pressure will do anything to bring an end to Putin's campaign, even as it has shifted away from the Kyiv area to the south and east. In Bucha and other towns outside Kyiv, the U.S. has also seen ""credible reports of torture, rape, and civilians executed alongside their families,"" according to State Department spokesperson Ned Price -- all of which would be considered war crimes under international law. In southern Ukraine, especially around the besieged city Mariupol, the U.S. is aware of ""reports of tens of thousands abducted or deported by Russia's forces and shocking descriptions of rape, assaults, and murders perpetrated by Russia's forces,"" Price added. The Kremlin has suggested that the scenes out of Bucha, reported publicly by eyewitnesses, reporters, and Ukrainian government officials, were fabricated -- a tactic used repeatedly by Russian officials. Last month, the State Department announced it had made a legal assessment that Russian forces were committing war crimes in Ukraine, including targeting civilians and civilian infrastructure and indiscriminately firing on civilian areas. That assessment was based on public reporting and U.S. intelligence, including intercepted communications between Russian forces, according to U.S. Ambassador-at-Large for Global Criminal Justice Beth Van Schaack. That could implicate Putin himself, according to Van Schaack, who told reporters it depended on what jurisdiction was hearing cases. Her office at the State Department has continued to document and analyze evidence in preparation for trials. But while her office also assists in genocide determinations, U.S. officials have so far avoided using the term. ""We have seen atrocities. We have seen war crimes. We have not yet seen a level of systematic deprivation of life of the Ukrainian people to rise to the level of genocide, but again, that's something we'll continue to monitor,"" Biden's national security adviser Jake Sullivan said Monday. Genocide is an attempt ""to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnic, racial, or religious group,"" according to the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, the 1948 treaty that banned it. It can involve acts of killing or harm, as well as preventing births, forcibly transferring children, or imposing dire conditions that are ""calculated to bring about its physical destruction,"" per the treaty. While Russian forces have targeted Ukrainian civilians, including now with executions, it seems that for U.S. officials, the scale is at this point not large enough to prove an intent to destroy the Ukrainian people. Sullivan used the terms ""mass death"" and ""mass incarceration"" and added that if there is ""a level of atrocity, a level of killing, a level of intentional activity that rises to meet our definition of genocide, we'll call it for what it is."" There are several international investigations underway right now into potential war crimes in Ukraine. The International Criminal Court, which conducts individual prosecutions, launched an investigation in early March, while the United Nations Human Rights Council voted to create a panel of experts to investigate, finally naming its members last week. The U.S. is also supporting a multinational team of independent war crimes investigators, including American experts, that are working with Ukraine's prosecutor-general on her office's probe of Russian war crimes, Price announced. But while the State Department supports those various investigations, its genocide determinations can take years to complete. Last month, Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced he had determined that Myanmar's military had committed genocide against the Rohingya -- nearly five years after the Muslim ethnic minority faced a campaign of terror that killed thousands and displaced nearly one million to neighboring Bangladesh.

2022-04-01,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/ukrainians-hunting-russians-leave-kyiv-area-pentagon-update/story?id=83799022,Ukrainians hunting Russians as they leave Kyiv area: Pentagon update Day 36,"The Pentagon has been providing daily updates on the Russian invasion of Ukraine and Ukraine's efforts to resist. Here are highlights of what a senior U.S. defense official told reporters Wednesday on Day 36: Russians being hunted as they withdraw from Kyiv area The U.S. continues to see roughly 20% of the Russian forces that were arrayed against Kyiv repositioning away from the capital, the official said. And Ukrainian forces are attacking these troops as they withdraw from the area. ""As these forces begin to reposition, the Ukrainians are moving against them,"" the official said. Most of the Russian forces that are repositioning were located to the north and northwest of Kyiv. Most notably, they seem to have abandoned Hostomel airport, which has been a site of intense fighting at various points since the beginning of the invasion. ""We believe that they have very likely abandoned Hostomel airfield,"" the official said. Although some troops are repositioning, long-range strikes on Kyiv continue. ""Despite the rhetoric of de-escalation, we're still observing artillery fire and airstrikes in and around Kyiv,"" the official said. Shifting focus to Donbas ""This repositioning that they're doing around Kyiv and other places in the north, and this reprioritization on the Donbas, clearly indicates that they know they have failed to take the capital city, that they know they have been under increased pressure elsewhere around the country,"" the official said. While Russia might be dedicating more forces to taking control of the Donbas region, the Ukrainians are primed to make it a tough fight. ""The Ukrainians know the territory very, very well. They have a lot of forces still there, and they're absolutely fighting very hard for that area, as they have over the last eight years,"" the official said. ""So just because they're going to prioritize it and put more force there or more energy there doesn't mean it's going to be easy for them."" Russian ships can hit Donbas While there are still no signs of any imminent amphibious landings, Russia has several ships in the Black Sea and Sea of Azov that could be used to threaten the Donbas region with cruise missiles, the official said. Putin not getting full picture from advisers ""Our assessment is that the planning for this war was done with a very small circle of people, and that Mr. Putin's advisers do not count many. And, you know, our assessment is that they have not been completely honest with him about how it's going,"" the official said. The official said Russian President Vladimir Putin has kept to a ""very, very close circle,"" a leadership style that inherently limits access to information. ""I can't account for the fact that the people advising him have chosen to obstruct certain information or omit certain information. All we can say is we don't believe that he has been getting the full picture,"" the official said. Odesa under blockade ""We know that the Russians have continued to blockade Odesa,"" the official said. ""So obviously it's having it's having an economic impact there."" Kherson contested ""We assess that they're still fighting over Kherson. We know that the Russians are in the city, but we aren't prepared to call it for one side or the other at this point. I mean, it had been in Russian control, but the Ukrainians are attempting to retake Kherson, so it's still being fought over,"" the official said. Bombardment of Mariupol continues ""I don't have an update on the degree to which a cease-fire is being applied in Mariupol. What I try to give you is what we've seen, you know, in the last 24 hours since we last talked, and we have continued to see Mariupol will come under airstrikes,"" the official said.",14,,,,1
2022-04-01,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/US/key-lessons-ukraine-conflict-conventional-warfare/story?id=83746590,Key lessons from the Ukraine conflict about conventional warfare,"More than a month into Russia's invasion, the Ukrainian military has fared better than many expected given its smaller size, budget and number of munitions compared to its adversary. This week, Ukrainian forces reclaimed a town in the northeastern part of the country, while Russian ground forces have stalled around the capital, with some troops moving away from Kyiv and nearby Chernihiv, U.S. officials said. Intelligence experts had initially anticipated that Russia would take Kyiv within days of its attack on Ukraine. ""They failed to take Kyiv, which we believe was a key objective,"" Pentagon spokesman John Kirby told reporters this week. ""Not only do they not manage to take Kyiv, they've not managed to take any population centers and the Ukrainians have been fighting back very hard."" Among the factors shaping the ""David and Goliath"" conflict up to this point has been Ukraine's ""smart tactical use"" of its anti-tank and anti-aircraft weapons, alongside poor planning on the part of Russia, according to retired Gen. Robert Abrams, an ABC News contributor and the former commander of U.S. forces in Korea. ""'They [Russia] have numerical superiority, that's a fact. … They have an enormous missile inventory compared to Ukrainians,"" he said. ""That being said, what we overestimated though, is their ... warfighting competence."" Within days of its invasion, Russia was struggling with fuel and logistics supplies, and verified images and videos of destroyed Russian military vehicles and tanks circulated online. In its latest casualty numbers, Russia’s general staff said late last week that 1,351 Russian soldiers have been killed so far, though NATO last week estimated that between 7,000 and 15,000 had died. The West has worked quickly to send weaponry to Ukraine since the start of the invasion. The U.S. and NATO supplied Ukraine with more than 17,000 anti-tank weapons, including Javelin missiles, in less than a week, the New York Times reported in early March. The U.S. has sent hundreds of millions of dollars worth of military aid into Ukraine, including anti-tank and anti-aircraft weapons such as the Javelin and Stinger systems, which can be fired by just one or two people. Other countries, including Germany and the U.K., have provided similar weapons. The shoulder-mounted Javelin in particular has become a symbol of Ukrainian resistance. Known as a ""fire and forget"" weapon, the Javelin uses an infrared guidance system to travel toward a target, allowing the gunner to fire and then immediately take cover. The missile system can destroy tanks and other armored vehicles. The shoulder-fired Stinger missiles target low-flying aircraft. During a Congressional hearing Tuesday, Gen. Tod Wolters, the top U.S. military commander in Europe, praised Ukraine’s military and their ability to stall Russian military operations throughout the country, especially through the weapons systems being provided by the U.S. military. ""The Ukrainian armed forces show a very, very positive learning curve, and so I'm optimistic about being able to force additional stalling on behalf of the Russians,"" he said. The Javelin and Stinger, which have been used by the U.S. military for over 30 years, are ""very, very effective at what they're intended to do,"" Abrams said. A lone defender could help keep the attacking enemy at bay up to 2 miles away, and aircraft about 6 miles away, he said, showing the power of their range and precision. With enough weapons, ""a defender can keep a much larger enemy force that's mounted in their armored vehicles and trucks, and can keep them at bay because they can't ever get close enough to touch the defenders,"" he said. ""That's really what the advantage is of using these systems."" Anti-tank weapons aren't always a guarantee of success, Abrams said, noting that the attacking force could use a strategy known as combined arms maneuver to defeat them. That might look like firing artillery in advance of armored columns, using smoke -- an obscurant -- to prevent the Ukrainian gunners from seeing the Russian targets and integrating helicopters, he said. To Ukraine's advantage, the Russians are not utilizing this strategy, according to Abrams. ""Frankly, they've made it much, much easier for the Ukrainian defenders with these weapon systems that are getting so much notoriety,"" Abrams said. At the same time, the Ukrainians have carefully chosen where to use these weapons systems ""to maximum advantage"" on their home turf, he said. ""What we're seeing though is such poor tactics by the Russians, it has compounded the effects of the Ukrainian's use of these anti-tank weapons systems,"" Abrams said. The Ukrainians are ""putting up one heck of a fight,"" he added. ""They're utilizing excellent tactics where they are maximizing the effect of their weapons system with the terrain. … I don't want to minimize that. But the Russian army has been equally inept, and it's been a tactical disaster."" Russia's military said last week that it had generally accomplished the ""first stage of the operation"" and reduced the Ukrainian forces ""considerably,"" and would focus on its"" ""top goal"" -- liberating the Donbas region. Russia has claimed to have destroyed thousands of Ukraine's military vehicles, including tanks, and hundreds of aircraft during its so-called military operation. Amid pleas from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy for more weapons, one potential concern is supply. There is not an unlimited supply of anti-tank and anti-aircraft missiles, Abrams said. ""I suspect as the defense industry cranks up production, that there's going to be some supply chain problems,"" he said. ""For Ukraine specifically, they're going to have a supply management challenge, whereby they're going to have to be very smart in how they distribute these key munitions."" Another ""decisive factor"" in Ukraine's war-fighting competence has been training, Abrams said. After Russia invaded Ukraine and annexed Crimea in 2014, military aid from the West has included helping Ukrainian soldiers improve their tactical fighting. ""Russia clearly has the numbers, they have the technological advantage, but we're seeing the value of high-quality training, tough realistic training,"" combined with ""this very precise, exquisite capability for anti-tank and anti-aircraft weapons systems,"" Abrams said. ""They are achieving success and they have denied Russia and their initial objectives in this war."" Ukraine has also begun developing a noncommissioned officer corps -- considered the backbone of the military, who have extensive education and are empowered to lead soldiers, the retired general said. Russia, by contrast, has not made a commitment in noncommissioned officers, and instead is very centralized in who has the authority to give orders and has had several senior Russian army leaders reportedly killed in action, Abrams said. ""We're seeing the benefits of this training, in this professional development, as it plays out on the battlefield,"" Abrams said. ""We're seeing these small groups of Ukrainian soldiers seemingly outnumbered and outgunned achieving amazing success."" ""When you have the power of junior leaders and non-commissioned officers with the right equipment, and they have freedom of action to make decisions to seize the initiative when initiative appears, to take initiative and make those tough decisions without having to call someone -- that is often the difference between victory and defeat on the battlefield,"" he said.

Vande Hei shared a spacecraft with two Russian cosmonauts as tensions between the Russia and the U.S. continue amid the ongoing war in Ukraine. Vande Hei returned in a Soyuz spacecraft with Russian cosmonauts Pyotr Dubrov and Anton Shkaplerov, making a parachute-assisted landing at 7:28 a.m. in Dzhezkazgan, Kazakhstan. The trio had departed the International Space Station at 3:21 a.m. ET. Vande Hei broke the record for the longest spaceflight by a NASA astronaut by 15 days. The record was previously held by retired astronaut Scott Kelly. On this spaceflight, Vande Hei completed 5,680 orbits of the Earth and a journey of more than 150 million miles, roughly the equivalent of 312 trips to the Moon and back, according to NASA. This trip gave Vande Hei a lifetime total of 523 days in space. ""Mark's mission is not only record-breaking, but also paving the way for future human explorers on the Moon, Mars, and beyond,"" NASA administrator Bill Nelson said in a press release. ""Our astronauts make incredible sacrifices in the name of science, exploration, and cutting-edge technology development, not least among them time away from loved ones."" Nelson added: ""NASA and the nation are proud to welcome Mark home and grateful for his incredible contributions throughout his year-long stay on the International Space Station."" According to NASA, Vande Hei contributed to dozens of studies from the hundreds executed during his mission, including six science investigations supported by NASA’s Human Research Program. As NASA plans to return to the Moon, under the Artemis program, and prepares for the exploration of Mars, the agency said Vande Hei's extended mission will provide researchers the opportunity to observe the effects of long-duration spaceflight on humans. After the crew goes through post-landing medical checks, they will be flown to the recovery staging city in Karaganda, Kazakhstan, on Russian helicopters. Vande Hei will then board a NASA plane to Cologne, Germany, for refueling, prior to his return home. Shkaplerov and Dubrov will be flown home to Star City, Russia, on a Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center aircraft. ABC’s Jim Ryan reports:",3,,,,9

Here are highlights of what a senior U.S. defense official told reporters Friday on Day 30: In apparent shift, Russian offensive toward Kyiv stopped, troops now in defensive positions The official described how Russian forces around Kyiv appear to have stopped offensive operations toward the capital city and are moving into defensive positions as they seem to be prioritizing offensive operations in the Donbas, the eastern part of the country. ""It appears that the Russians are at the moment not pursuing a ground offense or ground offensive towards Kiev,"" said the official. They are digging in. They are establishing defensive positions."" However, the official said that the bombardment of the city using long-range weapons is continuing. ""They don't show any signs of being willing to move on Kyiv from the ground,"" said the official. ""And that is in keeping with our assessment of a couple of days ago that they are going to prioritize the eastern part of the country with in terms of ground offense. And that is exactly what we're seeing."" Earlier on Friday, a top Russian general told reporters that Russia's initial military operations had been completed and that operations would now focus ""on the most important thing, the complete liberation of Donbas."" ""They have stopped trying to move forward and what they have started to do is try to defend what they have,"" said the senior U.S. defense official. ""We're seeing the Ukrainians really go now on the offense on them around Kyiv and that includes to the west of it."" The official described heavy fighting in the towns of Bucha and Irpin northwest of Kyiv where he said the Ukrainians are 'trying hard to dislodge the Russians.'"" Russian military now prioritizing operations in Donbas in eastern Ukraine ""They are putting their priorities and their effort in the east of Ukraine and that's where still there remains a lot of heavy fighting,"" said the official. ""We think they are trying to not only secure some sort of more, more substantial gains there as a potential negotiating tactic at the table, but also to cut off Ukrainian forces in the eastern part of the country."" ""They are more focused on the Donbas,"" said the official, describing the easternmost area of the country where Russian-backed separatists have been fighting against Ukraine's military for the past eight years. ""The defensive crouch that they're now taking in Kyiv, we think is consistent with their desire now to be more on the offense and to be more aggressive in the east and Donbas."" And that includes increased air bombardment in the region including in the port city of Mariupol that continues to see what the official described as ""vicious vicious fighting."" Russian forces lose full control of strategic southern city of Kherson In a significant setback, Russian forces have lost full control of the strategic southern city of Kherson according to the official. If the Ukrainians were to retake the city, it would mark the first time that Russian troops will have been pushed out of a major city seized by Russia. ""It doesn't appear to be as solidly in Russian control as it was before,"" said the official. ""The Ukrainians are trying to take Kherson, but we would argue that Kherson is actually contested territory again."" If Ukrainian forces were to retake the port city, it ""would be a significant development, no question about that in terms of the southern part of the war,"" the official said. If that happened Russian troops would be ""sandwiched"" between Ukrainian forces in Mykolaiv to the west and Kherson, the official said. ""That would put them smack in the middle and that would make it very, very difficult for them to make any kind of ground movement on Odessa. If in fact, that was their plan,"" the official said. Russian reinforcements headed to Ukraine from Georgia ""We've seen our first indications that they are trying to send in some reinforcements from Georgia,"" said the official. ""We have seen the movement of some number of troops from Georgia. In recent days, U.S. officials have said that it appeared that Russia was seeking reinforcements for its military operations in Ukraine, but interestingly from outside of Russia. ""We don't have an exact number,"" said the official. ""I couldn't tell you whether it's a whole BTG (battalion tactical group) or how many troops."" Russian troops have been in breakaway Russian areas of Georgia since 2008. Russian missile failure rates between 20% and 60% The senior U.S. defense official did not dispute press reports that Russian missiles are failing to launch between 20% and 60% of the time. ""It's hard for us to assess that perfectly in terms of numbers, but we have seen some failures,"" said the official. ""The ranges I've seen in the press from anywhere from 20 to 60%. I would not push back on that assessment,"" said the official. ""But again, it's a range, and it's very nearly from day to day, but we have seen times ... when our assessment is they have they have experienced a significant amount of failure in their missiles,"" the official added. While the airspace over Ukraine remains contested, the official said that Russian planes are now flying about 300 sorties a day and are continuing to fire a lot of missiles that are causing their supplies to dwindle. ""They still have more than 50% but that's the air launch cruise missiles in particular the thing that they're running the lowest on,"" said the official.

2022-03-24,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/International/ukraines-lead-negotiator-talks-russia-months/story?id=83626948,Ukraine's lead negotiator says talks with Russia could take months,"Ukraine's lead negotiator in peace talks with Russia has said he believes the negotiations with Moscow are ""absolutely real,"" but has warned it may take months to reach a deal to end the war. Mykhailo Podolyak, a senior aide to President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, spoke to ABC News inside the heavily guarded compound of the presidential office in central Kyiv. ABC News reporters were brought through several rings of security into the building's darkened corridors, piled with sandbags to protect against shelling and empty except for Ukrainian special forces soldiers armed with assault rifles standing every few yards. Podolyak has been leading Ukraine's delegation at the talks that began within days after Russia's invasion. The first rounds were held in Belarus but recently the sides have switched to sessions by video link. Podolyak said the talks are now taking place every day by video, mostly at the level of working groups. Both sides in the last week have said the talks are making progress and that they are moving closer to a compromise, despite intense ongoing fighting. Ukrainian and American officials though have expressed doubts whether Russia is negotiating in good faith or might be using the talks just to buy time for its forces to regroup to press on with its war. But Podolyak said he was certain Russia was now genuinely negotiating, aware that it has no choice. ""They're absolutely real negotiations,"" Podolyak said. ""There's no attempt to stall for time. That's definitely not there."" But he warned that reaching an agreement could still take ""months."" Heavy losses inflicted on Russia, devastating Western sanctions and its failure to take any key cities, including Kyiv, have forced the Kremlin to moderate its demands, Podolyak said, meaning the two sides' positions are now far closer. ""Twenty-eight days of war have shown that Russia is not a country that can dictate conditions,"" he said. ""It seems to me they really do want to resolve some issues in negotiations, because there is the sanctions pressure, military pressure from Ukraine. We have already put them in their place."" But he said that more pressure from Ukraine's military, as well as international sanctions, was still needed to push Russia into negotiating positions that would allow for an agreement. Russia's core demand remains that Ukraine renounce its ambition to join NATO. In recent days, Zelenskyy and other Ukrainian officials have signaled they understand Ukraine will not join the alliance but have emphasized Ukraine wants security guarantees from Western countries to protect it from any future Russian aggression. Last week, the Financial Times and The Washington Post reported Russia and Ukraine were discussing a 15-point peace plan that would see Ukraine give up its NATO ambitions and accept some limits on its military in return for security guarantees from allies like the U.S., U.K. and Turkey. Russia is also demanding Ukraine recognize Russia's annexation of Crimea and the independence of two Russian-occupied separatist regions in eastern Ukraine, as well as legal provisions protecting the rights for the Russian language in Ukraine. Podolyak denied there is a 15-point plan as reported, saying it simply represented Russia's proposals. He said both sides had ""several drafts"" outlining their own positions but there was no ""agreed project."" Podolyak avoided saying whether Ukraine was now ready to give up its NATO ambitions, but stressed Ukraine is now seeking separate guarantees from willing NATO countries rather than membership in the alliance. He suggested that such guarantees from Western countries were essential to Ukraine if it is to sign any agreement. Those security guarantees appear a significant obstacle to a deal since it is unclear how any promise from a NATO country to defend Ukraine would differ from Ukraine de facto joining the alliance. Asked what sort of guarantees Ukraine is seeking, Podolyak suggested as an example that it could be ""legally enshrined"" that a no-fly zone will be imposed over Ukraine in the event of a new Russian attack. He declined to say which NATO countries Ukraine was discussing such guarantees with, since negotiations are ongoing, but he did not deny the U.S. was among them. Ukraine wants security guarantees so ""that Russia does not attack us in the future,"" he said. ""This requires not amorphous structures returning to the U.N., OSCE [Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe] or NATO, but effective alliances that will make it clear to Russia that it is not necessary to attack Ukraine's borders, as this will have very, very bad consequences."" The U.S. and other NATO countries have already repeatedly ruled out imposing a no-fly zone over Ukraine because it would lead to a direct conflict with Russia. The Kremlin's spokesman said Tuesday the talks were progressing ""much more slowly and less substantively than we would like"" and Russia has insisted it will still achieve the goals set at the beginning of its operation against Ukraine. Podolyak said that Russia's positions have already become far more ""appropriate,"" but that it still had ""illusions"" that Ukraine can be made to accept ultimatums. The danger, he said, was that the two countries were now moving into a phase of bloody stalemate that would see Russia cause heavy civilian casualties before it was finally forced into accepting a compromise. The timing to end the war, Podolyak said, would depend on how much Western support Ukraine now received. He said Ukraine needs more air defenses and anti-tank weapons and called for Western countries to impose a full embargo on Russian oil and stricter financial sanctions. The U.S. has sent hundreds of millions of dollars in weaponry to Ukraine, including a new $800 million cache now being delivered. ""I think right now they are in a state of shock and are trying to understand how low they might lower their demands so that we will start to agree with them on something,"" said Podolyak. ""It's a difficult process for them. For eight years they lived in illusions -- they thought they were world champions on the level with the United States."" He said continuing pain inflicted by Ukraine's military and more sanctions would force Russia to come to terms with the reality of its position. ""Russia will become more and more adequate and will come to the negotiating position, which will allow for the signing of an agreement not only with Russia -- for there's no point to a peace agreement with Russia -- but a multilaterally guaranteed agreement, where first of all there will be guarantor countries,"" he said.",29,,,,21
2022-03-24,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/doj-charges-russian-officials-hacking-campaigns-targeted-critical/story?id=83653235,DOJ charges Russian officials over hacking campaigns that targeted critical infrastructure,"The Justice Department unsealed two indictments Thursday charging four Russian government employees with two separate conspiracies -- outlining their alleged involvement in hacking campaigns that targeted critical infrastructure networks in the U.S. and across the globe between 2012 and 2018. Altogether, DOJ says the hacking campaigns ""targeted thousands of computers, at hundreds of companies and organizations, in approximately 135 countries."" The unsealing of the cases and their detailed hacking schemes, according to the Justice Department, are intended to serve as a warning amid the current tensions with Russia about the ""urgent ongoing need for American businesses to harden their defenses and remain vigilant."" ""The conduct alleged in these charges is the kind of conduct that we are concerned about under the current circumstances and has been addressed by various parts of the federal government,"" a senior FBI official told reporters Thursday. ""These charges show the dark art of the possible when it comes to critical infrastructure."" In the first case (reported earlier on this DL after its unsealing in D.C. district court), the Justice Department unsealed charges from June of last year against Russian government employee Evgeny Gladkikh who, along with unidentified co-conspirators, carried out hacking attacks that caused two separate emergency shutdowns at a foreign energy facility. They later failed when they allegedly sought to carry out a similar attack on a U.S. company that managed similar critical infrastructure entities. In a separate case charged in August of last year, the Justice Department charged three officers in Russia's FSB with carrying out a two-phased campaign to ""target and compromise the computers of hundreds of entities related to the energy sector worldwide."" ""Access to such systems would have provided the Russian government the ability to, among other things, disrupt and damage such computer systems at a future time of its choosing,"" the Justice Department said Thursday. The hacking attempts, according to investigators, were part of Russia's efforts to ""maintain surreptitious, unauthorized and persistent access to the computer networks of companies and organizations in the international energy sector, including oil and gas firms, nuclear power plants, and utility and power transmission companies."" The indictment alleges that in the first phase of the attacks, the FSB officers were able to install malware on ""more than 17,000 unique devices in the United States and abroad, including computer networks used by some power and energy companies. In the second phase, they carried out targeted spearphishing attacks against more than 3300 individuals from more than 500 U.S. and international companies, including U.S. agencies like the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. According to DOJ, they were actually able to successfully compromise servers that hosted websites visited by energy sector engineers -- when engineers visited a compromised website their login credentials would in some cases be secretly captured by the Russian malware. None of the individuals publicly identified by DOJ in the new indictments reside in the U.S., making it unlikely they will face arrest or extradition over the charges.",3,,,,29

Here are highlights of what a senior U.S. defense official told reporters Wednesday on Day 28: Russian troops face major setback east of Kyiv and moving into defensive positions In a significant movement, Ukraine's military forces have pushed back Russian forces east of Kyiv to 55 kilometers from the city center, according to a senior defense official. For weeks, and as recently as Tuesday, Russian forces have been kept at bay approximately 20 to 30 kilometers from the center of the capital city. The official said that Ukrainian forces near Bovary ""have been able to push the Russians back to about 55 kilometers east and northeast of Kyiv."" The ability to push back Russian forces nearly twice as far as where they had been for weeks is in line with what the official had said on Tuesday were indications that in some areas Ukrainian forces were attempting to retake territory taken by Russia. ""Ukrainians are not only in some of these places up sufficiently defending they're going on the offense in some of these places and actually pushing the Russians backwards, or in the case of Kiev, they're, they're basically forcing them into a defensive position,"" the official said Wednesday. The U.S. now assesses that Russian troops that have been stalled 12 to 15 kilometers north of the city are ""digging in"" and establishing defensive positions according to the official. ""They're forcing them into a defensive position"" the official told reporters on Wednesday. ""So it's not that they're not advancing, they're actually not trying to advance right now,"" said the official. ""They're taking more defensive positions."" ""We're starting to see him sort of dig in around Kyiv but really trying to go more on the offense than they have been, more energy applied, in that eastern part of Ukraine"" said the official. Ukrainians pushing back Russian troops in Cherniviv Meanwhile, Ukrainian troops in the city of Chernihiv, northeast of Kyiv, have also succeeded in slightly pushing back some of the Russian forces that have surrounded the city for weeks. The official described Ukrainians forces there as continuing to fight ""very hard"" against Russian forces to keep them out of the city and in some cases Russian troops have been ""ceding ground."" ""They are actually moving in the opposite direction, but not by much,"" the official said of Russian forces around the city. Russian troops now prioritizing operations in eastern Ukraine's Donbass region The official said Russia appears to be ""starting to prioritize"" their operations in the Donbass region of eastern Ukraine, particularly around Luhansk, to cut off Ukraine's military that has been fighting there against Russian separatists for the past eight years. ""We still believe that the Russians are trying to basically cut it off and therefore pin down Ukrainian forces that are that are in the Luhansk, Donetsk area,"" said the official. ""What we're seeing now is indications that the Russians are really starting to prioritize that part of eastern Ukraine,"" said the official. ""We believe that they are now going to start to apply, actually, they have applied a lot more energy in the Luhansk, Donetsk area, particularly around Luhansk. You're seeing them really put more energy and effort into that part of Ukraine."" The official has previously said that it appears that the Russian forces fighting to take over the southern port city of Mariupol so they can then push north into the Donbass to cut off the Ukrainian military. Meanwhile, the fighting in that city remains ""very very contested"" according to the official who also described the fighting there between Russian and Ukrainian troops as being ""hardcore."" The official noted that Russian forces continue to heavily bombard the city with artillery and long range missile fire. Meanwhile, it appears that recent Russian military activity around the western port city of Odessa that led to speculation of an attack on the city may have been a feint intended to ""pin down Ukrainian forces."" ""It's not entirely it's not entirely obvious that they actually will make a move on Odessa,"" said the official. ""So we're just we're just kind of watching that to see to see where it goes."" More US troops going forward to eastern Europe? The official said that Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin is always assessing the U.S. military presence in eastern Europe and has not ""taken off the table"" the possibility ""that he will flow more forces in from the United States or reposition from elsewhere in Europe."" But for now there are no announcements to make said the official who added that it's unclear what the U.S. military posture in eastern Europe will look like going forward. ""Certainly, the security environment in Europe is different now. And it will be different that it will be different no matter what the outcome is of this war,"" said the official. ""I think it's safe to say that the United States as well as other NATO nations will be taken a hard look at what it whether we have the footprint right and whether the posture is appropriate to the new security environment that results from all this,"" the official said. Russia has lots of missiles left to use According to the official, Russia has now launched more than 1,200 missiles into Ukraine, but ""we still assess that they have the vast majority of their of their assembled available inventory of surface to air missiles and cruise missiles available to them."" Though the Russian military has expended a lot of the missile inventory readied for operations in Ukraine the official noted that ""they still have an awful lot left."" The official said that Russia's military is ""running the lowest on our air launched cruise missiles"" but that they still have ""over 50% of what they had assembled prior to the invasion. But they still have a significant number of ground launched cruise missiles, short range ballistic missiles, and medium range ballistic missiles.",14,,,,1
2022-03-23,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/us-formally-accuses-russian-forces-committing-war-crimes/story?id=83627208,US formally accuses Russian forces of committing war crimes in Ukraine,"Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Wednesday announced that the State Department has made a formal assessment that Russian forces have committed war crimes in Ukraine. ""Based on information currently available, the U.S. government assesses that members of Russia's forces have committed war crimes in Ukraine. Our assessment is based on a careful review of available information from public and intelligence sources,"" Blinken said in a statement. The assessment does not come with any new U.S. sanctions, but it backs a global push for accountability for Russia's artillery and airstrikes on civilians and civilian infrastructure. President Joe Biden has said he believes Russian leader Vladimir Putin is a ""war criminal,"" an accusation that the Russian government said threatened diplomatic relations between the two countries, already strained to their breaking point over Putin's war against Ukraine. But whether the war crimes assessment means Putin himself is a war criminal will depend on an individual court of law, according to U.S. Ambassador-at-Large for Global Criminal Justice Beth Van Schaack. ""There are doctrines under international law and domestic law that are able to reach all the way up the chain of command,"" she told reporters Wednesday, but whether that includes the Russian leader ""would depend on a court that has jurisdiction,"" she said. Van Schaack wouldn't say how the U.S. will push for accountability for what it has now deemed war crimes, adding, ""Everything's on the table. We're considering all the various options for accountability."" That includes the International Criminal Court, which has opened an investigation into potential war crimes, and domestic courts, including in neighboring countries who may gain custody of Russian service members or conduct trials in absentia. But the U.S. legal system is ill-equipped to handle cases, Van Schaack said, because the U.S. War Crimes Act limits prosecutions to U.S. citizens who are perpetrators or victims. Congress is considering amending that law, she said. Because the U.S. is not a party to the ICC, she said they have no ""affirmative cooperation duties,"" but left open the possibility for cooperating with it. Russia and Ukraine are also not parties to the ICC, but Ukraine reached an agreement with the court to grant it jurisdiction to investigate potential war crimes dating back to Russia's first invasion in 2014 when it seized the Crimean Peninsula and sparked the separatist war in eastern provinces known as the Donbas. Van Schaack declined to speak to individual attacks that backed up the new U.S. assessment, but she and Blinken pointed to Russia directly targeting sites that were clearly marked for civilian use. ""Russia's forces have destroyed apartment buildings, schools, hospitals, critical infrastructure, civilian vehicles, shopping centers, and ambulances, leaving thousands of innocent civilians killed or wounded. Many of the sites Russia's forces have hit have been clearly identifiable as in-use by civilians,"" Blinken said in his statement. This includes the Mariupol maternity hospital and ""a strike that hit a Mariupol theater, clearly marked with the word 'дети' -- Russian for 'children' -- in huge letters visible from the sky. Putin's forces used these same tactics in Grozny, Chechnya, and Aleppo, Syria, where they intensified their bombardment of cities to break the will of the people,"" Blinken added. Van Schaack said individual Russian service members who conducted these attacks could be prosecuted, but so too could their commanders who were responsible for them and were either complicit in the attacks or even just because they didn't stop their forces from conducting them. The State Department will continue to compile evidence of war crimes and share them with the appropriate bodies, including Ukraine's prosecutor general's office, which has said it's recorded over 2,400 ""crimes of aggression and war crimes"" in the month-long war and identified 127 suspects, prosecutor general Iryna Venediktova told the AFP. That evidence includes not just video, photos, and other publicly available information, but U.S. intelligence, including intercepted communications between Russian service members, according to Van Schaack, who said all of it is being preserved for future trials. ""We don't want to lose that evidence. We don't want that evidence to be tampered with. So it's extremely important that it be collected now and preserved with an eye towards future accountability,"" she told reporters. For weeks, U.S. officials, up to and including Biden, hinted that the U.S. was seeing evidence that Russia was committing war crimes, but deferred to a formal assessment from Van Schack's office, the State Department's office of global criminal justice. Still, Biden told reporters last week he believed Putin is a ""war criminal"" -- a comment that the Russian Foreign Ministry summoned U.S. ambassador John Sullivan over, warning it put U.S.-Russian relations ""on the brink of collapse.""",13,,,,7
2022-03-22,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/us-recognizes-myanmars-atrocities-rohingya-genocide/story?id=83582997,US recognizes Myanmar's atrocities against Rohingya as 'genocide',"The U.S. government has determined the attacks by Myanmar's military against the Rohingya, a Muslim ethnic minority, constituted genocide and crimes against humanity, Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced Monday. The legal determination comes nearly five years after the brutal violence killed approximately 9,000 Rohingya and drove nearly 1 million from the Southeast Asian country across the border into Bangladesh, fleeing murder, rape and arson. Despite calls from Congress, human rights advocates, and other bodies to designate the atrocities a genocide, the State Department had held out. But now, with many of the same military leaders that were responsible for the genocide in power as part of a military coup last year, Blinken said recognizing the genocide was a key part of promoting accountability for its victims. ""The day will come when those responsible for these appalling acts will have to answer for them,"" Blinken said firmly during remarks at the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington. The determination is only the eighth such one made by the State Department in the decades since the Holocaust, including in Bosnia and Rwanda, by ISIS and the Chinese government. It doesn't bring with it any automatic punishment. Instead, Blinken vowed to continue efforts toward accountability, including by announcing $1 million in new funding for the United Nations' Independent Investigative Mechanism for Myanmar. U.N. investigators have already found that the military committed ""genocidal acts,"" but the IIMM is collecting evidence for potential future prosecutions of military commanders involved in atrocities, just as investigations continue at the International Criminal Court and elsewhere. The U.N.'s top court, the International Court of Justice, also ruled in January 2020 that Myanmar must ""take all measures within its power"" to prevent the genocide of Rohingya after The Gambia, a small West African country, filed a lawsuit against Myanmar on behalf of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, a coalition of countries with significant Muslim populations. Still, activists and human rights groups say Blinken's historic announcement could help spur action, ahead of the fifth anniversary of the military's deadly campaign this August. ""Rohingya faced genocide, one of the most terrible crimes imaginable, and then faced the international community not even acknowledging it had happened. Today, the U.S. has gone a long way to correcting that,"" said Tun Khin, a Rohingya activist. But Myanmar, still called by its former name, Burma, by the U.S. government, is now led by the military commanders who oversaw and orchestrated the genocide, including Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, the leader who deposed Myanmar's democratically-elected government and its civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi. Myanmar has denied it has committed a genocide, instead calling it a military operation against Islamist extremists. It has rejected the ICJ's findings and refused to cooperate with the ICC probe. The Trump administration stopped short of designating the atrocities a genocide, in part because of concerns that pushing Myanmar's government too strongly would cause a military coup that collapsed the power-sharing civilian-military government. But critics have argued the impunity the military largely faced laid the groundwork for its February 2021 coup, just days after President Joe Biden took office. Trump's first secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, called the attacks ""ethnic cleansing"" and his successor, Mike Pompeo, quietly released a State Department report documenting the atrocities, but declined to speak to its significance. But that report was one ""key"" basis for Blinken's determination, he said Monday. When he took office, he said the department would conduct a new review of the evidence and make a determination. Conducted in 2018, the State Department report documented through interviews with victims of grisly crimes that approximately three-quarters personally witnessed a killing, a majority witnessed sexual violenceand one-fifth witnessed a ""mass casualty event"" in which more than 100 people were killed or injured. Blinken didn't just cite those statistics Monday, he also read the firsthand accounts of some victims, including those documented by the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum's exhibit, ""Burma's Path to Genocide,"" which he toured before his remarks. ""It's painful to even read these accounts, and I ask you -- I ask each and every one of you listening -- put yourself in their place. ... These stories force us to reckon with the immeasurable pain wrought by every heinous abuse. That pain ripples outward -- from the individual victims and survivors to loved ones, to friends, to entire communities,"" he said -- adding a reference to his stepfather Samuel Pisar, a Holocaust survivor and renowned author, who he said ""carried"" that pain ""for the rest of his life."" But despite that pain, Myanmar's military leaders have suffered few consequences for their bloody actions -- not just the genocide, but last year's coup -- according to some activists. Successive rounds of U.S., European Union, British and Canadian sanctions, including on key economic sectors and military-owned enterprises, have not changed their course, especially amid continued support from Russia and China. ""Stronger actions must be followed to punish perpetrators, to protect remaining Rohingya in Myanmar, rebuild our lives,"" Wai Wai Nu, a Rohingya activist, tweeted Monday. Since the coup, the military has widened its attacks on civilians across the country and on other ethnic minority groups, while the same systems of persecution and violence that repressively targeted Rohingya for decades and presaged the genocide remain in place. ""We urge the administration, and the international community, to continue to do more to hold the military junta accountable, redouble efforts to restore democracy and bring about a genuine national reconciliation to Burma,"" said Sen. Bob Menendez, D-N.J., and James Risch, R-Idaho, the chair and ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. But that kind of reconciliation seems increasingly out of reach. Over a year after the coup, the armed forces have killed more than 1,600 people and detained thousands more. An opposition ""National Unity Government"" has received some backing from the U.S., but the country is heading toward a protracted civil war with increasingly dangerous implications for Myanmar and the region, according to some analysts.",13,,,,23
2022-03-22,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/fbi-concerned-russian-cyberattacks-critical-us-infrastructure-wray/story?id=83604956,FBI 'concerned' about Russian cyberattacks on critical US infrastructure: Wray,"FBI Director Christopher Wray said Tuesday the FBI is ""concerned' with the possibility of Russian cyberattacks against critical U.S. infrastructure in the wake of Russia's war with Ukraine. ""The reason we're concerned about it is not just based on our longstanding understanding of how the Russians operate, but it's actually the product of specific investigative work and surveillance work that we've been doing all together,"" Wray told an audience at the Detroit Economic Club. ""Most cyberattacks don't just happen in an instant. There's activity that leads up to it. There's scanning and researching, researching a victim, scanning for vulnerabilities and systems. There's developing access to those systems. So, there's a whole range of preparatory work, which is what we've been seeing,"" he said. It comes as the FBI has seen five U.S. energy companies have their systems scanned, according to a source familiar with the situation, outlined in an agency bulletin first reported by CBS News. ABC News has confirmed the bulletin's contents. ""Today, with the ongoing conflict raging in Ukraine, we're particularly focused on the destructive cyber threat posed by the Russian intel services, and cybercriminal groups they protect and support,"" Wray said in prepared remarks. ""We have cyber personnel working closely with the Ukrainians and our other allies abroad, and with the private sector and our partners here."" On Monday, President Joe Biden urged American businesses to shore up their cyber defenses, saying the threat of a cyberattack on the U.S. has grown now that Russian President Vladimir Putin has his ""back against the wall."" ""I have previously warned about the potential that Russia could conduct malicious cyber activity against the United States, including as a response to the unprecedented economic costs we've imposed on Russia alongside our allies and partners,"" Biden said in a statement. ""It's part of Russia's playbook. Today, my Administration is reiterating those warnings based on evolving intelligence that the Russian Government is exploring options for potential cyberattacks."" Echoing his comments was the deputy national security adviser for Cyber and Emerging Technology Anne Neuburger at Monday's White House press briefing. She did not go into details about what exactly officials are seeing, but stressed to reporters the government has stepped up preparations for a cyber attack. ""Just last week, federal agencies convened in more than 100 companies to share new cybersecurity threat information, in light of this evolving threat intelligence. During those meetings, we shared resources and tools to help companies harden their security. Like advisory sourced from sensitive threat intelligence and hands on support from local FBI field offices, and sister regional offices, including their shields up program,"" Neuberger said. Neuberger said there was not evidence of a specific cyberattack, but ""some preparatory activity"" that prompted the White House to give classified briefings to companies in sectors they thought could be impacted -- without detailing what sectors that included, despite being pressed for more specifics several times during the briefing. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency Director Jenn Easterly both said DHS has resources to combat cyberattacks for private businesses and urged companies to protect themselves. ""Organizations of every size and across every sector should continue enhancing their cybersecurity defenses,"" Mayorkas said. Last week, Mayorkas was asked about the threat of ransomware attacks as the conflict in Ukraine continues. He said in 2021 there was a 300% increase in the number of ransomware attacks from 2020 -- with ransomware losses totally close to $300 million. He urged companies to sure up their cyber defenses, especially while the conflict continues. ""Some of those measures are so simple and accessible. changing one's password making one's password strong multi factor authentication, backing up one system, there are elementary steps that one can take,"" he told reporters Thursday. ""We have been leaning so far forward in communicating with the private sector, which owns the vast majority of critical infrastructure to equip them to prevent a threat from materializing, to respond swiftly and effectively to an attack should it [occur], and to prove resilient in contemporaneous with the Russian attack and the real possibility that Russia might seek to retaliate via a cyber channel."" As a result of major cyber-attacks in 2021, the Biden administration has tightened cyberattack reporting regulations for certain portions of critical infrastructure, such as pipelines and airlines. Industry and experts are taking this warning from the White House seriously. ""While Russia has not yet launched more aggressive or destructive cyber-attacks that have impaired critical infrastructure or deleted sensitive data in Ukraine or elsewhere, the administration's comments suggest recent intelligence indicates Russian cyber operators are conducting digital reconnaissance or electronically probing electronic systems in the United States that could lead to those types of operations,"" Javed Ali, the former senior counterterrorism Director at the National Security Council told ABC News. ""These public statements that seem to give clues about Russian cyber threats and other military developments from different intelligence sources and methods are part of the Biden administration's overall strategy to put pressure on Putin and demonstrate that the United States and its partners have advance notice of Russia's intentions,"" he said. Critical infrastructure companies are monitoring the threat, including the Tennessee Valley Authority, a company that provides electricity for 153 local power companies in Tennessee and surrounding states. ""TVA continually monitors for ever-changing threats to cybersecurity,"" a company spokesperson told ABC News. ""We use a multi-layer security strategy, including a combination of hardware, software and procedural controls, to secure our critical generation, transmission and business infrastructure systems. TVA's cybersecurity team monitors the entire enterprise 24/7 and coordinates with federal security agencies to rapidly implement new protective measures for targeted cybersecurity issues.""",3,,,,6
2022-03-22,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/pentagon-demurs-biden-confirms-russia-fired-hypersonic-missile/story?id=83587994,"After Pentagon demurs, Biden confirms Russia fired hypersonic missile: Ukraine Day 26","The Pentagon has been providing daily updates on the Russian invasion of Ukraine and Ukraine's efforts to resist. Here are highlights of what a senior U.S. defense official told reporters Monday on Day 26: Russia uses hypersonic missile against Ukraine: Biden President Joe Biden confirmed Monday night that Russia has used a hypersonic missile in Ukraine, saying it’s “the only thing that they can get through with absolute certainty.” ""It doesn't make that much difference, except it's almost impossible to stop it. There's a reason they’re using it,"" Biden said at the Business Roundtable’s CEO Quarterly Meeting in Washington, D.C. Earlier on Monday, a senior U.S. defense official could not confirm Russia's claims to have used hypersonic missiles in Ukraine, but said it's not clear why it would. ""It's a bit of a head-scratcher to be honest with you, because it's not exactly clear why, if it's true, would you need a hypersonic missile fired from not that far away to hit a building?"" the official said. One of the major advantages of hypersonic weapons is the ability to evade radar detection from distant targets. But for hitting nearby Ukraine, the advantages are less obvious. One reason Russia might have used such a weapon could be due to running low on precision-guided munitions, or to send a message to the West and Ukraine in order to gain leverage in negotiations, the defense official said, adding that it is not practical from a purely military perspective. No Russian progress on the ground Russian forces are no closer to Kyiv than they were more than a week ago, the official said. ""They haven't achieved anything in terms of what we assessed to be their objectives, which was population centers so that they could occupy and take over Ukraine,"" the official said. The official added that you can count ""on one hand"" the cities Russian forces have taken, noting that Donetsk and Luhansk were already under their control before the invasion. ""So what have they gained in now 26 days? They got Melitopol, they got Berdyansk, and they got Kherson. That's it. They don't have Kharkiv, they don't have Mariupol,"" the official said. Ukrainian forces even mounted a counter-attack to try to retake Kherson, according to the official. ""It's very clear that the Ukrainians are showing no signs of stopping the resistance and no signs of slowing down their attacks on the Russians,"" the official said. The official said most credit for the stalled Russian efforts goes to the Ukrainian forces and citizens, and the leadership of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. ""President Zelenskyy has been quite inspirational, as you've all seen, and has really motivated his forces and his citizens, because some average citizens are picking up arms and fighting,"" the official said. But weapons and training from the U.S. and others are also playing a major role. ""It's not just about pointing and shooting,"" the official said. ""They're able to be nimble and creative because they were so well trained over the last eight years."" Despite setbacks, Russian forces have most of their forces intact and are trying to overcome. ""They are looking for a chance to gain some momentum -- not even regain momentum ... because they never really had it. And that's what's so frustrating for them,"" the official said. The frustrated Russian ground effort is leading to more missile strikes and artillery bombardment on cities, which makes things ever more dangerous for civilians, according to the official. ""This is not a military known for precision,"" the official said of the invaders. Pentagon press secretary John Kirby told reporters Monday the Pentagon believes Russia is in some cases deliberately targeting civilians. “We certainly see clear evidence that Russian forces are committing war crimes,"" Kirby said. ""And we are helping with the collecting of evidence of that. But there's investigative processes that are going to go on and we're gonna let that happen. We're going to contribute to that investigative process.” Failure to launch The U.S. assesses Russia has fired more than 1,100 missiles against Ukraine since the beginning of the invasion. And there are indications it is having ""inventory issues"" with its precision-guided munitions, which could be one reason we're seeing greater use of unguided ""dumb bombs,"" the official said. The official added that Russia still has the majority of its missile stocks available. But the Pentagon is also seeing problems with the reliability of Russia's precision weapons. Some Russian missiles are ""failing to launch, or they're failing to hit the target, or they're failing to explode on contact,"" the official said. More Russian naval action near Odessa While there is still no sign of an imminent amphibious assault, the U.S. has seen more naval activity in the northern Black Sea, where Russia has more than a dozen surface warships of varying types. ""Clearly they're using surface combatants for shelling purposes, and for the long-range fires in and around Odessa,"" the official said. ""Whether this is a prelude to an amphibious assault is not clear."" Russian combat power Russia's invading force has ""just below"" 90% of its combat power intact, according to the official. ""We recognize that they are taking casualties every day. They are losing aircraft, they are losing armor and vehicles -- there's no doubt about that. Tanks, APCs, artillery units, helicopters, fixed wing jets,"" the official said. As for Ukraine, the Pentagon assesses it still has more than 90% of its combat power intact. The official credits this to the constant arms replenishment coming in from the U.S. and others. Also keep in mind that while this estimated percentage is slightly higher for Ukraine than Russia, Russia has more total power to lose. So far, the U.S. hasn't seen any movement of additional Russian troops to Ukraine. Russia lacks small-unit leadership The official could not confirm Ukrainian claims to have killed six Russian generals, but said it makes sense that there would be senior officers on the ground with the invading force. First, this is a major operation for the Russian military Second, ""they don't organize their military the way we do, they don't have an equivalent to a noncommissioned officer corps. And their junior officers don't have the same wherewithal, flexibility -- they don't invest in their junior officers the kind of initiative that we do,"" the official said. While the U.S. military instills a sense of battlefield leadership starting at the junior NCO ranks (corporals and sergeants on up), the Russian military has no such ethos, according to the official. ""The fact that there might be senior leaders on the field perhaps involved at a more tactical level than we would have a two star or a one star, it's apples to oranges in terms of how they organize themselves and how they lead,"" the official said, adding that Russian forces seem to be having command-and-control problems. $800 million weapons package from US shipping soon Initial shipments of the new $800 million U.S. weapons package to Ukraine will arrive ""very, very soon,"" the official said. This package includes thousands of shoulder-fired anti-armor/air systems, small arms, and 100 small Switchblade drone systems. The Pentagon has not seen any attempts by Russia to hit incoming weapon shipments so far. ABC News' Justin Gomez and Luis Martinez contributed to this report.",14,,,,1
2022-03-18,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/International/lviv-ukraine-hit-missiles-1st-time-russian-invasion/story?id=83526019,"Lviv, Ukraine, hit with missiles for 1st time since Russian invasion","Russian missile strikes hit the western Ukrainian city of Lviv Friday around 6:30 a.m. local time, marking the first strike on the city since the invasion began. The missiles hit the area near Lviv's airport, about 4 miles from the city center, according to the mayor of Lviv, Andriy Sadovyi. No casualties were reported after the attack, according to Sadovyi. Lviv is about 50 miles from the border with Poland. An aircraft repair plant was hit and destroyed and windows in the buildings of the communal transport enterprise were damaged in the strike, Sadovyi said. Six missiles, likely X-555, were fired from the Black Sea, according to preliminary data from the Ukraine's western military command. Two of the missiles were destroyed by anti-aircraft missile troops, command said. In an address Friday, Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the country's air force is ""not enough to ensure safety."" ""Russian forces continue to bomb and shell our cities -- from Lviv to Kyiv, from Kharkiv to Chernihiv, Sumy, Zhytomyr, cities of Donbas especially Mariupol. They fire missiles, drop bombs and launch GRADs. We try to intercept and shoot down whatever we can: aircraft, helicopters and missiles although we don't yet possess the adequate anti-missile weapons, modern systems,"" Zelenskyy said. He added that his appeals for weapons will be ""more forceful."" ""We'll remind those leaders that they will suffer moral defeat if they don't provide us with adequate and modern weapons promised to us, weapons that could quite literally save thousands upon thousands of Ukrainian lives. Russian missiles will not be shot down by age-old rifles that certain parties try to supply to us instead of modern equipment,"" Zelenskyy said. A senior U.S. official told ABC News Thursday that Russians have been using more long range systems, mobile systems repositioned from inside Russia to the border, but on the Russian side. There is apparently concern if they move across the border, guerilla fighters will intercept them.",17,,,,1
2022-03-15,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/International/civilians-war-amid-ukraine-conflict/story?id=83178098,What to know about civilians in war amid Ukraine conflict,"In the Ukraine conflict, reports of civilian casualties have dominated the headlines as Russian troops siege cities around the country. Civilian buildings have been hit by Russian forces, with hospitals and residential buildings shelled, causing thousands of civilian casualties and massive human suffering. Russia has denied they are deliberately targeting civilians and insisted in some cases that enemy fighters were hiding within the buildings. Russia is also reported to have used unguided ""dumb"" bombs in Ukraine, which greatly increase the risk of missing targets and hitting civilian infrastructure. Many countries, including the United States, along with independent monitors, like Amnesty International, have condemned Russia's actions. ""We've all seen the devastating images coming out of Ukraine and are appalled by Russia's brutal tactics,"" White House deputy press secretary Andrew Bates said Friday. ""Pregnant women on stretchers, apartment buildings -- buildings shelled, families killed while seeking safety from this terrible violence. These are disgusting attacks; civilian casualties are increasing. If Russia is intentionally targeting civilians, that would be a war crime."" But whether or not these attacks constitute war crimes has been debated. U.S. officials and the United Nations have been more reserved, saying legal assessments must be done, but Ukrainian officials have clearly condemned Russia's attacks as violations of international humanitarian law. Making matters murkier is the issue of civilians taking up arms to resist the Russian advance and the fact that the front lines often disappear in the realm of urban warfare. Here's what you need to know about the laws of war pertaining to civilians: Civilians off limits, except when they take up arms In an armed conflict, countries are not allowed to deliberately target or indiscriminately attack civilians, the civilian population or civilian properties, according to the rules of international humanitarian law, or IHL. IHL covers the rules of war, specifying what parties can and can't do during an armed conflict. The Geneva Conventions, four treaties adopted in 1949 and signed by 196 countries, are the core of IHL, according to the humanitarian organization International Committee of the Red Cross. Additional protocols were later adopted in 1977 and 2005. The conventions and protocols regulate the conduct of armed conflict and seek to minimize its effects. Russia signed Protocol 1 in 1977, but Russian leader Vladimir Putin revoked Russia's acceptance in October 2019, citing potential abuse of a commission set up to investigate war crimes. But the protections for civilians who participate in an armed conflict by taking up arms are different, Allen Weiner, the director of the Stanford Program in International and Comparative Law, told ABC News. ""The rule is that civilians can be targeted, but only for such time as they are directly taking part in hostilities. So while a civilian is shooting at you, they become a permissible target. When they go back home, they cease to be permissible target under the law of armed conflict,"" Weiner said. Principles of distinction, proportionality, precautions Under the Geneva Conventions, signatory states must abide by the IHL principles of distinction, proportionality and precautions during an armed conflict. Distinction requires all sides to distinguish between civilian populations and combatants at all times, including distinguishing between civilian and military infrastructures, according to the ICRC. This distinction is important, as the rules of war forbid countries from launching attacks on civilians and civilian objects or even launching indiscriminate attacks that hit military targets and civilians or civilian objects without distinction. ""Essential infrastructure must be spared, including water, gas and electrical systems that, for instance, provide civilian homes, schools and medical facilities with vital water and electricity supplies,"" the ICRC told ABC News. Russia, for instance, has captured the Chernobyl and Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plants and attacked at least 26 health care facilities, the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, or OHCHR, last week. Russia has also hit other gas and electric infrastructure. ""There's not really different tiers of immunity; civilian objects are immune, period. So a civilian house is immune, a school is immune and a hospital is immune. And there's really only one degree of immunity, which is, it can't be targeted,"" Weiner said. The ICRC said that the use of ""weapons with wide area effects must be avoided in populated areas"" and that ""attacks carried out with new technologies and cyber means must also respect international humanitarian law."" The Russian army has been accused of using cluster bombs by Ukraine, including at Central City Hospital in Vuhledar on Feb. 24, reports the Office of the OHCHR called ""credible."" Proportionality prohibits states from launching attacks against military targets if the attack is expected to cause incidental loss of civilian life, injury to civilians or damage to civilian objects. Attacks may only be launched against a military objective if the potential civilian losses are not expected to outweigh the foreseen military advantage, according to the ICRC. Parties to a conflict must ""at all times take action to minimize civilian harm,"" Cordula Droege, the chief legal officer for the ICRC, told ABC News in an interview. In a conflict, countries are required to take constant precautions to spare civilians and their objects, which includes doing everything possible to verify that targets are military objects and giving advance warning of attacks that may affect the civilian population when possible, according to the ICRC. ""Civilians should be spared,"" Droege said. Consequences There are consequences for breaking the rules of war. War crimes are documented and investigated by governments and international courts, such as the International Criminal Court. Individuals can also be prosecuted for war crimes, according to the ICRC. Russia has been accused of targeting civilians and civilian infrastructures during its invasion of Ukraine, which is considered illegal under international law. Russia has denied the accusations and in some cases claimed enemy fighters were hiding behind civilians and in civilian buildings. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken accused Russia of hitting civilian targets in Ukraine, killing innocent people and destroying hospitals, schools and critical infrastructure such as running water, electricity and gas, all of which is protected under international law. But while the U.S. has said it is documenting the incidents, officials have stopped short of saying Russia is guilty of war crimes. ""States are obligated to prosecute people who commit these crimes. ... If the Russians are doing it, they have a legal obligation to prosecute their own,"" Weiner said. ""A lot of militaries do actually prosecute their own people if they violate the rules."" The ICRC is ""extremely worried about the protection of civilians"" in Ukraine, Droege said. ""We are engaging all parties to the conflict on a bilateral and confidential dialogue to ensure they abide by their [IHL] obligations, including the respect of civilian objects, such as essential infrastructure, and, more broadly, all other IHL rules on the conduct of hostilities,"" the ICRC said. Even though Ukraine did not sign on to be a party to the International Criminal Court, it issued a declaration recognizing the jurisdiction of the court in 2015 -- a year and a half after Russian forces first invaded Ukraine, seizing the Crimean Peninsula and launching a separatist war in the eastern provinces Donetsk and Luhansk. That declaration gives the ICC the ability to prosecute criminal cases in the country, while the Ukrainian government has also said it is collecting evidence to be able to prosecute Russian service members they capture who have violated IHL. Theoretically, Weiner said, there could be a prosecution of Russian soldiers or even Russia civilians in command of the army, such as the head of state or minister of defense, in the case of ""ordering or directing these violations of international humanitarian law."" While Weiner said the evidence gathered will show what, if any, violations of international humanitarian law have occurred, one thing is clear to him. ""This is really unusual in terms of being one of the most flagrant violations that I have seen of the basic idea that one country can't simply invade another and try to take its territory by force, or to replace its government,"" Weiner said.",13,,,,7

She was captured in a powerful photo taken by an Associated Press photographer after a Russian airstrike destroyed the hospital. She was carried out from the rubble of the hospital on a stretcher. In the now internationally known photo, the woman can be seen covered in dust, holding her lower abdomen as she was carried through the wreckage. She died after medics at a nearby hospital attempted to save her and her baby's life. Her name is not yet known, according to the Associated Press, as her body was taken by her husband and father. According to reporter Asya Dolina from Voice of America, AP photographer Evgeny Maloletka, who took the photos of the woman, also confirmed her death. Another pregnant woman evacuated from the wreckage, Marianna Podgurskaya, gave birth to a girl Sunday, Dolina said Ukrainian officials said the attack initially killed at least three people, including a child, and wounded at least 17 people. Mariupol deputy mayor Sergei Orlov said that at least 1,207 people have died in the city because of shelling and aerial attacks since the Russian invasion began. Half of those killed were ethnic Russians. Among the casualties was a child who died from dehydration, according to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Zelenskyy had posted a video on social media last Wednesday, which he said showed the heavily damaged children's hospital and maternity ward in the southeastern Ukrainian port city. ""Direct strike of Russian troops at the maternity hospital,"" he said, calling on the international community again to impose a ""no-fly"" zone over Ukraine. ""People, children are under the wreckage. Atrocity! How much longer will the world be an accomplice ignoring terror?""

2022-03-11,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/russia-escalates-false-chemical-weapons-claims-us-ukraine/story?id=83366504,"Russia escalates false chemical weapons claims about US, Ukraine by bringing them to UN","Russia is doubling down on its false claims that the U.S. and Ukraine are developing chemical or biological weapons for use against invading Russian forces, bringing the accusation to the United Nations Security Council on Friday. A web of disinformation, not only from Russian state media but also Chinese propaganda outlets and even some American voices, have increasingly spread the conspiracy theory this week. That's prompted heightened concern among U.S. and Ukrainian officials that Russia itself may be planning to deploy chemical or biological weapons against Ukrainian targets or as part of a so-called ""false flag"" operation. ""This makes me really worried because we've been repeatedly convinced if you want to know Russia's plans, look at what Russia accuses others of,"" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in a televised address late Thursday, a sentiment the White House first shared Wednesday. Ukraine does not have biochemical weapons laboratories. Instead, there are public health and veterinary health labs operated with U.S. support in Ukraine and several other former Soviet countries that provide technical support to a government's health ministry and study disease, like the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. U.S. support originated with the Cooperative Threat Reduction program, launched in 1991 to help secure and dismantle the remnants of the former Soviet Union's biochemical weapons program in newly independent states, including Ukraine. The U.S. has talked openly about the program throughout its history, working with 26 facilities in Ukraine on issues like biosafety and scientific mentorship training, according to the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists, an independent nonprofit dedicated to science and global security. But in recent years, Russia, as well as China, has escalated accusations that these labs constitute a secret U.S. biochemical weapons program, at one point even claiming in state-run media outlets that they created the COVID-19 pandemic. In bitter irony, these labs have helped detect and stop the spread of COVID-19, according to public health officials. Those false claims have skyrocketed this week, with Russian now bringing them to one of the world's brightest spotlights -- the U.N. Security Council. Russia's mission in New York called for an emergency meeting Friday, 24 hours after its defense ministry falsely claimed it uncovered ""U.S. secret military biological projects in Ukraine,"" per state-run media. ""We're not going to let Russia get away with gaslighting the world or using the U.N. Security Council as a venue for promoting their disinformation,"" Olivia Dalton, the spokesperson for the U.S. mission to the U.N., told ABC News Thursday. It's unclear if the U.S. will try to stop the meeting, currently scheduled for 10 a.m. ET. Procedural matters, like holding a meeting, require nine of the chamber's 15 envoys to vote in favor, and no country can veto a meeting being held. While the false claims have escalated this week, Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu ranted back in December that Ukraine, with U.S. mercenary help, was preparing a chemical weapons attack. In 2018, Russia also made similar accusations against Georgia, the small former Soviet state that the Kremlin invaded a decade earlier as its government, like Ukraine's, sought NATO membership. Russian forces still occupy two regions of the country, recognizing them as independent states -- just as it did last month in eastern Ukraine before launching its invasion. ""The Russian allegations appear to be part of a disinformation campaign that has grown in response to scrutiny of Moscow for using and enabling the use of chemical weapons,"" the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists reported in 2018 when Russia's claims about Georgia were proven false. The Kremlin record of ""using and enabling the use of chemical weapons"" runs deep, according to the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists, especially against individuals deemed enemies. No one is higher on that list right now than Alexey Navalny. The opposition leader and anti-corruption activist was poisoned in August 2020 with the nerve agent Novichok by agents from the FSB, Russia's principal security agency. He was flown to Germany and recovered before returning in January 2021 to Moscow, where he was almost immediately arrested. Another notable example before Navalny were the Skripals. Sergei Skripal, a former Russian officer who was a double agent for the United Kingdom, was also poisoned with Novichok in March 2018 in Salisbury, England. His daughter Yulia and a police officer were also hospitalized by the attack, but all three recovered. In contrast, Ukraine has been in full compliance with the chemical and biological weapons conventions since signing them in 1972 and 1993, respectively, according to the State Department. Asked about Ukraine's biomedical facilities, CIA Director Bill Burns told the Senate Thursday, ""In any public health system around the world, there's going to be work done in the interests of wider public health, to ensure that we have a grip on issues like that. But that's in no way threatening. That's not something that can be weaponized in the way that the Russians have clearly demonstrated -- by their own actions against their citizens and people outside their country -- their willingness to use."" It's unclear whether U.S. intelligence has any evidence that Russian forces are preparing for a chemical or biological attack. The White House, State Department and Pentagon publicly pointed only to ""Moscow's track record"" and ""increasingly concerning rhetoric,"" in the words of State Department spokesperson Ned Price. But a senior Pentagon official told reporters, ""We have picked up indications that the Russians could be making these claims -- these false claims -- about us and Ukrainian work in bio defense as a way of creating a pretext of their own, to perhaps use these kinds of agents in an attack."" Pressed on what ""indications"" they were referring to, they added, ""I have to leave it with you with indications, and [I'm] not going to be at liberty to go in more detail than that today."" For those in Ukraine, where Russian forces have shown there's little they won't do to subjugate the country, the fear is real. ""The manic obsession with which various Russian officials fantasize about non-existent biological or chemical weapons or hazards in Ukraine is deeply troubling and may actually point at Russia preparing another horrific false flag operation. This tweet is for the record,"" Ukrainian Foreign Ministry Dmytro Kuleba tweeted Thursday. ABC News' Luis Martinez contributed to this report from the Pentagon.",3,,,,5

Russia's foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova claimed during a daily briefing Wednesday that Ukraine had put firing positions inside the children's hospital in Mariupol, though there is currently no evidence to support that allegation. The comment, however, appears to be an implicit acknowledgment that Russia deliberately targeted the hospital, as Kirilenko had claimed. UNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell said she was ""horrified"" by the reported attack on the hospital. ""We do not yet know the number of casualties but fear the worst,"" she said in a statement. ""This attack, if confirmed, underscores the horrific toll this war is exacting on Ukraine's children and families. In less than two weeks, at least 37 children have been killed and 50 injured, while more than 1 million children have fled Ukraine to neighboring countries."" The besieged city, which sits on the Sea of Azov, has been without power or water amid steady Russian bombardments.

Orlov reported that 1,207 people have died in the city because of shelling and aerial attacks -- and that half of those killed were ethnic Russians.

New satellite imagery collected by commercial satellite company Maxar Technologies on Wednesday morning, before the reported shelling of the hospital, showed extensive damage to civilian infrastructure in and around the city, including residential homes, high-rise apartment buildings, grocery stores and shopping centers. Orlov accused Russia of indiscriminately bombarding the city because its forces were unable to break through its defenses, but he said that Mariupol would not surrender. He also called on the international community to impose a no-fly zone, an escalation that the White House and NATO allies have opposed. ""The Russian army cannot break our defenses and win on the ground, and this is why they are just bombing us relentlessly to break our spirit,"" he said. ""Our spirit is strong but we need help.

Now, 227 miles below the unrivaled laboratory, Russia has waged a war in Ukraine that's pitted the country against the U.S. and its allies -- leaving the future of the ISS in question. ""When you're in space and you're flying around the Earth at 17,500 miles an hour and in a very hazardous environment, cooperation is the most important thing,"" said former astronaut Scott Kelly. The ISS is divided into two sections: the Russian Orbital Segment operated by Russia and the United States Orbital Segment run by the U.S. American and Russian astronauts were the first to step inside the ISS in 1998. Watch the full story on ""ABCNL Prime"" TONIGHT at 9 p.m. ET on ABC. From there, the partnership has continued. When the U.S. shuttle program ended in 2011, U.S. astronauts like Cady Coleman relied exclusively on Russian rockets to get her on board the station. Coleman said once on board the craft, where you came from didn't matter, and it was all about how to work and live with one another. ""Space is hard and space is dangerous. And in my experience ... with our Russian partners it means sitting down, having a meal together,"" said Coleman. ""It means talking about what's hard for you, what's hard for them and how together we can get this accomplished. [We] look each other in the eye and realize that we're all about the same thing."" Coleman said that American astronauts and Russian cosmonauts would cooperate on everything from life-or-death missions to the mundane. ""I was up there with the three Russian cosmonauts,"" said Coleman.""[We] share a goal of exploring space ... and that goal doesn't change whether we're on the Earth or living up on the space station."" NASA's reliance on Russian rockets ended in 2020 when SpaceX debuted its Crew Dragon Capsule, but talks are underway to allow Russians on future SpaceX flights. Russian cosmonauts continue to train at NASA's facility in Houston. Astronaut Mark Vande Hei, who holds the ongoing record for longest space flight, is set to end his 355 days in space in just three weeks. The plan is for him to land in Kazakhstan with two Russian cosmonauts on a Russian spacecraft. But unprecedented sanctions against Russia could put Vande Hei's return on hold. After Russia invaded Ukraine nearly two weeks ago, President Joe Biden announced new sanctions, including cutting more than half of Russia's high-tech imports. ""It'll degrade their aerospace industry, including their space program,"" Biden said during a White House address Feb. 24. Shortly after the remarks, NASA released a statement on U.S.-Russian civil space cooperation, saying that ""no changes are planned"" and that the agency will continue to support ""ongoing in orbit and ground station operations."" Dmitry Rogozin, the head of Russia's Space Agency and a close ally to Russian President Vladimir Putin, responded to Biden in a series of hostile tweets. On Feb. 26, he posted a video in Russian that threatened to leave Vande Hei behind in space and detach Russia's segment of the space station altogether. Kelly said he felt compelled to speak up and engaged with Rogozin on Twitter. ""I was just enraged that he, the [cosmonauts], said that they were going to leave an American crew member behind. I never thought I would ever hear anything so outrageous,"" said Kelly. NASA has remained silent on Rogozin's threats to abandon Vande Hei in space. Prior to the conflict in Ukraine, Russia had announced plans to pull out of the space station as early as 2025. Although war continues to wage on Earth, Kelly said he hopes that the U.S.-Russian partnership in space can be mended. ""I've known [people at the Russian Space Agency], many of them for well over two decades, I trust them. I've literally trusted them with my life before,"" said Kelly, who added that the U.S. should still ""prepare for the worst"" and ""hope for the best."" Kelly said the ISS is an example of where peace is possible because all astronauts share a common goal: to explore and learn. ""I just hope people realize and want to keep this partnership together because it is one of the few things that unites all of humanity together,"" said Kelly. ""I think one of the biggest successes of the International Space Station is the international aspect of giving us something to work on together, that makes us friends.""",3,,,,9

Here are highlights of what a senior U.S. defense official told reporters on Tuesday: Russian forces mostly still intact Nearly all Russian forces arrayed at the Ukrainian border for the invasion have now gone in, according to the official. Despite losing troops, ground vehicles and aircraft in the fighting, the official estimated these forces remain roughly 95% intact. Russian ground efforts stalled in the north Russian troops approaching Kyiv have made little progress in recent days, according to the official. ""We continue to see Ukrainian resistance efforts slow down the Russians, particularly in the north,"" the official said. Another factor is that ""they still seem to be plagued by logistics and sustainment challenges,"" including fuel and food shortages, the official said. The Pentagon also continues to see fighting and resistance against the Russian advance in the northern cities of Chernihiv and Kharkiv. The farthest the main Russian force heading to Kyiv seems to have been able to reach is Hostomel Airport, a site of intense combat some 20 miles northwest of the city. But their intent is clear, the official said: ""We still have every reason to assess that their effort is to encircle and force the surrender of Kiev."" A new Russian approach emerges Further out than those advance troops, a Russian push toward the capital is emerging in the northeast, just above the town of Sumy, the official said. These troops are roughly 37 miles from Kyiv. Russians try to ""sow fear and confusion"" in the city While the main invading force has not reached Kyiv, the official was in ""no position to refute"" reports of minor, isolated skirmishes between Russian ""reconnaissance elements"" and Ukrainian forces inside the city. ""We think that these reports of street fighting in Kyiv are really the result of their efforts to sow fear and confusion and and try to set the stage for what could be coming later,"" the official said. Strikes on civilians continue Russian air and missile attacks are increasing as their ground effort has been frustrated, according to the official. ""Whether intentionally or not, they're hitting military and government infrastructure as well as residential areas and civilian targets,"" the official said. Russians see more success in the south Russian troops advancing to the northwest out of Crimea are about 25 miles from Mykolayiv, the official said. The official noted that while there is speculation that the move on Mykolayiv is meant to put troops in position to attack the port city of Odessa from the north as amphibious troops assault from the coast, ""we don't see any evidence of amphibious landings"" at this point. On the Sea of Azov coast, Russian forces have isolated Mariupol and continue to bombard it with long-range attacks. Thousands of troops put ashore in an amphibious landing on the second day of the invasion are approaching the city from the southwest as more troops push down from Donetsk. U.S.-Russia deconfliction line in working order Last week Pentagon press secretary John Kirby announced it had set up a ""deconfliction line"" with Russia to ""reduce the chances of miscalculations and try to bring down the tensions as that contested airspace over Ukraine now bumps up against NATO airspace."" The senior defense official said that as of Tuesday, the two countries have used the line about a dozen times, but so far only for test calls to make sure ""somebody's picking up on the other end."" A problem for any proposed no-fly zone ""Much of the airspace of Ukraine, north and south, is under some umbrella of Russian surface-to-air missile capability,"" the official said.",14,,,,1

Over the past decade, Russian President Vladimir Putin's military has allegedly killed thousands of civilians sheltering in cities across Syria. Putin reportedly used thermobaric weapons in attacks there to save Bashar Assad's regime. The Russian army was accused of killing Syrian civilians between May and July of 2016 with 47 separate cluster munition attacks. The Russian air force also conducted massive airstrikes, allegedly targeting civilians in Hama and Aleppo at schools and hospitals. Allegedly with Russian support, the Assad regime was accused of using chemical weapons in Douma, Syria, on April 7, 2018, reportedly killing between 40 and 50 people, including women and children. Together, the United States, the United Kingdom, and France responded on April 14, 2018, with airstrikes against regime facilities used to manufacture and facilitate the use of chemical weapons. Some experts fear Putin might turn to chemical weapons again, this time to terrorize the Ukrainian people if his military continues to perform poorly. Many believe he views chemical weapons as a legitimate means to fight in urban terrain to penetrate underground shelters, killing combatants and non-combatants alike. As the Russian military continues to fail in its efforts to conquer Ukraine, Ukrainian officials have accused Russia of turning to attacks against the civilian population and the use of weapons like cluster bombs and thermobaric munitions on residential areas. As a result of the Russian military's apparent inadequacies, many expect the targeting of Ukrainian civilians to increase. The International Criminal Court announced it has launched an investigation into allegations of war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide committed in Ukraine by Russia. Everyone in the Russian chain of command carrying out illegal orders to target civilians could be prosecuted under international law. And, if Russian officers can be positively identified, some will seek to publicly name them. If they travel anywhere outside of Russia, every country could be required to detain and deport them to the Hague. If they hide in Russia, no sanctions would be removed until Russia voluntarily sends them to the Hague. Officials across the world will look to consequences for countries and individuals who deliberately target innocent civilians. Targeting civilians is not what soldiers do. It's what war criminals do. At some point, the international community will ask: When do we stop Putin? After 5,000 Ukrainians are killed? 10,000? 100,000? Never? Do we take the risk of escalating the conflict with a nuclear-armed state run by a dictator? Along with severe sanctions, the United States could act to get Russia removed from the United Nations Security Council immediately. Countries could also expel all Russian diplomats, shuttering Russian embassies in the process, while making all of those that keep Putin in power for their benefit isolated by targeting the oligarchs and his inner circle. Putin wants to restore Russian power and prestige. The U.S. and its allies could seek to make it clear he knows that invading a sovereign country is not the path to achieve this; it is a path leading away from it. A key goal would be to ensure that Putin doesn't push his army further westward. NATO would establish a buffer zone dividing Russia from the rest of Europe, patrolled by NATO military aircraft and air defense systems. It would clarify to Putin that an incursion into another country neighboring by Russia will not be permitted. NATO's aim would be to not allow him to build up his forces to invade another country. Military deterrents would be accompanied by expediting the inclusion of Finland, Moldova, and Sweden into NATO if they request to join. President Putin might see that his actions have led to the very circumstances he claimed to be concerned were happening. Putin has already deemed NATO's current sanctions ""akin to a declaration of war."" But NATO could look past Russia's ""manufactured threats,"" choosing to moving forward with the defense of its member nations. NATO could isolate Russia economically, diplomatically, geographically, and double down on military support to the Ukrainians in their effort to save their country.

2022-03-01,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/International/natos-article-pull-us-allies-russia-ukraine-conflict/story?id=83108600,NATO's Article 5 could pull the US and its allies further into the Russia-Ukraine conflict,"President Joe Biden repeatedly has said the United States will not be sending troops to fight Russia in Ukraine, but vowed that the U.S. would defend its NATO allies. ""As I made crystal clear, the United States will defend every inch of NATO territory with the full force of American power,"" he reiterated in an address Thursday. The main goal of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's founding in 1949 was to foster mutual assistance in response to the Soviet Union's expansion in Europe. A key component of the treaty, Article 5, covers ""collective defense,"" which means that an attack on one ally is considered an attack on all allies. Amid the current crisis, Article 5 could mandate a more direct response from the U.S. and other treaty members if Russian aggression escalates beyond Ukraine. NATO announced last week it launched its response force, a deployment of about 40,000 troops to provide land, air and naval assistance across the alliance. This is the first time the force has been deployed for a ""deterrence and defence role,"" a NATO spokesperson said. Charles Kupchan, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations and professor of international affairs at Georgetown University, told ABC News it is possible Article 5 could be invoked while the U.S. and its allies are providing military aid to Ukraine. “Let's say that Russia succeeds in toppling the government. And it then tries to occupy and pacify Ukraine. Assuming that the U.S. and its allies attempt to get arms to a Ukrainian resistance movement, there's a not insignificant risk that Russia might try to interdict that flow. And that whether by design or by accident, an artillery shell or a missile or a bomb could land in Poland or another NATO country,” Kupchan said. “And then we're looking at the prospect of an attack on NATO territory and the potential trigger of the Article Five collective defense guarantee, which then raises the prospect of potential military conflict between NATO and Russia,” Kupchan said. All participating countries agree to the form of solidarity outlined in the article, making it a key component of the alliance. While Ukraine is not a member of NATO, it borders Poland, Hungry, Slovakia and Romania, which are members. Ukraine has been moving toward the West and away from Russia, attempting to join both NATO and the European Union. Kupchan said its geographical location could be strategic during this conflict. “In the current moment, Ukraine's border with four NATO countries affords it two important advantages,” Kupchan said. “One is refugees are able to seek asylum in NATO countries, and we're seeing hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians head west. And the other is that now that Ukraine's airspace is … dominated by Russia, the long border between Ukraine and NATO affords an opportunity to continue to funnel weapons and other sources of support to Ukraine."" The first time Article 5 was invoked was after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. The alliance had already identified terrorism as a risk affecting its security in 1999. In response to the attack, NATO engaged in the fight against terrorism, launching its first operations outside the Euro-Atlantic area to patrol the skies over the U.S. In 2008, NATO appeared to open the door for Ukraine's membership saying it would become a member of the alliance, despite a lack of consensus between members, Kupchan said. NATO did not specify a pathway or timeframe for Ukraine to join the alliance. “In 2008, the Bush administration wanted to proceed with what's called a Membership Action Plan for Ukraine and Georgia. And European partners were reluctant, in part because neither Ukraine nor Georgia was ready to join NATO and because of concern that NATO's enlargement to Georgia and Ukraine would be seen as provocative in Russia,” Kupchan said. “Given the lack of consensus within NATO, the alliance agreed to issue a generic statement that Georgia and Ukraine would become NATO members, but didn’t specify a timeframe or a pathway,” Kupchan said. Russian President Vladimir Putin linked the current crisis to Russia's NATO demands, including a guarantee that NATO will stop expanding to the East, in a video address days before Russia invaded Ukraine. Putin accused the U.S. and NATO of ignoring his demands and blamed the West for the Ukraine crisis. ""[Putin] has said explicitly that he wants to see NATO's military presence [reduced] in the eastern flank and that would include the three Baltic countries, Poland, Romania, Hungary, Slovakia, "" Kupchan said. ""He wants to see NATO pull its capability back."" ""One of the tragic dimensions of this conflict is that the Russians knew full well, that Ukrainian membership in NATO was not under consideration. It was not on the table. And NATO governments were quite explicit about that. Nonetheless, Putin decided to invade the country,"" Kupchan said. Its unlikely Putin would launch an attack on a NATO ally because he would be looking at a ""full-scale war,"" he said. ""My guess is that he understands that this is a non-starter,"" Kupchan said. In addition to NATO's deployment of its response force, it also said it was deploying a quick response brigade of 3,500 troops that could deploy on short notice while the larger unit gathers its troops from various member nations. ""Our measures are and remain preventive, proportionate and non-escalatory,"" a statement from NATO said last week. Kupchan said it is still unclear how far west Russia will go into Ukraine. ""It's conceivable that there could be a rump in Ukraine that Russia does not try to grab hold of and Western Ukraine has generally been much more integrated into Europe, than into Russia,"" Kupchan said.",29,,,,19
2022-02-28,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/International/ukraine-mounting-stiff-resistance-inflicting-painful-casualties-russia/story?id=83145245,"Ukraine mounting stiff resistance, inflicting painful casualties on Russia","KYIV -- There is growing evidence that Ukraine is managing to inflict significant casualties on Russian forces as they try to advance deeper into the country -- and that the swift strike Russia hoped to carry out on the capital, Kyiv, has been slowed by intense and popular resistance. Russia hasn't managed to make significant progress in the last two days. The main Russian force pushing down from Belarus towards Kyiv does not appear to have advanced closer towards the city since coming within about 20 miles, although smaller advanced groups have been fighting gun battles with Ukrainian forces inside the capital since at least Friday. Ukraine's military claims the Russian troops are struggling with fuel and logistics supplies. Images and videos of destroyed Russian military vehicles and tanks, which have been verified, have been circulating online. One example of the effective Ukrainian resistance took place Sunday when Russia appeared to mount a half-hearted attempt to destroy resistance in Ukraine's second city, Kharkiv. Russian special forces units in light armored vehicles tried to push into Kharkiv after indiscriminately bombarding the city with artillery, but they were rapidly destroyed by Ukrainian troops and volunteer territorial defense, according to videos posted online. Kharkiv's Mayor Oleg Sinegubov on Sunday night pushed a triumphant message, saying that ""control over Kharkiv is completely ours"" and that Ukrainian forces had succeeded ""in a full clearing of the city of the enemy."" Sinegubov said dozens of Russian troops had surrendered with little fight, sometimes in whole groups of five to 10 men, with some abandoning their equipment. A number of military analysts -- including those that correctly predicted the invasion -- believed Russia had hoped for a lightning ""shock and awe"" advance to the edge of Kyiv in the first days that would lead to President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's government surrendering without Russia needing to actually seize the city. Instead, the resistance is growing, officials said. ""It is clear they hoped to get Zelenskyy to surrender quickly without inflicting heavy casualties on the Ukrainian military [and] civilians. That failed, but their execution still appears to be fairly restrained,"" Rob Lee, analyst from Kings College London's War Department, wrote on Twitter on Sunday. Lee said that strategy had now failed, and that Russia would have to move to a plan B, which he feared would mean ""more force."" Time is working against Russia. Ukrainian popular resistance is gaining in self-confidence, and the Russian piecemeal strategy so far has allowed cities more time to set up defenses, putting in place barricades and distributing thousands of weapons. In Berdyansk, the only major city Russia has gained full control of, videos posted to social media Monday showed a crowd of residents angrily chanting a slogan insulting President Vladimir Putin at Russian troops guarding a government building on the main square. At the same time, the international response is also growing, with more sanctions and moves aimed at crippling Russia's economy, while European countries are sending more and more weapons to bolster the Ukrainian defense, with the European Union also announcing that for the first time it would provide Ukrainian officials with military support. Russia has so far held back its main army and has been using its air and artillery power against military targets, avoiding widespread, intense bombardment against civilian areas. Analysts, including Lee, said Russia appeared to have initially sought to inflict limited casualties on Ukrainian civilians and the military, likely out of concern about backlash in Russia and making it harder to achieve a swift political change in Ukraine, as well as a stronger international reaction. U.S. officials and independent analyst now fear if Russia's attempt to overpower Ukraine quickly fails, it may turn to using more brute force to achieve it. That could mean unleashing indiscriminate artillery and airstrikes to destroy Ukraine's military and terrorize civilians, as well as besieging cities. That already appears to be happening in Kharkiv, where Russia in the last two days has fired heavy artillery, including ""Grad"" multiple rocket launchers onto the city, causing significant damage to civilian buildings. ""I think today we've seen a shift in Russian targeting towards critical civilian infrastructure, greater use of MLRS, and artillery in suburban areas. Unfortunately, my concern that this was going to get a lot more ugly and affect civilians is starting to materialize,"" Michael Kofman, an analyst at CNA, who also predicted the invasion as likely, tweeted late Saturday. U.S. officials caution, though, that Russia still has major combat power yet to be deployed, with roughly half its forces massed near Ukraine still not engaged. A massive 3-mile-long column of hundreds of vehicles has formed up in northern Ukraine after crossing from Belarus and appears to be moving towards Kyiv.",14,,,,12
2022-02-25,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/International/shields-cyberattack-affect-americans-prepare/story?id=83085211,Shields up: How a possible cyberattack could affect Americans and how to prepare,"As Russia's military continues to strike Ukrainian cities, national security officials are keeping eyes on a different battlefield. Senior U.S. law enforcement and Homeland Security officials have told ABC News that there is growing concern that Russia could launch further cyberattacks against the West. The potential targets include electrical grids, banking systems and mobile networks, according to the officials. Currently, there is no cyber threat to the U.S. homeland, according to the Department of Homeland security. Cybersecurity experts tell ABC News that people shouldn't panic over a potential cyberattack, but they should start preparing for one. ""Freaking out is not a productive thing to do. There are lots of reasons to think that the fact that something is out there but that doesn't mean it could happen,"" Stuart Madnick, the founding director of Cybersecurity at MIT Sloan, told ABC News. ""But there are still a number of things that people can do to stay safe and protected."" Madnick, whose group has consulted with U.S. agencies and private companies such as Nasdaq, said the world is in uncharted territory when it comes to cyber security since this involves alleged cyberattacks by a major superpower. However, what has transpired so far is similar to previous cyber security incidents, he said. There are two types of cyberattacks, he said: ones that have an indirect impact on people's livelihood and attacks targeting the tech of specific people. The biggest indirect hacking examples in the past have targeted key infrastructure points such as the Colonial Pipeline ransomware attack in May 2021, which affected everything from gas prices to flights. ""In the last two years, we've been seeing more of these attacks around the world,"" Madnick said. ""You need to realize how many of our systems are connected to computers and just one hack can have bigger effects."" U.S. and international officials have accused the Russian government of committing cyber attacks that targeted Ukraine's banks in recent weeks. On Friday, Ukrainian officials warned of a phishing scheme emanating from Belarus, which pretended to be a member of the Ukrainian cybersecurity agency. Javed Ali, the former senior director of counterterrorism at the National Security Council, told ABC News that the attacks could escalate to affect utilities, such as gas and electricity. ""Those will be escalatory steps from Russia and that will also likely be integrated with physical military operations all designed to bring cascading effects against Ukraine,"" he said. Madnick warned that cyberattacks on the Ukrainian computer systems could potentially spill over to other regions depending on how close computer networks work. However, he noted, that U.S. officials are paying close attention to online activity. Ali said it's hard to predict if Russia would take such an action on the West since it would mean an immediate retaliation from countries with their own state-of-the-art tools and tactics. ""The thresholds for those operations being launched, the effects, [and] the duration those are all things would have to be thought through very carefully,"" Ali said. ""But U.S. Cyber Command is the lead for military operations from the United States, has a world-class capability."" The Department of Homeland Security, the agency tasked with the domestic response to the invasion in Ukraine, has set up a page on the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency’s website specifically warning of cyber-attacks emanating from Russia. Earlier this week, the U.S. Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency sent an advisory to businesses and organizations urging them to enact a ""shields up"" guidance. ""While there are not currently any specific credible threats to the U.S. homeland, we are mindful of the potential for the Russian government to consider escalating its destabilizing actions in ways that may impact others outside of Ukraine,"" the agency said in its letter. The federal government has called on businesses to make sure their information technology teams update their computer software to close any vulnerabilities and train their employees to watch out for any malware. Madnick said the preparedness of such attacks varies by sector and their experience as cyberattack victims. ""Organizations like banks that have been targeted for a long time have done a better job in shoring up their cybersecurity,"" he said. ""Others, like hospitals and smaller municipalities that haven’t been attacked in the past tend not to do well."" Madnick said when it comes to individual Americans, there is very little they could do to prevent an indirect attack on the country's infrastructure systems, but they should always prepare for the possibility. He likened it to preparing for a big storm and suggested that individuals who are concerned about their money should always have cash available for emergencies. Madnick also urged people to back up their important computer files, including bank statements, important e-mails and other documents frequently and to offline sources such as an external drive. ""Everyone should be doing this regardless of increasing cyber threats,"" he said. Madnick said cyber attackers linked to foreign agencies wouldn't likely conduct attacks that target individual Americans, but people should still be mindful of the vulnerabilities in their tech. Having updated anti-virus and malware software, staying on top of computer updates and avoiding any suspicious links and e-mails, go a long way he said. ""Cyberattacks and cyber security are not something we talk about a lot, but we need to,"" he said. ""This is not a brand new issue."" ABC News' Pierre Thomas contributed to this report.",3,,,,6
2022-02-25,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/International/questions-ukraine-russia-conflict-answered/story?id=83085067,"Questions about the Ukraine-Russia conflict, answered","Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday launched an all-out military assault on Ukraine after weeks of denying ""hysteria"" from the West about the possibility of a Russian invasion. Despite calling the attack a ""special military operation"" in the eastern Donbas region, bombing campaigns began across almost the entirety of Ukraine, including near the capital of Kyiv, and Russian forces crossed borders from three sides of Ukraine, including Russian-occupied Crimea to the south and Ukraine's neighbor Belarus to the north. Putin claimed Russia's plans did not include occupying Ukraine, while warning other countries not to interfere or ""face consequences greater than any you have faced in history."" This is not the first time in recent years that Russia has invaded Ukraine, a former Soviet republic. In 2014, Russia invaded Ukraine and annexed Crimea. Here's what we know and don't: Why is Putin invading Ukraine? In December, the Kremlin published two draft treaties laying out its demands as it massed troops and weaponry around Ukraine. Chief among them were ""security guarantees"" that NATO bar Ukraine from membership and that the western military alliance (which started as a collective security pact against the Soviet Union) pull back its forces from Eastern European member states. But in a ranting speech Monday night, Putin went further, laying out his false pretext for an invasion by questioning Ukraine's legitimacy as a country and even claiming it needed to be liberated from Nazis and pro-Nazi people. Putin also signaled he sees the current democratically elected government in Ukraine as criminal. In addition, Putin used his speech Monday night to lament the end of the Soviet Union and claim that the countries created from Soviet republics weren't really independent. That led President Joe Biden and other world leaders to accuse Putin of trying to reestablish a Soviet empire -- something Putin denied the next day. While it's impossible to see inside Putin's mind, those stated concerns have proven false. On Tuesday, he warned Russia was ready to provide ""military assistance"" to the two Russian-created separatist republics in eastern Ukraine, the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic and Luhansk People's Republic. But his assault on Ukraine hit targets far beyond those tiny separatist areas, where Russian forces have been covertly stationed since 2014. ""This was never about genuine security concerns on their part. It was always about naked aggression, about Putin's desire for empire by any means necessary,"" Biden said Thursday. Who is involved? Russia had been holding huge joint military exercises within Belarus, which shares a border with Ukraine, in the weeks leading up to the invasion -- while scoffing at concerns they would be used for an invasion. On Thursday, Russian and Belarusian forces attacked Ukraine from the north. Other states, including the U.S. and European Union countries, had been attempting to resolve the conflict diplomatically. For weeks, the U.S., NATO, France, Germany, and others engaged in talks with Russia, while threatening heavy sanctions for any invasion and arming Ukraine with defensive lethal weapons. But Biden and other Western leaders have made clear they will not deploy troops to Ukraine to support its military. Still, a U.S. official told ABC News that surrounding nations are worried they will be overwhelmed with refugees fleeing Ukraine. Those surrounding nations include Poland, a NATO ally. The Baltic States -- Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania -- also border Russia to the west and are members of NATO. Should Russia invade any of them, as some fear, the United States has said it will uphold NATO's Article 5, which says an attack on any NATO country is an attack on them all and necessitates a military response. ""The United States, together with our allies, will defend every inch of NATO territory,"" Biden said Tuesday. Biden has deployed thousands of U.S. troops to Europe, including the Baltics, to reassure allies of that promise. What do we know about the separatists? Putin recognized two Moscow-backed rebel regions within eastern Ukraine as independent states. The two self-proclaimed People's Republics of Donetsk and Luhansk want to control the whole of eastern Ukraine's Donbas region, while they only held one-third of it before the Russian invasion. The Russian-controlled separatists claimed they were under attack by Ukraine and were in need of military assistance from Russia ""in repulsing Ukrainian aggression."" Many of these so-called aggressions have been exposed as false flag attacks, and called out as such by the U.S. government and allies. Before pulling out its personnel, the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe's war monitor reported an exponential increase in shelling and other attacks, but made clear it was largely from the separatists' territory. How are the U.S. and its allies responding? Biden announced sanctions against Russian elites and their families and four financial institutions on Thursday, as well as export controls that block key materials like semiconductors for Russia's defense and high-tech industries. Two days earlier, Biden unveiled sanctions on two smaller Russian banks and a first group of oligarchs, warning Putin not to attack or face these harsher punishments -- a threat that was ignored. The U.K. on Thursday announced severe sanctions against more than 100 Russian individuals and entities, including freezing the assets of all major Russian banks and moving to exclude them from the U.K.'s financial system. The European Union also hit Russia with sanctions, including freezing assets. The G-7 countries released a joint statement on Thursday condemning Russia's military aggressions and announcing it will adopt ""severe"" coordinated sanctions. Several members, like Japan and Canada, announced their own, while other nations like South Korea, Australia, and Taiwan have joined, too. The U.S. also sanctioned 24 Belarusian officials, businesspeople, defense agencies and firms, state-owned companies and banks and financial institutions in response to ""Belarus's support for, and facilitation of"" Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the Treasury Department said in a statement. What's at stake? At least 137 people have been killed so far and several hundred have been injured, according to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. As the conflict continues to unfold, many Ukrainians will likely be forced to leave their country en masse, becoming refugees. There also may be large numbers of casualties. Russian troops reportedly took full control of the area around the Chernobyl nuclear power station, including the plant itself, on Thursday, according to Ukraine's prime minister. The zone is about 60 miles north of Kyiv. The destroyed Chernobyl reactor itself is sealed under a giant containment shield, a stadium-sized metal structure that was built over it and completed a few years ago. But the biggest stakes are the rules-based order and general respect for sovereignty in Europe that has helped prevent all-out war for decades, potentially providing a playbook for further land grabs from Putin or other strongmen around the world.",29,,,,19
2022-02-25,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/International/nato-factors-ukraine-russia-conflict/story?id=83090926,How NATO factors into the Ukraine-Russia conflict,"Ukraine is not a member of NATO, though the international security alliance has been a key player in its ongoing conflict with Russia, which escalated to a full-scale invasion by Russian forces Thursday. Since the United States helped form NATO, or the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, in 1949 to counter Soviet aggression in Europe, the alliance has grown to 30 member countries, including three former Soviet republics -- the Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. In 2008, NATO appeared to open the door to membership to two more former Soviet republics when its heads of government declared that Georgia and Ukraine ""will become members of NATO."" Neither have formally received a pathway to eventual membership, with corruption concerns and a lack of consensus among members seen in part as holding back Ukraine's invitation. Russian President Vladimir Putin has demanded that Ukraine never join the alliance as he seeks to limit NATO’s presence in Eastern Europe. Putin's military operation has prompted NATO allies, worried about further escalation, to issue sanctions meant to impact the Russian economy, bolster troops along the alliance's Eastern flank and repeatedly warn that an attack on one NATO member is an attack on all. In the wake of Russia's attack on Ukraine, President Joe Biden announced that NATO will convene a summit Friday to ""affirm our solidarity and to map out the next steps we will take to further strengthen all aspects of our NATO alliance."" Biden has repeatedly said the U.S. won't be sending troops to engage with Russia in Ukraine, though he has recently authorized the deployment of ground and air forces in Europe to support NATO's eastern flank allies -- Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and Romania -- in response to Russian aggression. Following Thursday's attack on Ukraine, Biden said he has authorized additional forces to deploy to Germany as part of NATO's response. According to a senior Defense Department official, 7,000 service members will be deployed to Germany in the coming days. ""Our forces are not going to Europe to fight in Ukraine but to defend our NATO allies and reassure those allies in the East,"" Biden said during an address Thursday. ""As I made crystal clear, the United States will defend every inch of NATO territory with the full force of American power."" During a video address days before he announced a military operation in Ukraine, Putin linked the current crisis directly to Russia's NATO demands, which include a guarantee that NATO stop expanding to the East and pull back its infrastructure from Eastern European countries that joined after the Cold War. He accused the U.S. and NATO of ignoring Russia's demands and blamed the West for the current crisis in Ukraine. The potential impact of the Ukraine conflict on U.S. interests is considered ""significant,"" by the Council on Foreign Relations, which said in part that the conflict ""risks further deterioration of U.S.-Russia relations and greater escalation if Russia expands its presence in Ukraine or into NATO countries."" ""I think we shouldn't get fixated only on Ukraine,"" Doug Lute, a former U.S. ambassador to NATO and ABC News contributor, told ABC News Live following Putin's speech. ""[Putin's] ambitions beyond that are to essentially rewind the clock 30 years and reverse the progress made in Western Europe, certainly Central and Eastern Europe, and if possible, break the ties between the United States and its European allies."" Were the conflict to go beyond Ukraine and impact NATO members, that could lead the organization to invoke its mutual self-defense clause -- what's known as Article 5 of the NATO treaty, which states that ""an armed attack against one or more of them in Europe or North America shall be considered an attack against them all."" If one ally is attacked, the others will respond with necessary action, including armed force, ""to restore and maintain the security of the North Atlantic area."" The first and only time NATO invoked Article 5 was in response to the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, in support of the U.S. On Thursday, Biden said the U.S. and its NATO allies ""will meet our Article 5 commitments"" if necessary in response to Russian aggression, though they are seeking to deescalate the conflict through increased sanctions. ""If [Putin] did move into NATO countries, we will be involved,"" Biden told reporters. ""The only thing that I am convinced of is -- if we don't stop now, he'll be emboldened. If we don't move against him now with these significant sanctions, he will be emboldened."" U.S. officials see Article 5 as another deterrent for any further Russian aggression. ""Is it a possibility that Putin goes beyond Ukraine? Sure, it's a possibility, but there's something very powerful standing in the way of that -- that's something we call Article 5 of NATO,"" Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in an interview with ABC's David Muir on Thursday. ""The president's been very clear that we will defend every inch of NATO territory. I think that's the most powerful deterrent against President Putin going beyond Ukraine."" One ""gray area"" around NATO's Article 5 response is Russian cyberattacks and their impacts beyond Ukraine, according to U.S. Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.), who oversees the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. ""The real deal is if they suddenly decide to shut down all the power in Ukraine, chances are that may shut down the power in eastern Poland, where American and NATO troops are located,"" Warner told reporters Thursday. ""If they shut down the hospital systems in Poland, and people die because you can't operate, we are suddenly outside of the hypothetical realm of what could constitute what's called an Article 5 violation, where if you attack one NATO nation, you attack all 30 NATO nations. And these hypotheticals become a reality."" If Russia responds to NATO allies' sanctions with cyberattacks, ""we are again going into uncharted territory,"" he said. Last year, NATO said the alliance would consider whether to invoke Article 5 in response to a cyberattack ""on a case-by-case basis."" When asked by ABC White House correspondent MaryAlice Parks on Thursday if the White House thought a cyberattack against a NATO member would trigger an Article 5 response, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said that'd be a ""point of discussion."" ""That, again, is up to the NATO alliance to determine, but obviously a cyberattack does constitute an attack, so that would certainly be a point of discussion among the NATO members,"" she said.

2022-02-24,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/International/americans-care-ukraine-russia-conflict/story?id=82907932,Why Americans should care about the Ukraine-Russia conflict,"After weeks of mounting tensions and warnings from United States officials about an imminent attack, Russia's military launched its invasion of Ukraine early Thursday. Russia has spent weeks building up military forces near eastern Ukraine, amassing more than 150,000 troops in Belarus and on the Russian side of the border, according to U.S. officials, before it invaded, striking several cities and military bases in Ukraine, including Kyiv, its capital. The Kremlin had repeatedly denied warnings of an invasion before Russian President Vladimir Putin announced his intention to conduct a ""special military operation"" in Ukraine Thursday. Leading up to the invasion, Americans were somewhat mixed on how the U.S. should respond. In a recent poll from Quinnipiac University, 57% of Americans said the U.S. should not send troops into Ukraine if Russia invades, and 54% support Biden's decision to deploy troops to support NATO allies. Last week, as U.S. officials continued to warn about an invasion and the escalating conflict, President Joe Biden addressed the American public and again made clear the U.S. will not send troops to support Ukraine. But he promised to defend ""every inch"" of NATO territory, already deploying several thousand more troops to Europe, and to support the Ukrainian people and their government with lethal defensive weapons, economic aid and crippling U.S. and allied sanctions on Russia. In the wake of the invasion, Biden announced new sanctions on Russian banks. That high level of U.S. involvement is necessary, he said, because ""this is about more than just Russia and Ukraine."" ""It's about standing for what we believe in, for the future that we want for our world, for liberty, the right of countless countries to choose their own destiny, and the right of people to determine their own futures, or the principle that a country can't change its neighbor's borders by force,"" Biden said. ""If we do not stand for freedom where it is at risk today, we'll surely pay a steeper price tomorrow."" To understand the United States' vested interest in the conflict, you'd have to go back to the Cold War, Craig Albert, an associate professor of political science and the director of Intelligence and Security Studies at Augusta University, told ABC News. To counter Soviet aggression in Europe, the U.S. helped form the security alliance NATO, or the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, in 1949. In the years since, NATO has expanded several times, including adding three former Soviet republics. Ukraine, a former Soviet republic that is bordered by Russia on the east, is not a NATO member, though in 2008 the alliance opened the door to membership. Putin has demanded this not happen, as he seeks to limit NATO along Russia's border. ""Ukraine has attached itself to the West, to NATO,"" Albert said. ""They still have military agreements, treaties, economic treaties, business treaties or relationships, even though there's no NATO treaty in place between Ukraine and NATO and the U.S."" One previous agreement is the Budapest Memorandum on Security Assurances, reached between the U.S. and Russia in 1994, under which Ukraine would turn over its nuclear weapons stockpile in exchange for security assurances against threats to its territorial integrity and sovereignty, including seeking ""immediate United Nations Security Council action to provide assistance to Ukraine."" Russia would later flout that agreement when it seized Crimea in 2014. The NATO members bordering Russia also present a concern to U.S. officials. The potential impact of the Ukraine conflict on U.S. interests is considered ""significant,"" by the Council on Foreign Relations, which said in part that the conflict ""risks further deterioration of U.S.-Russia relations and greater escalation if Russia expands its presence in Ukraine or into NATO countries."" As Russia tries to ""reassert itself into the great power game,"" the U.S. is seeking to maintain the balance of power in Europe and ""protect Ukraine as a buffer against Russian-perceived aggression in Europe itself,"" Albert said, noting that Ukraine is ""strategically important"" for Russia, the U.S. and NATO. NATO is ""critical to U.S. policy in Europe,"" and supporting Ukraine for the past 30-plus years ""has been integral to U.S. security policy for the European continent as a whole,"" Matthew Pauly, an associate professor of history at Michigan State University who is an expert on Russia, Ukraine and Eastern Europe, told ABC News. ""There's no doubt that the most eastern-facing NATO member states are quite rightly anxious about Russia's actions in Ukraine,"" Pauly said. ""The United States obviously views it as its duty to oblige by the responsibilities of NATO membership to hold the line on the eastern front of NATO."" Indeed, the U.S. had sent in troops amid the Russian aggression to support NATO's eastern flank. On Thursday, Biden announced he was authorizing additional U.S. force capabilities to deploy to Germany as part of NATO's response force -- including the 8,500 troops put on ""heightened alert"" last month. ""Our forces are not going to Europe to fight in Ukraine but to defend our NATO allies and reassure those allies in the East,"" Biden said during an address Thursday. ""As I made crystal clear, the United States will defend every inch of NATO territory with the full force of American power."" The U.S. has sent thousands of additional troops to Central and Eastern Europe in recent weeks, though Biden made it clear he won't be sending any to Ukraine to fight Russia and had stressed the importance of diplomacy toward achieving de-escalation. In an interview with NBC News anchor Lester Holt earlier this month, Biden acknowledged the risk of further aggression. When asked what scenario could prompt him to send troops to aid Americans in Ukraine, Biden said, ""There's not. That's a world war when Americans and Russia start shooting at one another."" ""We're dealing with one of the largest armies in the world. It's a very different situation, and things could go crazy quickly,"" he said. The risk of the conflict escalating beyond Ukraine is ""high,"" Michael ""Mick"" Patrick Mulroy, ABC News national security and defense analyst, said on ABC News Live last week. ""It should be a concern to everybody,"" he said. Another important dimension to U.S. involvement in the crisis has to do with its support of Ukraine as a democracy, Pauly said. Since 1991, when Ukraine declared its independence, the U.S. has offered ""substantial"" foreign aid, particularly in the 1990s, to help it emerge from the Soviet period, democratize and develop a free market economy, he said. ""Ukraine is a democracy, it's the only really functioning democracy of the few in the former Soviet space,"" Pauly said. ""Although democratization has had sort of a challenging path in Ukraine, it's hard to argue that it is not a democracy."" ""Democracy in Ukraine is worth protecting,"" he continued. ""Democracy is our best guarantee against war and best assurance of peace."" The U.S., along with Western allies, has also voiced support for Ukraine maintaining its sovereignty and territorial integrity against Russian aggression. Biden said the U.S. has been supplying Ukraine's military with arms, training and intelligence to help defend itself. ""Nations have a right to sovereignty and territorial integrity,"" the president said last week. ""They have the freedom to set their own course and choose with whom they will associate."" The exact impact of an invasion beyond the front lines remains unclear. Though Biden warned the American people that there would be ""consequences at home"" -- foremost an increase in energy prices as a result. ""I will not pretend this will be painless,"" Biden said last week. ""There could be impact on our energy prices, so we're taking active steps to alleviate the pressure on our own energy markets and offset rising prices."" In an incursion limited to eastern Ukraine, there could be a rise in the price of oil by $5 or $10 a barrel, according to Patrick De Haan of GasBuddy. Currently, a $1 per barrel rise equates to about a 1.5 cents per gallon rise in the national average price of gas. In response to sanctions, Russia, could retaliate by curbing oil exports, he said, impacting global markets. If higher oil and gas prices cause the Federal Reserve to be more aggressive in its monetary tightening, that could also impact inflation, according to Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody's Analytics. Cyberwarfare also remains a concern. Last month, the Department of Homeland Security warned that the U.S. response to a possible Russian invasion could result in a cyberattack launched against the U.S. by the Russian government or its proxies. Amid increased warnings of a Russian invasion of Ukraine, senior law enforcement and homeland security officials last week urged private industry and state officials to shore up their cyber infrastructure. There's also the impact on American troops, as more military forces are being deployed to support NATO countries. ""I think [Americans] should be paying attention to this because it could significantly affect strategic deployments of U.S. personnel,"" Albert said. ""If nothing else, just people moving from where they are in their typical assignments right now, to move somewhere else, more strategically positioned against, perhaps, a Russian invasion.""

2022-02-23,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/analysis-inside-process-shutting-us-embassy/story?id=83060002,ANALYSIS: How the US government shut down the US Embassy in Ukraine,"Russian President Vladimir Putin has been threatening aggressive action against Ukraine for weeks in an attempt to ensure Russian security. These overtones have increased by the day, forcing the United States and the rest of the world to react and respond to a growing threat to Ukrainian sovereignty, its residents and the tens of thousands of American personnel and citizens living and working in the country. The need to protect American assets and personnel in country has become more necessary, resulting in a Feb. 12 “Do Not Travel” notification, the highest the State Department issues. An order was also issued, mandating the immediate evacuation of almost all government personnel in the country and the closure of the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv. Under any departure circumstance, the Chief of Mission (ambassador) coordinates with the Diplomatic Security Service (DSS) Regional Security officer and the Embassy’s Emergency Action Committee (EAC), which is responsible for planning for and directing emergency responses in times of crisis or during threats against an embassy and/or its personnel. DSS special agents are the most widely deployed American assets throughout the world, protecting over 275 U.S. diplomatic missions in over 170 countries and 30 U.S. cities. These missions include investigation and protection and enable the agents to get involved in all aspects of American foreign policy, from international criminal identification and apprehension of criminals and terrorists to the protection of important U.S. figures and citizens, such as the secretary of state, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations and other senior diplomats. Similar to the recent drawdown of the U.S. Embassy in Kabul, the situation in the Ukraine is forcing the DSS Agents to adapt and respond. In Kabul, the drawdown triggered the immediate evacuation of all staff from the embassy. In Ukraine, the State Department initially ordered an authorized departure, allowing voluntary relocation of families and some staff, and then moved to an ordered departure, the highest level of non-emergency departure for State Department personnel. Like a drawdown, an ordered departure is not voluntary. This departure mandates that all family members and non-essential staff are ordered to depart on evacuation status. Typically, the ambassador will designate the DSS RSO as the incident commander for contingency operations impacting the embassy and its personnel, including during drawdowns or departures. As the Incident Commander, an RSO is empowered and authorized to do all that is necessary to protect people, property, materials and assets located at the embassy or in country. The first step is to secure and destroy all sensitive information and equipment at the embassy, including those used by the intelligence agencies. This includes facilitating the removal of sensitive intelligence or gear deemed of national security significance back to the United States with the use of DSS Diplomatic Couriers. To assist, the RSO is empowered and authorized by law to supervise and direct any and all Department of Defense (DOD) assets to include the Marine Security Guard Detachment. In most cases, when a drawdown or departure is authorized, RSOs will call in a supplemental Marine Security Augmentation Unit (MSAU) which can be a force multiplier during the closure of an embassy. RSOs can also call in additional DSS assets, including elite Mobile Security Deployments (MSD) teams, which is the State Department’s dedicated on-call crisis response tactical element. MSD teams are available to deploy anywhere in the world within 12 hours notice and provide RSOs with supplemental equipment, skills and capability similar to a military Special Operations team. Unlike their DOD counterparts, these MSD teams are exclusively made up of specially selected and trained DSS special agents, not soldiers. While securing the embassy and destroying sensitive information and equipment is critical, the evacuation of Kyiv embassy personnel is also a priority. Depending on the circumstances on the ground, the evacuation of personnel can be facilitated by commercial or DOD assets. In the case of Kabul, DOD assets were used but the sensitivity of the situation in the Ukraine means the RSOs had to coordinate and rely on commercial modes of travel outside of the capital to Lviv or other parts of Eastern Europe. And while the RSOs are handling the evacuation of embassy personnel and the closure of the embassy, the fate of American citizens, an estimated 30,000 in Ukraine, must also be factored into the planning and execution. Under the State Departments’ “No Double Standard” policy, American citizens were warned to leave the country due to the threat. They can leave by commercial means or, if an emergency happens, work with the U.S. Embassy to get out. As the embassy in Kyiv was secured, the last Americans to leave were the DSS agents assigned there. One of their final tasks was to lower the United States flag and ensure the ambassador safely takes it and then secure compound. But even with the embassy closed and flag removed, the State Department has announced this is hopefully a temporary measure, meaning that when the circumstances are right, the embassy building could be reopened. When that happens, the DSS personnel will be the first back in. Donald J.

2022-02-17,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/International/tensions-rise-ukraine-russian-backed-separatist-shelling-hits/story?id=82962555,Tensions rise in Ukraine as Russian-backed separatist shelling hits nursery school,"LVIV, Ukraine -- Tensions have jumped in eastern Ukraine as Russian-controlled separatists there shelled a nursery in Ukrainian government-held territory and warned of escalation, amid concerns that Russia may be looking to build a pretext to launch an invasion. Mortar rounds fired by the separatists struck kindergarten number 21 in the village of Stanytsa Luhansk on Thursday morning close to the frontline with Ukrainian troops, injuring three adults, according to Ukraine’s military. Video filmed by Ukrainian soldiers showed a hole blown in the school’s wall. Twenty children had to be evacuated but were unhurt, Ukraine’s armed forces said. Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy accused the Russian-backed separatists of “provocative shelling” and as the United States warned Russia is now preparing to launch an invasion in the coming days. President Joe Biden on Thursday told reporters “every indicator we have is they’re prepared to go into Ukraine, and “we have reason to believe they are engaged in a false flag operation to have an excuse to go in."" NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg also said he was concerned Russia “is trying to stage a pretext for an armed attack against Ukraine.” The firing occurred at the same time as the Russian-controlled separatists accused Ukraine of “large-scale” shelling onto their territory and warned of a “substantial worsening” of the situation along the front line. The self-declared Peoples Republics of Donetsk and Luhansk on Thursday issued “emergency statements” claiming Ukrainian troops had fired onto civilian areas in nine villages, including with heavy caliber mortars. Rodion Miroshnik, a political advisor for the Lugansk ‘republic’, accused Ukraine of ordering a “massive provocation.” The two unrecognized statelets control part of Ukraine’s Donbas regions, after Russia helped create them during fighting in 2014 and they remain heavily dependent on Moscow and its troops, which are covertly stationed there. For weeks, the separatist leadership and Russian state media have accused Ukraine of preparing to mount an offensive against the separatist territories. Western officials and independent experts worry Russia may be laying the groundwork for a pretext it could use to justify a military intervention should it choose to attack. This week, Russia opened a war crimes investigation into separatist claims to have found mass graves, supposedly containing the victims of alleged Ukrainian atrocities. Russian President Vladimir Putin told a press conference on Tuesday “genocide” was taking place in eastern Ukraine. At least 14,000 people have died during the eight-year conflict in Ukraine, many of the victims died following indiscriminate artillery fire by both sides. However, no evidence has emerged of large-scale massacres or genocide as Russia claims. Late Wednesday night, Russia's mission to the United Nations circulated a document that alleged Ukraine had committed large-scale war crimes in the eastern regions ahead of a U.N. Security Council session on the war. U.S. Secretary of State Anthony Blinken in the U.N. council session Thursday accused Russia of planning to manufacture a pretext for an imminent invasion of Ukraine, singling out the mass grave claims and saying Moscow might also stage phony drone strikes or chemical or biological weapons attacks. Russia might try to claim such an event as “ethnic cleansing or a genocide.” Blinken said. He said that would make a “mockery of a concept that we in this chamber do not take lightly.” “Nor do I take lightly, based on my family history,” said Blinken, a reference to his stepfather who survived the Holocaust. Blinken said the U.S.’ information now indicates that Russia’s build up of forces near Ukraine means they “are preparing to launch an attack against Ukraine in the coming days.” He warned that after spreading false claims about a Ukrainian attack on the separatist, Russia might convene high-level emergency meeting to address them, after which it would launch an assault. Blinken said the Russian plan would see aerial bombardment across Ukraine, backed up by massive cyberattacks, as Russian tanks and troops moved on cities, including the capital Kyiv. ""Here today, we are laying it out in great detail with a hope that by sharing what we know with the world, we can influence Russia to abandon the path of war and choose a different path while there's still time,"" Blinken said. Russian officials have dismissed the U.S. accusations as “hysteria” and pointed out that a date announced for the possible Russian attack this week, Feb. 16, had passed without anything materializing. ""We have long ago clarified everything and explained everything, and the announced date of the so-called invasion is behind us, so therefore, my advice to you is not present yourself in an awkward situation,"" Russia’s Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Vershinin told Blinken during the UN council meeting. The Feb. 16 was reported as a possible day for a Russian attack after U.S. officials privately briefed NATO allies last week, but U.S. officials have said the reason they identified it was because of information Putin has ordered his military to be ready to go from that date. Russia’s parliament earlier this week passed a law appealing to Putin to recognize the separatist regions as independent from Ukraine. The step would be a major escalation, opening the path for Russia to formally annex them as it did Crimea in 2014. But Putin so far has signaled he will not act on the appeal, saying on Tuesday that Russia will continue to work through the so-called Minsk agreements. The 2015 peace deal aimed at end the conflict in eastern Ukraine. Russia recognizing the self-declared republics would amount to it exiting the Minsk deal. Russia’s military this week has claimed to be moving some of its forces back from near Ukraine and its Defense Ministry on Thursday insisted again some troops were now returning to base. A spokesman said, the first units from Russia’s western and southern military districts, had already reached their home bases far from the border and more were moving there now. But NATO countries and Ukraine, as well as independent analysts, have said so far there is no evidence of Russia is withdrawing substantial forces and that in reality it is continuing its build up. Huge Russian exercises are continuing in neighboring Belarus and the Black Sea, scheduled to go on until Feb. 20, after which Russia has said its forces will leave. A Russian deputy foreign minister on Thursday said it was time for western countries “to calm down,” saying the exercises would soon end.

2022-02-17,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/doj-official-warns-companies-foolish-shore-cybersecurity-amid/story?id=82959520,DOJ official warns companies 'foolish' not to shore up cybersecurity amid Russia tensions,"A top Justice Department official issued a stark warning Thursday to companies in the U.S. and abroad, calling on them to immediately shore up their cybersecurity defenses amid a potential Russian invasion of Ukraine. ""Given the very high tensions that we are experiencing, companies of any size and of all sizes would be foolish not to be preparing right now as we speak -- to increase their defenses, to do things like patching, to heighten their alert systems, to be monitoring in real-time their cybersecurity,"" deputy attorney general Lisa Monaco said in remarks at the Munich Cybersecurity Conference. ""They need to be as we say, 'shields up' and to be really on the most heightened level of alert that they can be and taking all necessary precautions."" Monaco said the threat was in no way ""hypothetical,"" citing the devastating NotPetya cyberattack in 2017 that started in Ukraine before spreading globally and causing billions of dollars worth of damage. ""I think cybercriminals need to know that -- and cyber malicious actors need to know -- that attacks on critical infrastructure are unacceptable and will be met with response,"" Monaco said. It comes as various U.S. agencies warned earlier this week of a cyberattack happening at the same time as a potential Russian invasion of Ukraine. On a call with state and local officials on Monday, top cybersecurity officials from the Department of Homeland Security and FBI warned of potential attacks on U.S. cyber infrastructure in concert with a physical invasion of Ukraine, according to a person familiar with the call. Last Friday, DHS explicitly warned of Russian cyber-attack and made a veiled mention at the ongoing geopolitical climate. ""The Russian government has used cyber as a key component of their force projection over the last decade, including previously in Ukraine in the 2015 timeframe,"" the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) warned in an online post. ""The Russian government understands that disabling or destroying critical infrastructure—including power and communications—can augment pressure on a country's government, military and population and accelerate their acceding to Russian objectives."" Ukrainian officials believed they were already the victim of a Russian cyber-attack earlier this year, when suspected Russian hackers defaced Ukrainian government websites, according to officials. Wednesday, the FBI, CISA and the National Security Agency are warned defense contractors of that Russian state sponsored actors continue to attempt and exploit their networks. From 2020 to at least February 2022, Russian state sponsored cyber actors have targeted U.S. cleared defense contractors, according to Wednesday's joint release. The agencies say Russians have targeted various sectors in the defense and intelligence world including intelligence, weapons and missile development and software development. The agencies warn that Russian threat actors use Microsoft 365 to first enter the system and gain official credentials and then send malware to compromise devices without the person knowing. ""Historically, Russian state-sponsored cyber actors have used common but effective tactics to gain access to target networks, including spear phishing, credential harvesting, brute force/password spray techniques, and known vulnerability exploitation against accounts and networks with weak security,"" the joint bulletin says. ""These continued intrusions have enabled the actors to acquire sensitive, unclassified information, as well as CDC-proprietary and export-controlled technology,"" the FBI, NSA and CISA said.",3,,,,6
2022-02-16,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/International/nato-warns-russia-building-troops-ukraine-holds-defiant/story?id=82929666,"NATO warns Russia still building up troops, as Ukraine holds defiant national holiday","LVIV, Ukraine -- NATO’s secretary general warned that Russia appears to still be increasing the number of its troops near Ukraine, despite Moscow announcing it has begun withdrawing some military units from the border. Ukraine on Wednesday held a nationwide “Unity Day,"" hanging flags and holding ceremonies to sing the nation's anthem on the day that U.S. officials had said a Russian invasion could take place. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy instituted the public holiday in an apparent signal of defiance that also indicated Ukrainian skepticism that an attack would take place. Russian officials, meanwhile, mocked claims that the attack would materialize Wednesday, saying it illustrated Western “hysteria” around Russia’s buildup of troops close to Ukraine. Russia’s military a day earlier said some of its troops have started to withdraw after completing “exercises” and on Wednesday said that process was continuing, releasing new video showing a trainload of armored vehicles rolling across a bridge from Crimea to Russia. But NATO’s secretary general Jens Stoltenberg said that despite the few videos released by Russia, the alliance so far sees no evidence of actual withdrawal and that more troops have continued to arrive. “So far we have not seen any de-escalation on the ground. On the contrary, it appears that Russia continues the military buildup,"" Stoltenberg told reporters before a two-day meeting of NATO’s 30 defense ministers in Brussels. “We are, of course, monitoring very closely what Russia does in and around Ukraine. What we see is that they have increased the number of troops and more troops are on their way and so, so far, no de-escalation,” he said. But Stoltenberg said the alliance still hoped Russia would choose a diplomatic way out of the crisis, noting recent statements from President Vladimir Putin expressing a readiness to engage with the West. “Of course, we hear all the messages about diplomacy and we are ready to engage in diplomatic efforts with Russia,"" Stoltenberg said. Russia’s military said units from its western and southern military districts, that have amassed thousands of troops near Ukraine, have begun returning to their bases. The defense ministry on Wednesday said the western military district units had completed loading their tanks onto transports and were now beginning a “1000 kilometer” journey back to their home base. Russia is continuing to hold huge exercises in neighboring Belarus and in the Black Sea, which are due to run until the end of this week. Western and Ukrainian officials, as well as independent military analysts have expressed skepticism that the announced moves reflect a true pull-back, noting that previously announced withdrawals have amounted to little more than shuffling forces around. U.S. officials also said they have not seen a real withdrawal. ""On the contrary, we continue to see forces, especially forces in the vanguard of any renewed aggression against Ukraine, continuing to be at the border, to mass at the border,"" Secretary of State Anthony Blinken told ABC’s George Stephanopoulos on ""Good Morning America"" Wednesday. Russia has amassed an estimated 150,000 troops on three sides of Ukraine, a presence that includes long-range artillery, advanced aircraft and dozens of attack helicopters. U.S. officials have warned in recent days that some of the troops appear to be moving into ""firing positions"". Satellite photographs from a private company and videos spotted on social media by open source researchers appear to show that for now Russia has continued to move forces closer to the border with Ukraine. A large number of cellphone videos have appeared on TikTok that seem to show convoys of tanks and armored vehicles moving in the Belgorod region that borders Ukraine. The Russian state newspaper Izvestia cited defense ministry sources that the units re-basing were the western district’s 3rd Motor Rifle Division and the southern district's 42nd Guards and 150th Motorized-Rifle Division. But analysts said that the units' home base are located close to Ukraine in any case. The 3rd Motor Rifle Division is based in the town of Boguchar, only about 60 miles from the border. It means the units rather than pulling back from the border are simply moving to a different location along the border. Belarus' foreign minister Vladimir Makey said at a press conference on Wednesday that all Russian troops would leave his country after the joint drills end February 20. U.S. officials continue to believe it is likely Russia will launch a large-scale invasion, potentially as early as this week, although they don't believe Putin has made a final decision yet. ABC News learned that U.S. officials had briefed allies that Wednesday could be the day of the attack because they had information Putin has ordered his military to be ready to go from that day. The U.S. assesses that Russia now has all the necessary forces in place to launch a major attack if Putin chooses. It believes such an attack would not be limited to eastern Ukraine but would target the capital Kyiv, aiming to decapitate the government in a lightning strike planned to be over within 72 hours. The operation would be preceded by large-scale cyber attacks and aerial bombardments against critical infrastructure, before special forces enter Kyiv to target Ukraine's leadership. Russian forces in neighboring Belarus would sweep in from the north, according to the U.S. assessment. A cyber attack hit the website of Ukraine’s defense ministry and two of its largest state banks on Tuesday night. The cyber defense department of Ukraine’s national security service said the DDoS attack was very large, but the damage appeared limited, it said due to preparations Ukraine had taken in recent weeks. After some disruption in online payments, the two banks, Privat Bank and the State Savings Bank, said their systems were working again. The security service said the U.S. was assisting Ukraine in protecting itself against the attack. Ukraine’s government has appeared more skeptical of the invasion risk, with senior officials saying they did not see signs Russia was preparing to attack Wednesday. President Zelenskyy inspected military exercises in the Rivne region near Belarus, wearing army fatigues. In an address filmed selfie-style on his phone earlier Wednesday, he told Ukrainians, “Our shared desire to live unites us, to live together in peace. We are in Ukraine and no one can defend our home like we can.” In Lviv, the largest city in western Ukraine, hundreds of cadets at a local military academy gathered around a towering flag pole on Wednesday morning for a ceremony, where they sang the national anthem, which begins “Ukraine is not dead yet.”",14,,,,13
2022-02-15,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/International/russia-signals-troop-pullback-ukraine-border-exercises/story?id=82896967,Russia says some troops returning to base from Ukraine border,"LVIV, Ukraine -- Russia's military said some troops massed near Ukraine will begin returning to their bases on Tuesday following the completion of what it called ""exercises,"" a potential sign of de-escalation amid continuing fears of a possible Russian invasion. Russia's Ministry of Defense said units from its southern and western military districts, which have deployed thousands of troops close to Ukraine's border, had begun returning to barracks. Video released by the military showed what it said were tanks pulling back and being loaded onto rail transports. A spokesman for Russia's southern military district also said its servicemen had begun leaving Crimea, where Russia has built up a large force. The United States and other western officials, as well as independent experts, expressed caution about the development, saying they would wait to see if Russia really pulled back the troops. Major Russian exercises are continuing in neighboring Belarus to the north of Ukraine and in the Black Sea. NATO's Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said that for now, the alliance had not seen ""any sign of de-escalation on the ground from the Russian side"" but noted there were signs for diplomacy from Moscow that gave grounds for ""cautious optimism."" Ukraine's foreign minister said officials would believe the Russian withdrawal ""when we see it."" Hopes that Russia might be moving to de-escalate tensions were almost immediately dimmed by Russia's parliament, which on Tuesday voted to pass a law calling on President Vladimir Putin to recognize two Russian-controlled breakaway regions of Ukraine as independent. The law appeals to Putin to recognize the self-proclaimed ""People's Republics of Donetsk and Luhansk"" in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine, pro-Russian statelets that were created with Moscow's backing and troops during fighting in 2014. Separatist forces, backed by Russian troops, have continued to fight a low-intensity war with the Ukrainian government. The move to recognize the regions would open a path for Russia to formally annex the regions, as it did Crimea eight years ago. This step would likely trigger more Western sanctions and further escalate the crisis. The vote now puts the decision in Putin's hands. But Putin himself on Tuesday later appeared to suggest he would not move to recognize the regions immediately. At a press conference after meeting with Germany's new chancellor Olaf Scholz, who was visiting Moscow, Putin said that while he believed a ""clear majority"" of Russia supported the step, for now, he believed Russia should continue to work within the existing peace agreement aimed at ending the conflict in Ukraine, the 2015 Minsk agreement. ""I start from that we must do everything for the resolution of the problem of Donbas, but do it first of all starting from the unfulfilled possibilities of the Minsk agreement,"" Putin said. The parliament vote was denounced in Ukraine, with an adviser to President Volodymyr Zelensky calling it an ""escalatory action."" Ukraine's foreign ministry said if Putin did follow through with recognition, Russia would ""de-facto and de-jure exit the Minsk agreements, with all the accompanying consequences."" Putin sent mixed messages during the press conference with Scholz, the latest western leader to visit Moscow to urge a diplomatic exit to the crisis. While Putin acknowledged some Russian troops were withdrawing near the Ukraine border, he signaled he did not consider the crisis to be over, saying Russia was still insisting on its key demands for a guarantee that Ukraine will never join NATO. The U.S. and NATO countries have rejected that as a non-starter but offered to engage with Russia on more modest issues, including limits of missile deployments and military exercises. Putin said he was ready to work with the West of discussing some of those proposed confidence-building measures, including a possible restoration of the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces (INF) treaty that the Trump administration pulled out from. But Putin insisted those discussions could not mean Russia was dropping its central demand on NATO. ""We hear that Ukraine isn't ready today to join NATO and they say that they won't take it tomorrow. And will they take it then when it is ready? Well, for us that might already be too late,"" Putin said. ""And so we want to resolve this question right now. In the nearest future in the course of the negotiating process, with peaceful means,"" Putin said. Asked what the week would bring, Putin didn't rule out the crisis could still escalate, though he repeated Russia does ""not want war."" ""How will Russia act next? According to the plan!"" Putin said that no one knew how the situation would develop but that Russia would strive to come to an agreement diplomatically. Scholz said at the press conference that Russian recognizing the separatist regions would be a ""catastrophe."" He expressed hope that diplomacy can work, but said Russia should take ""clear steps to de-escalate the current tensions"" and warned European Union countries would take ""far-reaching measures"" in the event of Russian ""military aggression"" against Ukraine. The U.S. and other western countries have warned that a Russian invasion of Ukraine could come this week. Before the Russian announcement of the partial withdrawal, satellite images and videos spotted on social media by open source researchers appeared to show Russian forces continuing to move closer to Ukraine, with some units taking up what experts said looked like forward positions. The U.S. on Monday announced it was closing its embassy in Kyiv and moving key diplomats to Lviv in western Ukraine amid an ""accelerated"" buildup by Russian forces. Satellite images published by the private company, Maxar, showed substantial new forces close to Ukraine in Crimea, Belarus and in western Russia, including attack helicopters. Cristo Grozev, a well-known open source researcher, said a team working with the group, Conflict Intelligence Team-- that has been tracking the Russian build up for months-- so far had seen evidence of a Russian withdrawal. ""This may well change in the next hours or days,"" Grozev wrote on Twitter. But for now, he said, the convoys they had been tracking moving towards the Ukraine border ""are still moving in the same direction."" On Tuesday evening, Ukraine said a cyberattack had hit the websites of its military and two of the country's largest state banks. The national cybersecurity center said a DDoS attack had struck the public websites of the ministry of defense and Ukraine's armed forces, causing some disruption to online banking for PrivatBank and the State Saving Bank of Ukraine. Russia's announcement that it was pulling back some forces came a day after Russia's Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu briefed Putin that Russia's huge military drills would end in the ""near future."" Shoigu told Putin that ""part of the drills are approaching their completion and part would be completed in the near future."" Russia has consistently denied it has any intention to attack Ukraine using the more than 100,000 troops it has massed near its border. However, Russia has claimed warnings from the U.S. and other Western countries that it may be preparing to launch an invasion as ""hysteria."" Tuesday ""will go down in history as the day the Western propaganda war failed. Disgraced and destroyed without a shot being fired,"" Maria Zakharova, a spokeswoman for Russia's Foreign Ministry, wrote on her Facebook page Tuesday. Military exercises on an unprecedented scale are continuing in Belarus and are due to end on Feb. 20. The U.S. has warned that Russia could launch an invasion of Ukraine this week, reportedly briefing NATO allies last week that it had intelligence the attack could come on Wednesday. Ukraine's government has expressed more skepticism that Russia is ready to attack this week, suggesting it believes the massive Russian buildup is intended to pressure Ukraine with the threat of invasion. Zelensky, in a televised address Monday night, told Ukrainians he was declaring Wednesday, the alleged day of a possible Russian attack, a national holiday. Zelensky's national security adviser, Oleksiy Danilov, told Ukrainian television Monday night that Ukraine did not see signs Russia is preparing to attack on Feb. 16 or 17. ""We recognize all the risks that there are for our country. But the situation is absolutely under control,"" he said.",29,,,,21
2022-02-10,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/International/russia-begins-huge-war-games-belarus-amid-ukraine/story?id=82799211,Russia begins huge war games in Belarus amid Ukraine invasion fears,"KYIV -- Russia has officially kicked off the main phase of huge joint military exercises in Belarus, as Western countries continue to warn Russian forces massed near Ukraine could be used to launch a possible attack. Russia has poured an unprecedented number of troops and equipment into Belarus over recent weeks ahead of the 10-day drills, moving units almost 6,000 miles from its far east and deploying tanks, long-range artillery and advanced fighter jets. The United States and NATO countries have expressed worries that the exercises could be used as a cover for preparations for a possible on Ukraine, whose capital, Kyiv, is less than 200 miles south. But Russia and Belarus have insisted the drills are just defensive war games. Russia’s defense ministry on Thursday said the exercises, called ""Union Resolve 2022,"" will “practice averting and repelling external aggression via a defensive operation, as well as combating terrorism and defending the interests” of Russia and Belarus. The exercises are due to end on Feb. 20 and the Kremlin has said its troops will leave Belarus then. Russia’s deployment of troops to Belarus is part of its broader military buildup massing over 100,000 troops along Ukraine’s eastern border and to the south in Crimea. Independent military analysts have sounded the alarm over the exercises, saying the scale of the Russian deployment is vastly larger than anything since the Cold War and includes units that would be used in a major invasion, such as advanced anti-air defences and Iskander-M long-range missile brigades. Satellite imagery has shown some of the Russian units are parked only a few dozen miles from Ukraine’s border, in areas not officially designated for the exercise. The Belarus drills will coincide with what Western countries and some analysts have said is the window when Russia will reach the point of readiness to launch a major military operation against Ukraine. NATO’s Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg on Thursday warned “the number of Russian forces is going up. The warning time for a possible attack is going down."" “We must be prepared for the worst while remaining strongly committed to finding a political solution,"" Stoltenberg added. Ukrainian officials are much more skeptical and have denied the Russian forces in Belarus appear ready to launch an offensive. Defense Minister Oleksiy Reznikov this week said Ukraine did not see Russia forming any strike groups in Belarus and that it had insufficient forces, he estimated only several thousand. Ukraine's government has said it believes the Russian buildup right now is primarily aimed at putting psychological pressure on Ukraine with the threat of attack. In the next 10 days Russia will make a vast display of military power to the north, east and south of Ukraine, holding exercises on an unprecedented scale also outside Belarus. The period seems likely to be a key moment in determining whether the crisis escalates or if the Russian buildup turns to a bluff. The exercises in Belarus will also overlap with large-scale Russian naval drills in the Black Sea, that on Thursday prompted Ukraine to accuse Moscow of mounting an “unprecedented” naval blockade of Ukrainian ports. Six Russian warships, including amphibious landing ships, entered the Black Sea Wednesday night, to join a fleet already there. Ukraine said it “strongly protests” against the live-fire drills between Feb. 13 and Feb. 19 that are expected to close off access to much of its coast in the Black Sea and to the Sea of Azov. If President Vladimir Putin is preparing to attack, the Russian build up appears to be approaching a point of maximum danger, according to some analysts, who say it has nearly completed its build up of heavy equipment and is now entering a phase where it will move up personnel to man it. That does not mean that Russia will attack — U.S. officials say they believe Putin has not yet made a decision — just that it will have the forces in place to do so within the next two weeks. “Once the second phase of the exercise begins on the 10th, I think they’re going to have everything they need in place and I think that week or the week after would make the most sense for an escalation if Russia is planning on doing an escalation,” Rob Lee, an analyst at Kings College London’s War Studies department, told ABC News. An analysis by Janes, the defense think tank, estimated there are at least 14 Russian battalion tactical groups in Belarus with around 8,000 to 14,000 troops. The U.S. has said it assesses as many as 30,000 could take part. “Best case scenario at the end of the exercise they start moving that equipment out,"" Lee said. But as long as that equipment is still there then the risk is going to be very high of an escalation."" Lee said he believed a military incursion was more likely than not. The Kremlin has denied it has any invasion plans, dismissing it as Western “hysteria."" After meeting the U.K.’s foreign minister in Moscow on Thursday, Russia’s Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov mocked Western allegations Russia was preparing to attack, including claims it might be waiting for the ground to freeze to allow tank movements. “It’s like when they say that Russia is waiting for the ground to freeze so that tanks can easily enter Ukraine,” he added. “It seems that our British colleagues were on similar ground today, off of which bounced all the facts we presented them.” Key talks are taking place in Berlin Thursday aimed at continuing diplomatic efforts to de-escalate the crisis. Ukraine and Russia will meet at the so-called ""Normandy Format,"" the long-running negotiations, mediated by France and Germany, aimed at resolving the conflict between Ukraine and Russian-backed separatists in its east. No breakthrough is expected, but Western countries are hoping the talks can build on the small positive signs for diplomacy that emerged from French President Emmanuel Macron’s meeting with Putin in Moscow at the start of this week.",29,,,,21
2022-02-09,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/International/ukraine-russia-hold-key-talks-crisis-berlin/story?id=82781870,"Ukraine, Russia to hold key talks on crisis in Berlin","KYIV -- A new round of key talks aimed at de-escalating the Ukraine crisis is set to take place in Berlin on Thursday. The talks will follow the so-called Normandy Format, the name of the long-running negotiations between Russia and Ukraine, mediated by France and Germany, and are aimed at ending the conflict between Ukraine and Russian-backed separatists in the country's east. The talks have been largely deadlocked since 2015, but Thursday's meeting is being closely watched for signs that a flurry of diplomatic activity this week, spear-headed by French President Emmanuel Macron, might point toward a broader de-escalation of the growing crisis. Macron visited Kyiv Tuesday to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy following marathon talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow that resulted in a glimmer of hope that Putin may be open to taking Western offers of diplomacy to end the crisis. Macron has said Putin assured him there would be no escalation around Ukraine, and French officials have since said they believe the visit has achieved a ""pause"" that allows de-escalation and gives more time for negotiations. With Russia continuing to move troops close to Ukraine, where it has already massed over 100,000, the hope expressed by Macron and Zelenskyy is that Thursday's talks can widen that diplomatic path and help bring down tensions. In Kyiv, both leaders spoke optimistically about Thursday's talks, saying they expected progress. The talks will be held between Ukraine's lead negotiator, Zelenskyy's top aide Andriy Yermak, and Dmitry Kozak, a deputy chief of staff to Putin. No breakthrough or even substantial progress is expected, but Western countries and Ukraine are pushing to reinvigorate the format to try to get Russia to engage or at least keep diplomacy going for now. Macron has said the talks should provide a ""clarification"" of what's possible. Macron has said making progress in the Ukraine talks should be combined with the launching of a separate dialogue with Russia on European security to address Kremlin concerns about NATO. It is still not clear if Macron's initiative means the Kremlin is ready to take a diplomatic exit. But it's hoped some positive steps at the talks could reduce the risk of military escalation. ""Unless Russia is serious about de-escalation, I think buying time is all we can hope for,"" a former adviser to Zelenskyy told ABC News. Russia's buildup has already reinvigorated the talks -- a round held in Paris two weeks ago was the first in two years and ended with the sides recommitting to a much-violated ceasefire. The Normandy talks are intended to negotiate the fulfillment of the so-called Minsk agreement, a peace deal that ended large-scale fighting in 2015, but which has been effectively stillborn since. The deal envisages Ukraine regaining control over the eastern separatist Donbas regions in return for granting them broad autonomy in its constitution. The talks have been deadlocked because Russia and Ukraine disagree over the order the agreement should be fulfilled. Russia demands that Ukraine first change its constitution to give the Russian-occupied regions special autonomous status and hold elections in them before it regains any control there. Ukraine says the separatists must disarm and Russian forces there leave before any elections to decide the regions' statuses can be held. Russia has pushed for Ukraine to reintegrate the separatist regions because it would give it a lever in Ukraine's government, and a de facto veto on Ukraine joining NATO or the European Union. For that reason, accepting the Minsk agreement on Russia's terms has become politically impossible for any Ukrainian government, which would face huge backlash at home. Most experts believe Russia is massing troops near Ukraine in part to try to force Kyiv into moving toward Moscow's interpretation of the Minsk agreement. But Ukraine's government has feared that in the face of the Russian military threat, Western countries might force it to make concessions. In Ukraine, there was media speculation Wednesday that Macron may have pressured Zelenskyy to make concessions in Thursday's talks, in particular to begin direct negotiations with the Russian-controlled separatists, the self-proclaimed People's Republics of Donetsk and Luhansk (DNR and LNR). If true, that would be politically explosive in Ukraine and would mean Macron had pushed Zelenskyy into a major concession. But Ukraine's foreign minister on Wednesday bluntly denied it would ever hold direct negotiations with the separatists. The minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said France understands Ukraine's ""red lines and do not demand to implement things that are not acceptable to Ukraine."" Kyiv refuses to negotiate with the separatist because it sees them as puppet governments controlled by Russia. Talking to the rebels directly would accord them recognition and also legitimize the Kremlin's false claim that the conflict in Ukraine is a civil war, in which Russia is not involved. Macron's office also denied it had pressured Ukraine. French officials said Thursday's talks would focus on how Ukraine can move toward introducing a draft law granting special status for the separatist areas and get comments on it from the separatists as an exception set out by the Minsk agreements. ""We are basically preparing to be able to put on the table all the practical options which will ultimately have to receive the approval not only of the Ukrainians, but of the Russians,"" the officials said. Oleksiy Semeniy, a former adviser to Ukraine's national security council and currently director of the Institute for Global Transformations in Kyiv, told ABC News on Wednesday he did not believe it was politically possible for Zelenskyy to start direct negotiations with the separatists. He said an important sign of success would be if it was announced following the talks that a leaders summit, involving Zelenskyy and Putin, would take place.",29,,,,21
2022-02-08,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/International/france-putin-promised-military-initiatives-ukraine-talks-macron/story?id=82741612,France says Putin promised no 'new military initiatives' near Ukraine in talks with Macron,"KYIV -- France's President Emmanuel Macron said on Tuesday Russian President Vladimir Putin had assured him there would be no ""escalation or deterioration"" of the crisis around Ukraine, as French officials said there were signs Putin was moving towards de-escalation. Macron said he obtained the assurances during the five hours of talks he held with Putin in the Kremlin in Moscow on Monday night. Following the talks, French officials said Putin had committed to not launch any new ""military initiatives"" and promised the thousands of Russian troops massed in Belarus to the north of Ukraine would leave after exercises ended there this month. Macron flew to Kyiv on Tuesday to meet with Ukraine's president Volodymyr Zelenskyy, where during a joint press conference afterwards he said Putin had told him he would ""not be the instigator of any escalation."" He said ""no one was naive"" but that he believed some progress had been made. “For me it was about arranging things to prevent an escalation and open up new avenues ... and that objective for me has been fulfilled,” Macron told reporters on the plane flying to Kyiv, according to AFP. If true, the commitment not to launch new military action could be an important sign may be closer to taking Western diplomatic offers as a road out of the crisis, where the Russian build up near Ukraine has sparked fears of invasion. But the Kremlin on Tuesday downplayed the French comments, denying that any deal had been reached. Spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that the Financial Times, which first reported the French claims, had “simply written incorrectly"" and that it was impossible for Putin and Macron to reach a deal since France was not the leader of NATO, which would need to accept any agreement. Peskov said Western countries for now were still ignoring Russia's key demands for security guarantees that Ukraine never join NATO, saying while grateful for Macron's efforts, “for now, of course, we can’t say we sense any real path to a resolution.” But Peskov did confirm the promise Russian troops will leave Belarus once the joint exercises there end on Feb. 20. “No one has ever said that Russian troops will remain on the territory of Belarus, that has never been a question,” Peskov told reporters. “On the conclusion of these exercises the troops will return to their place of permanent deployment."" Russia has been pouring trainloads of troops into Belarus amid its broader build up near Ukraine, alarming Western countries which fear they could be used as a cover for an attack. But Moscow and Minsk both insist the troops are there just for war games. Putin and Macron’s marathon talks in the Kremlin Monday had ended with a glimmer of hope the Russian leader is ready to accept diplomacy. Putin afterwards told a press conference that Macron had brought “a range of ideas,"" which he said it was too early to talk about publicly, but that Putin said he considered “possible as the basis for our next steps.” It was not clear what those ideas were. But French officials afterwards said Putin and Macron had agreed to “the initiation of a broader dialogue” on three key points: first, Russia’s military posture and second, the long-running ‘Normandy Format’ negotiations aimed at ending the conflict in Ukraine between government and Russian-backed separatists in the east. Third, the “opening of a dialogue on strategic issues,” a phrase that refers to troop and weapon deployments, and wider questions of NATO’s relationship with Moscow. Ukraine's Zelenskyy on Tuesday was also more sceptical of Putin's assurances, saying at the press conference with Macron: ""I do not really trust words, I believe that every politician can be transparent by taking concrete steps"". Russia has denied it has any plans to attack Ukraine, calling the Western accusations hysteria. But it has continued to build up troops near to Ukraine, with more forces arriving in recent days and, according to open source researchers, some appearing to move closer to the border. While massing troops near Ukraine, the Kremlin has demanded the United States and NATO give a binding guarantees on NATO membership and that the alliance pull back its infrastructure from eastern European countries that joined after the Cold War. The U.S. and NATO countries, including France, have rejected those as non-starters, but have offered to engage with the Kremlin on more modest security issues, including limits on missile deployments and troop exercises. Macron in front of Zelenskyy again affirmed NATO’s so-called ""Open Doors"" policy. Any diplomatic breakthrough would either have to find a creative way of reassuring the Kremlin on its main demands or for Putin to move back from them. Macron and Zelenskyy both denied a report that Macron had raised the idea of so-called 'Finlandization' as a possible solution. The term refers to Finland's neutral status during the Cold War where it remained outside NATO in return for the Soviet Union largely recognising its independence. Macron denied using the phrase or raising the concept with Putin, despite news reports he had told journalists it was one option ""on the table."" Zelenskyy said this was the first time he had heard of the idea and that he would never suggest ""Ukraine-izing"" other countries. Both men emphasised the importance of talks planned this Thursday in the so-called 'Normandy' group, that is mediated by France and Germany to try to end Ukraine's conflict with Russian-backed separatists in the country. The talks seek to unblock efforts to implement the 'Minsk agreement', which ended large-scale fighting in 2015 between Ukraine's government and the Russian-controlled rebels but has been largely deadlocked since. It is not clear how that has changed, but Macron and Zelenskyy both spoke positively about Thursday's talks, saying they hoped they would make progress. Zelenskyy said he hoped the talks would move the possibility of a full-scale summit between the leaders of the four countries closer. After meeting with Zelenskyy, Macron flew onto Berlin to meet with Germany's leader Olaf Scholz, who has just returned from Washington, where he met with President Joe Biden on Monday and discussed the crisis. Macron and Scholz afterwards said their ""common goal is to prevent war in Europe"" and Scholz, who has been criticised as being too reluctant to threaten painful sanctions on Russia if it attacks, said they were united in preparing to respond. ""Our appraisal of the situation is united, as is our position on this: Any further attack on the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine is unacceptable and will draw wide-reaching consequences for Russia -- politically, economically and geo-strategically,"" Scholz said.",29,,,,21

Pentagon press secretary John Kirby announced the imminent arrival of several thousand U.S. troops -- some already in Europe and some from the U.S. -- to NATO allies in eastern Europe at a Pentagon briefing Wednesday -- the first major movement of U.S. forces in response to concerns Russia will invade Ukraine. ""President Biden has been clear that the United States will respond to the growing threat to Europe's security and stability. Our commitment to NATO Article 5 and collective defense remains ironclad. As part of this commitment and to be prepared for a range of contingencies, the United States will soon move additional forces to Romania, Poland, and Germany,"" Kirby said. All of the troops would be under U.S. command. In a brief exchange with reporters Wednesday afternoon, President Joe Biden said the move was “totally consistent with what I told Putin in the beginning."" ""As long as he is acting aggressively,"" Biden said, ""we're going to make sure we can reassure our NATO allies and Eastern Europe that we're there and Article Five is a sacred obligation.” Russia called the deployments “destructive.” ""Destructive steps that are unjustified by anyone, they increase military tension and narrow the room for political decisions,” Russia’s deputy foreign minister, Alexander Grushko, said, according to the Russian news agency Interfax. The White House said the deployments were not in response to any specific, recent event. ""I would not read this as a decision made based on any events over the last 48 hours or a couple of days,"" White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Wednesday. ""We've been in discussion and under discussion with our partners and allies in the region where these troops are going for several weeks now.” Psaki said the United States was aiming to reassure allies, deter Russia and ""ensure we are ready for every contingency."" Kirby said he wanted to ""be very clear"" that ""these are not permanent moves."" ""They are moved designed to respond to the current security environment. Moreover, these forces are not going to fight in Ukraine. They are going to ensure the robust defense of our NATO allies,"" he said. A senior defense official had earlier confirmed to ABC News that about 3,000 U.S. troops will be given orders to deploy to Europe or, if they're already in Europe, to head to countries in eastern Europe. One of the units moving into eastern Europe from Germany is a fast-moving armored Stryker unit. ""It's important that we send a strong signal to Mr. Putin and frankly, to the world that NATO matters to the United States. It matters to our allies, and we have ironclad Article 5 commitments attack on one is an attack on all,"" Kirby said. The troop movements are separate from the 8,500 U.S. troops put on ""heightened alert"" to reinforce NATO's Response Force if needed -- and none would go to Ukraine. Pressed on what signal it sends that the U.S. is not waiting for a NATO vote to deploy an alliance force, Kirby said ""the signal that sends -- that we're that we're moving additional U.S. forces into allied territory, at the request and with the invitation of those countries -- is that we take our NATO commitments very, very seriously."" Kirby said 1,000 soldiers based in Germany will arrive in Romania in ""the coming days"" at the request of the country, augmenting the roughly 900 U.S. troops already in Romania. Another 2,000 troops from Fort Bragg in North Carolina will deploy to Europe, with 1,700 heading to Germany and about 300 to Poland, the White House said. ""The 82nd Airborne Division is deploying components of an Infantry Brigade Combat Team and key enablers to Poland. And the 18th Airborne Corps is moving a joint task force capable headquarters to Germany. Both of them, as you know, are based in Fort Bragg, North Carolina,"" Kirby said. The Pentagon spokesperson said that these moves could be ""preliminary,"" meaning more troops could be sent. He added that the 1,000 troops heading to Romania will be joining the country's own ""very capable"" military, and will also be joined by an unspecified number of French troops. Asked why the deployment is coming now, Kirby blamed Russian President Vladimir Putin who, he said, ""continues to add forces -- combined arms, offensive capabilities even over just the last 24 hours."" ""He has showed no signs of being interested or willing to de-escalate the tensions,"" Kirby said of the Russian leader. After last week saying the U.S. thought a Russian invasion was “imminent,” Psaki said Wednesday she no longer would use that word. Ukrainian officials had publicly disputed the fact that a Russian attack was “imminent” and even criticized the Biden administration for how it was describing the threat. A better way to describe the White House’s view about what Putin may do, Psaki said Wednesday, was that “he could invade at any time.” The U.S. still believes Putin has not made a decision about how to proceed, she said. Kirby emphasized the Biden administration does not believe conflict is inevitable. The announcement comes after Biden told reporters on Friday that he would be moving American forces ""in the near term."" Putin blamed the escalating tensions on the U.S. and the West for having ""ignored"" Russia's key demand that NATO bar Ukraine from joining the organization. The U.S. and NATO allies argue Russia is the aggressor, having already invaded Crimea and massing troops at the border. ABC News' Ben Gittleson and Max Karmen contributed reporting.",29,,,,19
2022-02-01,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/International/us-russia-agree-talking-amid-ukraine-crisis-putin/story?id=82600066,"US, Russia agree to keep talking amid Ukraine crisis but Putin claims concerns 'ignored'","The U.S. and Russia are moving ahead with their diplomatic engagements over Russia menacing Ukraine, according to senior State Department officials, after the two countries' top diplomats spoke Tuesday. But as talks continue, there have been no results yet -- with more than 100,000 Russian troops still massed on Ukraine's borders, including increasingly in its northern neighbor Belarus. Russian leader Vladimir Putin said the U.S. has ""ignored"" Russia's key demands that NATO bar Ukraine from joining and pull back allied troops from Eastern European countries -- his first comments on the crisis in over a month. But his government is still analyzing the U.S. response to Russia, laid out in a formal proposal hand-delivered by the U.S. ambassador in Moscow last week, he said. During a critical call Tuesday, Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov ""did agree that the ideas on both sides that have been exchanged did form the basis for the potential for serious discussion on a range of issues,"" said a senior State Department official. Those ideas include issues like arms control and greater transparency in military exercises, they added, expressing some hope that Russia's continued engagement could lay the groundwork for real negotiations. But for now, Russia is still formulating its response to those U.S. ideas, Lavrov said he told Blinken, calling those issues ""important in their own way, but secondary"" to Russia's key demands. Putin dug into NATO on Tuesday during a press conference with Viktor Orbán, the autocratic prime minister of NATO member Hungary. ""We have been promised by NATO that it will not advance its infrastructure one inch further eastwards. Everybody knows that. Today, we see where NATO is -- Poland, Romania, the Baltic States. They said one thing and did another thing. As the people say, they played us -- simply lied. OK, that's fine,"" the Russian leader said. U.S. officials have said that the U.S. and NATO never made promises not to expand eastward and that joining the Western military alliance is the decision of any individual country and NATO. But Putin for years has decried the alliance as threatening Moscow, even as Russia has invaded Ukraine and Georgia, illegitimately stationed troops in Moldova and conducted cyberattacks against the U.S., United Kingdom and others. He also accused Ukraine, ""fully packed of weapons,"" of seeking to join NATO to start a conflict with Russia over Crimea with NATO's backing. Crimea is the Ukrainian peninsula that Russia seized in 2014 -- a land grab the international community has not recognized -- as Russian forces fomented a conflict in Ukraine's eastern provinces known as Donbas. That's exactly the pretext for a renewed Russian attack on Ukraine that U.S. officials have said they're concerned Moscow is preparing. The heightened rhetoric from Putin was largely dismissed by the Biden administration Tuesday, with State Department spokesperson Ned Price saying, ""I will leave it to the Kremlinologists out there -- budding professional, amateur, or otherwise -- to read the tea leaves and try to interpret the significance of those remarks. For our part, we don't necessarily need to do that because we know that a formal response from the Russian Federation is forthcoming."" When that response is finalized, it will be sent to Putin for approval and then set to the U.S., the senior State Department officials said, and after that, Blinken and Lavrov plan to speak again. Pressed on whether the Russians may be buying time or stalling before a renewed attack on Ukraine, a second senior State Department official said, ""Because we don't President Putin has made a decision [on whether to further invade Ukraine], we think it's important to keep the diplomatic option on the table -- so to the extent that Russia wants to engage in that diplomatic track, we are also open to having that continued diplomatic engagement."" Blinken and Lavrov didn't agree on when or how those talks would continue, but the U.S. has called for them to include one-on-one meetings, as well as negotiations between NATO and Russia and dialogue at the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, a Cold War-era forum that includes the U.S., Russia, and Ukraine. On Monday, Moscow sent the U.S., as well as all OSCE members and several NATO allies, a similar letter seeking clarification about security principles enshrined in one of the OSCE's key documents, the Helsinki Final Act, according to U.S. and Russian officials. The letter was not Russia's response to the U.S. proposal, but seems to be part of its effort to formulate one. ""NATO refers to the right of countries to choose freely, but you can not strengthen someone's security at the expense of others,"" Putin said Tuesday during his press conference. ""This is a topic that we will not allow to be covered up. We will insist on a frank conversation and a frank explanation as to why the West doesn't want to fulfill its obligations or it wants to fulfil them selectively in its own favor,"" Lavrov added during an appearance after his call with Blinken. The U.S. has previously made clear it believes that Ukraine has a right to choose its own alliances and that the smaller, democratic country poses no threat to Russia's security. As the U.S. and NATO wait for that formal Russian response, Blinken again urged Russia to deescalate tensions by pulling back troops, heavy weaponry, and equipment from Ukraine's borders. But Lavrov gave no indication during the call that Russia would do so, the senior State Department officials said. ""All of the actions that we are seeing on the ground do not suggest escalation. We continue to see in fact more Russian troops coming not only to Russia's border with Ukraine, but as you know, also to Belarus for these supposed exercises,"" the second senior State Department official said. Russia and Belarus have said those forces are preparing for military exercises to improve their readiness. But the U.S. said Monday it has evidence that more than 30,000 Russian troops will mass in Belarus in the coming days, citing declassified U.S. intelligence -- a concerning move that puts them within two hours of Ukraine's capital Kyiv.",29,,,,19

The meeting didn't yield any action or even a joint statement, but ambassadors from the U.S. and Russia sparred in dueling remarks, trading blame for escalating the crisis. Russian leader Vladimir Putin has amassed over 100,000 troops and heavy equipment and weaponry on three sides of Ukraine, including in Russian-annexed Crimea and in Belarus, Kyiv's northern neighbor and a close Kremlin ally. At first, Russia, backed by China, tried to block the session from moving forward by calling a vote among Security Council's 15 member states. Russia and China opposed it, three countries abstained, but ten voted to move ahead with it. ""You heard from our Russian colleagues that we're calling for this meeting to make you all feel uncomfortable. Imagine how uncomfortable you would be if you had 100,000 troops sitting on your border in the way that these troops are sitting on the border with Ukraine,"" said U.S. ambassador to the U.N. Linda Thomas-Greenfield. ""This is not about antics. It's not about rhetoric. It's not about 'U.S. and Russia.' What this is about is the peace and security of one of our member states."" In her remarks, Thomas-Greenfield accused Russia of ""the largest -- hear me clearly -- mobilization of troops in Europe in decades"" and threatening military action should its concerns about Ukraine joining NATO and NATO's troop deployments in Eastern European member states not be addressed. ""If Russia further invades Ukraine, none of us will be able to say we didn't see it coming, and the consequences will be horrific,"" she added. But Russia's envoy again denied that the Kremlin is planning to attack its neighbor, a former Soviet state and now a growing democracy -- telling the Security Council there is ""no proof confirming such a serious accusation whatsoever,"" defending troop movements within Russia's borders as a domestic issue, and then denying there are 100,000 as U.S. and other Western officials have said. ""They themselves are whipping up tensions and rhetoric and are provoking escalation,"" Russian Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia said of the U.S. and its NATO allies. ""The discussions about a threat of war is provocative in and of itself. You are almost calling for this. You want it to happen. You're waiting for it to happen."" Thomas-Greenfield requested to speak again to respond, saying, ""I cannot let the false equivalency go unchecked, so I feel I must respond. ... The threats of aggression on the border of Ukraine -- yes on its border -- is provocative. Our recognition of the facts on the ground is not provocative."" Ukraine -- which is not a member of the Security Council, but was invited to participate -- urged Russia to respect its ""sovereign right"" to choose which countries it partners with. ""Ukraine will not bow to threats aimed at weakening Ukraine, undermining its economic and financial stability, and inciting public frustration. This will not happen. And the Kremlin must remember that Ukraine is ready to defend itself,"" Ukrainian Ambassador Sergiy Kyslytsya told the council. In a sign of their increasing alignment, China was the only country to back Russia's effort to squash the public meeting. Its ambassador Zhang Jun said they oppose ""microphone diplomacy of public confrontation"" and believed the open discussion of the issue would add ""fuel to the tension."" While the session didn't yield any results, it marks the start of another week of diplomacy between Russia and the U.S. and its allies over Ukraine. ""Russia heard clearly a united position from the vast majority of the council, and I hope that that will lead to a diplomatic solution,"" Thomas-Greenfield, a member of President Joe Biden's Cabinet, told reporters after the meeting. Biden himself hailed the meeting as ""a critical step in rallying the world to speak out in one voice: rejecting the use of force, calling for military de-escalation, supporting diplomacy as the best path forward."" On Tuesday, Secretary of State Antony Blinken will speak with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, the State Department and Russian Foreign Ministry confirmed Monday -- the first conversation after the U.S. responding in writing last week to Russia's demands about Ukraine and NATO. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is expected to speak to Putin this week, days after the U.K. said it could deploy troops to protect NATO allies if Russia invaded Ukraine. Biden announced a similar position last week, putting 8,500 U.S. troops on ""heightened alert"" and adding Friday he could do so in the ""near"" future. In a potential positive sign for diplomacy, Russia said some of its forces had pulled back from the border areas after a ""preparedness check,"" according to the Russian Armed Forces' Southern Military District. But it's not yet clear if the U.S. had confirmed any troops were withdrawn from the border region, and Thomas-Greenfield warned the U.S. has evidence Russia intends to expand its presence in Belarus to more than 30,000 troops -- putting them less than two hours north of Kyiv. Those deployments include short-range ballistic missiles, special forces, and anti-aircraft batteries, she added -- all of which Russia and Belarus have said are for military exercises.

2022-01-27,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/us-nato-military-moves-send-message-russia-ukraine/story?id=82462943,"US, NATO using military moves to send message to Russia over Ukraine","Wednesday's arrival of American F-15 fighters in Estonia to join an ongoing NATO air policing mission over the Baltics would normally not garner much attention were it not for the rising tensions of a possible Russian invasion of Ukraine. While the F-15's weeklong deployment to Estonia to join fighter jets from Belgium had been in the works for a while, Thursday's arrival in Lithuania of four Danish F-16 fighters for a similar mission was a more recent decision by Denmark tied to the rising tensions over Ukraine. Though small in scope, Denmark's deployment of the additional aircraft and a ship to the Baltic Sea sends a message to Russia about the willingness by NATO countries to demonstrate their military capabilities and commitment to NATO partners during a crisis. The deployments also highlight NATO's existing presence in eastern Europe and the Baltics, prompted by Russia's 2014 invasion of Crimea, and how any military movements are being viewed through the prism of the crisis with Ukraine, no matter the size of the deployment. Since Ukraine is not a member of NATO, the alliance has no security commitment to Ukraine should Russia invade, but it is intent on assuring the security of neighboring NATO countries. On Wednesday, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said that while diplomatic efforts continue to try to defuse the crisis with Russia ""we are also prepared for the worst."" Stoltenberg also said this week's announcement by the Pentagon that 8,500 troops in the United States had been placed on heightened alert demonstrated ""demonstrates the strength of the NATO alliance."" On Monday, the Pentagon announced that most of the troops had been placed on shortened ""prepare to deploy orders"" in case they were needed for the 40,000 man NATO Response Force was activated on short notice to respond to a crisis. . That same day Stoltenberg had detailed the movement of small numbers of ships, airplanes, and troops by Denmark and other NATO countries to eastern Europe and the Baltics. Ironically, it was Russia's 2014 takeover of Crimea that prompted NATO and the U.S. to initially rotate more robust military forces into eastern Europe and the Baltics. That includes Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland where in recent years NATO has positioned four battlegroups consisting of 4,000 multinational troops, including American forces. Separately Russia's annexation of Crimea led the United States to establish high-profile troop rotations in eastern Europe, currently there are 5,000 American forces carrying out training Poland. Both the U.S. and NATO have been very public with any new or potential military call-ups or deployments to message to Russia that the alliance remains strong and has the capability of quickly reinforcing member nations that request assistance. That messaging can include disclosing military planning and procedures that are not normally made public. The Pentagon's top spokesman acknowledged on Tuesday that publicly announcing that 8,500 American military on heightened alert and on shorter ""prepare to deploy orders"" was not customary for the U.S. military. ""It's not typical that we talk about it as much as we've been talking about it,"" John Kirby told reporters. Kirby also noted that the 8,500 troops on alert have not received orders to deploy and that the thousands of American troops already stationed in Europe were more likely to initially resource the NATO Response Force should it be activated. The public messaging about military readiness is in line with the very public warnings to Russia by President Biden and American allies that a Russian invasion of Ukraine would have severe economic consequences for Russia. ""Although ""strategic ambiguity"" is an essential part of our international diplomacy, in this case, Russia needed to have a strong and unified message from the U.S. and NATO,"" said Mick Mulroy a former deputy assistant of defense and an ABC News national security contributor. ""The Pentagon has also been very forthcoming on all its activities,"" he said. ""This is likely in an attempt to avoid any misinterpretation of their actions."" Mulroy that Russia should do the same particularly with more than 100,000 ground troops on Ukraine's borders. ""Without constant communication, this situation could lead to a conflict in which every nation involved, and even those that are not, is negatively impacted,"" he said.",29,,,,19
2022-01-26,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/russia-diplomacy-ukraine-ball-court-blinken/story?id=82485448,Russia maybe 'not serious' about diplomacy on Ukraine but ball in its court: Blinken,"Secretary of State Antony Blinken, speaking at the State Department on Wednesday, confirmed the U.S. had delivered a written response to Moscow security demands as Russia amassed troops on its borders with Ukraine. ""Today, Ambassador Sullivan delivered our written response in Moscow. All told, it sets out a serious diplomatic path forward, should Russia choose it,"" Blinken said. ""The document we’ve delivered includes concerns of the United States and our allies and partners about Russia's actions that undermine security, a principled and pragmatic evaluation of the concerns that Russia has raised, and our own proposals for areas where we may be able to find common ground,"" he continued. ""This is not a negotiating document,"" Blinken said, adding that President Joe Biden was ""involved from the get-go"" and had signed off on it. ""The ball is their court,"" he added, referring to the Russians. Russia had said it would not continue talks until Moscow had the responses in hand, and Blinken announced after meeting in Geneva last week with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov that the U.S. would oblige, which some argued might be seen as a U.S. concession. But Blinken denied that, saying the U.S. did not change its positions in the paper, but ""reiterated what we said publicly for many weeks and, in a sense, for many, many years."" That includes rejecting Russia's key demands, laid out in its own draft treaties last month, that NATO bar Ukraine from joining the Western military alliance and that NATO pull back troops from its Eastern European member states, who were formerly Soviet states. ""There is no change. There will be no change,"" he told reporters. ""I can't be more clear -- NATO's door is open, remains open, and that is our commitment."" Blinken and Lavrov will speak in the coming days once Russia has reviewed the U.S. response, the top U.S. diplomat said. While there are fears that Russia is using the diplomatic exchange as pretext to attack Ukraine, saying diplomacy failed to address their concerns, Blinken said the U.S. would not be the one to end talks, even as it prepares sanctions and readies NATO deployments. ""You may be right, that Russia is not serious about this at all. But we have an obligation to test that proposition, to pursue the diplomatic path,"" he said. ""The point is we're prepared either way."" Blinken's comments follow Biden saying Tuesday there could be some U.S. troop movements in the ""nearer term"" -- and that he would consider personally sanctioning Russian President Vladimir Putin if Russia invades Ukraine -- a day after 8,500 American forces were put on ""heightened alert"" in the region. But in Ukraine, leaders have offered a different assessment from that put forward by the White House that a full-scale Russian attack is imminent. During a news conference on Wednesday, Ukraine Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said they believe Russia’s forces are currently “insufficient” for a full-scale invasion and that right now the Kremlin is seeking to destabilize Ukraine with the threat of attack and other means, not yet actually launching one. In a televised address to the nation Tuesday night, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy urged people to stay calm about the threat of a Russian attack and said there was work in progress to bring about a meeting between him and the leaders of Russia, France and Germany. ""Protect your body from viruses, your brain from lies, your heart from panic,” Zelenskiy said. The White House and State Department have defended the administration's decisions and rhetoric, denying that drawing down the embassy, putting 8,500 U.S. troops on alert, and warning of an ""imminent"" threat have escalated the situation. Asked on Tuesday about the criticism from Kyiv that the U.S. is giving into Russia's playbook, State Department Spokesperson Ned Price denied the U.S. created a ""panic."" ""We have been clear about our concerns. We have been clear about the depth of those concerns,"" Price said. ""Given what we're seeing on Ukraine's borders, what we're seeing in what should be an independent sovereign country of Belarus, with the Russian military buildup there, what we're seeing with preparations for potential hybrid operations -- all of this is cause for concern, but certainly no one is calling for panic.""",29,,,,19

The hack of Global Affairs Canada, the government entity responsible for diplomatic and global relations, occurred on Wednesday, according to a statement provided by the Treasury Board to ABC News. The statement does not identify who carried out the cyberattack. As a result of the attack, some access the internet and internet-based services are not currently available, but mitigation measures were being taken to restore them. The Treasury Board said no other government department experienced a cyberattack. ""We are constantly reviewing measures to protect Canadians and our critical infrastructure from electronic threats, hacking, and cyber espionage. We encourage all government and non-government partners to use cyber security best practices,"" the statement says. The attack comes amid tensions over Ukraine and two days after the Canada Centre for Cyber Security warned malware was being used to target Ukrainian organizations. On Sunday, the Department of Homeland Security warned that the U.S. could be a target of Russian cyberattacks if the government responds to a possible Russian invasion of Ukraine.",3,,,,6

""We assess that Russia would consider initiating a cyber attack against the Homeland if it perceived a US or NATO response to a possible Russian invasion of Ukraine threatened its long-term national security,"" a DHS Intelligence and Analysis bulletin sent to law enforcement agencies around the country and obtained by ABC News said. The bulletin was dated Jan. 23, 2022. Russia, DHS said, has a ""range of offensive cyber tools that it could employ against US networks,"" and the attacks could range from a low level denial of service attack, to ""destructive"" attacks targeting critical infrastructure. ""We assess that Russia's threshold for conducting disruptive or destructive cyber attacks in the Homeland probably remains very high and we have not observed Moscow directly employ these types of cyber attacks against US critical infrastructure—notwithstanding cyber espionage and potential prepositioning operations in the past,"" the bulletin said. Last year, cybercriminals based in Russia caused two of the most destructive cyberattacks in recent memory, the U.S. has said. Colonial Pipeline was the victim of a ransomware attack in May 2021, shutting down operations and causing widespread outages across the country, and meat supplier JBS had its operations shutdown due to Russian based hackers. Russia is also responsible for the SolarWinds breach in late 202o, the U.S. has said, where the U.S. says Russian-backed cybercriminals gained access to 10 U.S. government agencies including the Department of Homeland Security and Department of Commerce. DHS says Russia ""continues to target"" and gain access to critical infrastructure in the United States, but Russia does not limit itself to conducting cyber operations just in the U.S. The bulletin says in 2015 and 2016, Russian military intelligence assets launched a cyberattack against Ukraine's power grid. Although the bulletin doesn't mention it, Ukrainian officials most recently pointed the finger at Russia for another cyber outage, shutting down government websites. The Department regularly shares information regarding a variety of issues, with federal, local and state partners, a DHS spokesperson said. ""We have increased operational partnerships between private sector companies and the federal government to strengthen our nation’s cyber defenses, including through CISA’s newly established Joint Cyber Defense Collaborative (JCDC),"" the spokesperson continued. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas told reporters last week that the United States is on a ""heightened alert"" for cyberattacks given ""geopolitical landscape."" He told reporters at the U.S. Conference of Mayors on Thursday that it is ""difficult to calibrate the likelihood"" of something happening. ""The whole point is, when the specter of harm arises, we call for vigilance and quite frankly, in the cybersecurity arena. ever present vigilance is what we call for,"" he said.",3,,,,6
2022-01-24,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/International/nato-put-forces-standby-amid-fears-russian-attack/story?id=82437821,NATO to put more forces on standby amid fears of Russian attack on Ukraine,"KYIV, Ukraine -- Amid deepening anxiety over a possible Russian invasion of Ukraine, the United States announced it's pulling out diplomats' families and some staff from its embassy in the country. Meanwhile, NATO announced it was putting extra forces on standby. As Russia continues to mass tens of thousands of troops close to Ukraine's borders, NATO said the alliance was sending a small number of ships and fighter jets to Eastern Europe to strengthen its ""deterrence"" presence there and reassure its eastern members, Denmark is sending a frigate to the Baltic Sea and four F-16 warplanes to Lithuania. At the same time, France is ready to send troops to Romania under NATO command, and Spain is considering deploying fighter jets to Bulgaria, NATO said in a statement. The Netherlands has agreed to send two F-35 jets to Bulgaria and has put a ship and land-based forces on standby for a NATO response force, officials said. ""NATO will continue to take all necessary measures to protect and defend all Allies, including by reinforcing the eastern part of the Alliance,"" NATO's Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said in a statement. The NATO announcement coincided with a report in The New York Times that the Biden administration may be preparing to send up to 5,000 American troops to Eastern European members of the alliance. The White House and the Pentagon have not confirmed the report, though the administration has previously said sending more U.S. troops to Eastern Europe is on the table if Russia attacks Ukraine. NATO on Monday said the ""United States has also made clear that it is considering increasing its military presence in the eastern part of the Alliance."" The steps to boost NATO's readiness came as the U.S. State Department announced Sunday it was ordering the families of its diplomats at its embassy in Ukraine's capital Kyiv to leave the country over security fears. The State Department said it has also authorized non-emergency staff at the embassy to depart voluntarily. The United Kingdom on Monday followed suit, with its Foreign Office saying some embassy staff and their dependents would be withdrawn ""in response to the growing threat from Russia."" Ukraine's government criticized the U.S. evacuation calling them ""premature"" and ""excessively cautious."" ""While we respect right of foreign nations to ensure safety & security of their diplomatic missions, we believe such a step to be a premature one & an instance of excessive caution,"" Oleg Nikolenko, a spokesman for Ukraine's foreign ministry, tweeted. Ukrainian officials are unhappy with the message the evacuations send by suggesting that a Russian invasion could be imminent. In general, they are much more skeptical that Russia is planning to launch a major attack and worry that western countries risk helping Moscow by exaggerating the risk and spreading panic. Privately, American officials acknowledge there is a gap between the Ukrainian and U.S. assessment of the level of threat. Speaking on condition of anonymity, a U.S. official told ABC News this weekend that Ukraine was ""p----- off"" over the evacuations. A senior State Department official on Sunday insisted the embassy drawdown did not undermine America's commitment to Ukraine, saying they were just ""prudent precautions"" given the heightened fear of a Russian attack. The official said the decision was ""based on this military buildup, based on how we see these developments,"" calling it the ""right moment."" Those leaving the embassy will do so on commercial flights, the State Department has said, indicating it is not an emergency evacuation. The State Department were scarred by the chaotic evacuation of Afghanistan, where thousands of Americans were stranded after the sudden Taliban takeover there caught the U.S. off guard. Officials are anxious to avoid a similar situation in Ukraine, should the worst happen. Russia has repeatedly insisted it has no intention of attacking Ukraine. However, its military buildup continues near Ukraine's eastern border and now in Belarus, where trainloads of Russian tanks and artillery have been arriving for joint exercises there. A top commander of Russian-controlled separatist rebels in eastern Ukraine on Monday also accused Ukraine's military of preparing to launch an offensive against the separatist areas. The U.S. and Ukraine are concerned that a false claim of a Ukrainian offensive against the separatists could be used as a pretext for Russia to launch an invasion. Eduard Basurin, the head of the militia of the separatists' self-declared 'People's Republic of Donetsk' (DNR), in local media warned it ""firmly recommends the enemy to give up its criminal intentions,"" promising the Ukrainian army ""will suffer irreparable damage, after which it will not be able to recover."" Ukraine's government has insisted it will not launch any offensive and there is no evidence Ukraine is preparing to.",29,,,,19
2022-01-21,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/biden-putin-meet-resolve-standoff-ukraine-blinken/story?id=82394819,"Biden, Putin might meet to resolve standoff over Ukraine, Blinken says","Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Friday that President Joe Biden and Russian President Vladimir Putin might meet in an effort to resolve the standoff over Ukraine and the threat of a Russian invasion. ""If it proves useful and productive for the two presidents to meet, to talk, to engage, to try to carry things forward, I think we're fully prepared to do that,"" Blinken said in Geneva, Switzerland, after holding talks with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov. There were no breakthroughs in their meeting, he said, but the two sides have agreed to return to their capitals and hold consultations before meeting again -- keeping the door to diplomacy open after weeks of heightened tensions over Russia's massive troop buildup near Ukraine's border. Later, speaking with ABC's George Stephanopoulos on ""Good Morning America"" -- asked whether it would take a summit to resolve the situation -- Blinken confirmed the U.S. was open to that idea. ""That's certainly something we're prepared to do. Right now, the plan is to take stock of where we are next week after we share some ideas with Russia,"" Blinken told ABC News. Those ideas will be a written response to Russia's two draft treaties, released publicly in December, where Moscow demanded that the U.S. and NATO bar Ukraine from joining the Western military alliance and pull troops back from Eastern European member states. Those two demands are ""nonstarters,"" U.S. officials have said, but after repeated Russian requests for a written response, Blinken confirmed Friday that the U.S. will provide one before he and Lavrov meet again. ""There are certain issues and fundamental principles that the United States and our partners and allies are committed to defend. That includes those that would impede the sovereign right of the Ukrainian people to write their own future. There is no trade space there - none,"" Blinken told reporters. That disagreement has left three previous rounds of talks last week to end inconclusively -- between the U.S. and Russia, NATO and Russia, and at the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. But Russia has dismissed more talks with European countries, instead seeking direct engagement with the U.S. -- and to create a rift between the U.S. and its NATO allies. Blinken said after Friday's high-stakes meeting that he would return to Washington to consult Biden, members of Congress, and allies and partners. ""Based on our discussion, I believe we can carry forward this work of developing understanding agreements together that ensure our mutual security, but that's contingent on Russia stopping its aggression toward Ukraine,"" he said. But that's unlikely to happen any time soon. Russia now has some 100,000 troops massed on three sides of Ukraine, including in Crimea, the peninsula it annexed in 2014, and Belarus, Ukraine's neighbor to the north where strongman Alexander Lukashenko has increasingly relied on Russian support to prop him up. Lavrov did not commit to pull those troops back, but said again that Russia is not going to attack Ukraine. He urged Blinken to focus on Russia's security proposals rather than the heightened tensions over Ukraine, he said at his own press conference afterwards. ""I haven't heard any point today that would justify the American position on what is happening on the Russian-Ukrainian border. Only concerns, concerns, concerns,"" Lavrov told reporters, calling the State Department's stated concerns about Russian actions ""blatant lies."" Despite that brusque tone, Blinken said the two sides left the meetings with a ""better understanding"" of each other's positions - calling it ""not a negotiation, but a candid exchange of concerns and ideas."" Whether that means Russia is engaging in good faith, or whether Putin still continue to destabilize Ukraine and even launch an attack, remains unresolved. ""It's ultimately going to be President Putin who decides what Russia will do,"" Blinken told ""Good Morning America.""",29,,,,0
2022-01-20,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/cia-foreign-actor-havana-syndrome-cases/story?id=82376545,CIA says foreign actor may be behind some Havana syndrome cases,"The CIA has assessed that the ""majority"" of reported cases of unexplained medical symptoms known as ""Havana syndrome"" can be ""reasonably explained by medical conditions or environmental and technical factors,"" a senior CIA official told ABC News. The spy agency has assessed it's ""unlikely that a foreign actor, including Russia, is conducting a sustained, worldwide campaign harming U.S. personnel with a weapon or mechanism,"" they added. But they left the door open to the possibility that some personnel have been attacked by a still-unknown actor or device, saying a foreign actor's role has not been ruled out ""in specific cases. We're still looking."" The issue has vexed U.S. officials for over five years now after the first incidents were reported by personnel at the U.S. embassy in Cuba. Since then, scores of cases have been reported on nearly every continent in over a dozen countries, especially after the CIA and State Department urged employees to come forward if they experienced symptoms. But it was never clear how many of those reports were later confirmed as medically diagnosed cases. In a rare statement, CIA Director Bill Burns said those symptoms are ""real,"" his agency's commitment to providing care for officers is ""unwavering"" and its investigation is ""not done."" ""We are pursuing this complex issue with analytic rigor, round tradecraft, and compassion and have dedicated intensive resources to this challenge,"" he said. ""While underlying causes may differ, our officers are suffering real symptoms."" In a note to all staff obtained by ABC News, Secretary of State Antony Blinken also offered strong support for employees and encouraged diplomats and their families to continue reporting potential incidents. ""Those who have been affected have real stories to tell -- their pain is real. There is no doubt in my mind about that,"" he wrote. But many of the affected personnel are outraged or upset by the CIA's assessment, with some like Marc Polymeropoulos, a retired CIA agent who was affected while on assignment in Moscow, fearing they will not be believed or will be ""mocked and vilified."" ""I remain grateful of the health care that Director Burns has agreed to provide for those who have been impacted, but now victims are being shamed and mocked,"" Polymeropoulos said, calling it ""a return to the early days of Havana where officers were not believed."" A declassified internal government watchdog report found that the State Department moved too slowly to address the issues when personnel first reported incidents and symptoms in November 2016. Symptoms have included headaches, dizziness, cognitive difficulties, tinnitus, vertigo and trouble with seeing, hearing, or balancing. Many officials have suffered symptoms years after reporting an incident while some have been diagnosed with traumatic brain injuries. Beyond Cuba, cases of what the Biden administration has called ""anomalous health incidents,"" or AHI's, have been reported in China, Austria, Germany, Vietnam, India, Uzbekistan and Colombia, among other countries. There have even been reports of incidents in the U.S., although the White House said the vast majority are overseas. But the CIA assessment found that ""previously undiagnosed illnesses, environmental factors, reporting out of an abundance of caution"" led to the majority of the cases, the senior official said. ""Many of the reports came in following growing workforce awareness of AHI's - after requests by departments and agencies for personnel to come forward,"" they added. ""This finding doesn't call into question at all the fact that our officers are reporting real symptoms and experiences. It's just that there's not one single cause that can be explained."" But after media reports emerged, some critics cast doubt again on whether U.S. personnel experienced anything at all, sparking anger in other corners that the CIA had undermined its personnel and those from other agencies. ""The CIA's interim conclusions are incredibly disappointing, insulting to those who are suffering, and highly suspect,"" whistleblower attorney Mark Zaid, who represents over a dozen affected employees, said in an email to ABC News. ""Once again, it is demonstrated that the failure of the government to produce a uniform, expert report only causes further controversy rather than resolution."" Zaid said the agency was ""more likely"" issuing it ""to allay a workforce which in recent months has been refusing overseas assignments in the wake of an overwhelming number of reported new cases among its ranks."" ""Other agencies [are] furious no coordination occurred & they disagree,"" he added in a tweet, calling the interim report ""disinformation."" ""It's not disinformation. That's absurd,"" the senior CIA official said in response, adding the assessment was conducted ""with the normal partners"" and through ""the intelligence community process."" Blinken also tried to address personnel's concerns about being believed. While he declined to address the assessment during a press conference in Berlin on Thursday, he told reporters employees ""have had real experiences, real symptoms, and real suffering, and we are going to continue to do everything we can with all the resources we can bring to bear to understand, again, what happened, why, and who might be responsible."" What is clear is that the report is preliminary. Lawmakers called for the CIA to continue to probe the issue, especially those cases that remain unexplained. ""Today's assessment, while rigorously conducted, reflects only the interim work of the CIA task force,"" said Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., chair of the Senate intelligence committee, which ""will continue pressing for answers on a bipartisan basis,"" he added. His Republican counterpart, ranking member Marco Rubio, R-Fla., reiterated that, saying the CIA ""must continue to make this issue a priority and seek answers to the causes of mysterious symptoms, including brain injury, and whether they can be attributed to the work of a foreign government or a specific weapon or device, particularly in a core group of cases."" It's unclear exactly how many cases are in that ""core group"" that remains under active investigation. The senior CIA official said that it numbers around a ""couple dozen"" and that it could still involve a ""foreign actor."" ""We're not ruling it out in specific cases. We're still looking,"" they said, but added, ""There are no patterns or linkages at this stage."" Russia had long been suspected in some circles as being behind the incidents, but it's unclear how or with what device such an attack would be possible. Blinken said last week that he and other U.S. officials have raised the issue with the Russians even without clear attribution. Asked whether he would raise the issue with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov when they meet Friday, Blinken declined to comment Thursday.",3,,,,8
2022-01-18,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/extremely-dangerous-moment-top-us-diplomat-travels-ukraine/story?id=82329712,"In 'extremely dangerous' moment, top US diplomat travels to Ukraine, to meet Russian counterpart","Secretary of State Antony Blinken is traveling to Ukraine, Germany, and Switzerland this week - a sign ""perhaps that diplomacy is not dead,"" a senior State Department official said Tuesday. As Russia continues to mass troops and military equipment near Ukraine's borders, including now in allied Belarus, the U.S. and European countries have become increasingly concerned the Kremlin may be preparing to launch an attack on Ukraine. But Blinken will meet his Russian counterpart, Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, in Geneva on Friday, keeping the door to diplomacy open. ""This is an extremely dangerous situation. We're now at a stage where Russia could at any point launch an attack in Ukraine,"" White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Tuesday -- a sharp rise in the United States' rhetorical warnings that Russian lead Vladimir Putin may attack his neighbor. Before sitting down with Lavrov, Blinken will meet Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy and Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba in his second visit to Kyiv as secretary - one week after CIA Director Bill Burns visited - and travel to Berlin for a summit with his German, French, and British counterparts. Months of Russian troop buildups and bellicose rhetoric led to a series of high-stakes diplomatic meetings last week. But the one-on-one U.S.-Russia talks, a summit between NATO and Moscow, and a meeting of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe ended inconclusively. Putin laid out his demands in two draft treaties last month, including that Ukraine be barred from joining NATO and that the Western military alliance pull its troops out of Eastern European member states. But for weeks, the U.S. and NATO have called those nonstarters, instead offering to negotiate on other issues like arms control or military exercises and threatening massive sanctions if Russia attacks Ukraine. Russia has denied that it plans to invade Ukraine, where its troops have led eastern forces in a war against the government for eight years now and continue to occupy the peninsula Crimea. It has warned that if its demands aren't met, it will respond with ""military technical"" measures. Rather than tensions defusing, the threat of conflict seems to be rising, engineered by Russian moves. The Kremlin has begun moving troops into Belarus, Ukraine's neighbor to the north, for military exercises next month, including troops from its far east, Russia's Defense Ministry confirmed Tuesday, saying the exercises were designed to prepare Russian and Belarusian forces to ""thwart and repel a foreign aggression."" ""This is neither an exercise nor normal troop movement,"" the senior State Department official told reporters. ""It is a show of strength designed to cause or give false pretext for a crisis as Russia plans for a possible invasion."" A second senior State Department official went further later on Tuesday, calling into question whether the Belarusian government of strongman Alexander Lukashenko is really in charge and accusing the Kremlin of ""preying"" on his vulnerabilities with this ""concerning"" troop deployment. ""Over time, Lukashenka has relied more and more on Russia for all kinds of support, and we know that Putin doesn't give that support for free. ... There is no escaping that having dedicated his 27 years in office to claiming to be the guarantor of Belarus's sovereignty and independence, Lukashenka has increasingly shown that he will trade it all in order to stay in power,"" the senior official said. The bold accusation seems to be a sign of deep U.S. concern that Putin is making another power move here - this time to deepen his influence in Belarus. But the U.S. clearly sees it as a way for Moscow to more easily attack Ukraine, too - with Kyiv hundreds of miles closer to Belarus's borders than to Ukraine's eastern border with Russia. The deployment gives ""increased capability for Russia to launch this attack - increased opportunity, increased avenues, increased routes"" against Ukraine, the second senior State Department official said. Last Friday, the White House also said the U.S. had intelligence that Russia had positioned operatives trained in urban warfare and explosives for a possible ""false-flag"" operation that could also been used as pretext for an invasion - something the Kremlin denied as ""complete disinformation."" Blinken and Lavrov spoke Tuesday and agreed to meet Friday in Geneva, where U.S. and Russian delegations met last week. Their meeting will be another attempt to deescalate tensions, but it's unclear what new ground there is to tread. ""It is still too early to tell if the Russian government is genuinely interested in diplomacy, if it is prepared to negotiate seriously in good faith, or whether it will use discussions as a pretext to claim that diplomacy didn’t address Moscow’s interest. I just can’t judge that now, but I do understand the desire on our side to test that hypothesis,"" the first senior State Department official said. Before traveling to Switzerland, Blinken will be hosted by Zelenskiy in Kyiv, days after a bipartisan delegation of U.S. lawmakers visited and vowed continued U.S. support too, including arms. ""As we speak there are additional U.S. supplies that are being sent to Ukraine to make sure that they have what they need to fight back,"" Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., told ABC News. Blinken's visit comes on the heels of CIA Director Burns's last week, a senior U.S. official confirmed to ABC News. Burns also met with Zelenskiy and with his intelligence counterparts to discuss current assessments of the risk to Ukraine, the official said. In between Kyiv and Geneva, Blinken will meet German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock for the second time this month, with the new German government critical to the strength of any potential sanctions if Russia invades. Blinken and Baerbock will also meet their French and British counterparts in a show of diplomatic solidarity. There had been some signs of cracks in that unity, however, especially over the Nord Stream 2 pipeline. The project would bring natural gas from Russia to Germany, sidestepping Ukraine and removing a key source of revenue for Kyiv, which has pressed the U.S. to sanction the German company constructing it. But Biden has refused to do so, saying relations with Germany would suffer. Amid intense international pressure, Germany's new chancellor Olaf Scholz indicated Tuesday that he would be prepared to halt the pipeline if Russia attacks Ukraine - another signal of the costs Moscow would face if it moved ahead. ""If Russia does launch an attack on a sovereign country that borders NATO countries, it is likely that NATO will significantly increase its military activities, funding, and even membership - everything Russia claims to be trying to avoid,"" said Mick Mulroy, former deputy secretary of Defense and a retired CIA paramilitary officer. That could include Nord Stream 2's end and increased U.S. arms and training to Ukraine, too - with Mulroy adding, ""Russia could end up in a prolonged counterinsurgency campaign in Ukraine, which they will soon regret.""

2022-01-15,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/International/talks-make-progress-russian-attack-ukraine-analysis/story?id=82273678,"After talks make no progress, is Russian attack on Ukraine more likely?: Analysis","A week of high-profile diplomatic talks between the West and Russia have not dispelled fears that Russia may be preparing to attack Ukraine. Experts, who for months have been trying to understand whether Russia's troop buildup near Ukraine is a negotiating ploy or preparations for a real attack, say the question appears to have become: will Putin use force or not? On Friday, the Biden administration intensified its alarms, warning it believes Russia is ""preparing for an invasion of Ukraine…should diplomacy fail to meet their objectives."" The White House accused Russia of ""pre-positioning"" operatives to be ready to stage a ""false-flag operation"" in eastern Ukraine that would justify a Russian attack. Russia has denied it is preparing to attack Ukraine, but has threatened it may use unspecified ""military technical measures"" if its demands are not met. The concern is that after massing tens of thousands of troops near Ukraine over the last year, Russia in December made extraordinary demands, insisting on security guarantees that NATO will never allow Ukraine to become a member and that the alliance pull back troops from eastern European countries that joined after the Cold War. It made the demands in two draft ""treaties"" handed to the Biden administration and NATO. The U.S. and NATO called the demands a non-starter. But in the three sets of talks this week, Russia did not budge from its core demands. Again and again, its negotiators repeated it will accept nothing less than the NATO security guarantees. While expressing interest in the U.S. offers to discuss arms control, Russian officials said it was impossible to make progress on those areas without the guarantees. The U.S. and NATO in the talks were equally uncompromising in rejecting those guarantees, saying they cannot yield on core principles. The talks seem at an impasse. Russia's lead negotiator, deputy foreign minister Sergey Ryabkov, on Thursday said the efforts had approached a ""dead-end."" Russia's foreign minister Sergey Lavrov has said it is now waiting for written responses from the U.S. to Russia's treaties, after which Putin will decide next steps. The U.S. as well as some analysts have worried Russia was engaging in the talks all along with the expectation they would fail, allowing it to then claim it had no choice to use force after diplomacy failed. Some now said the talks' outcome proved that was the case. It is also possible that the consequences the Kremlin has referred to could be less than an attack on Ukraine, such as deploying missiles closer to Europe, or making its military build up near Ukraine more permanent. Ryabkov in an interview Thursday even refused to rule out deploying Russian weapons to Cuba or Venezuela, something the U.S. quickly dismissed as ""bluster."" But independent analysts say Russia is continuing to build up its forces near Ukraine. Open source researchers this week said there is evidence troops and equipment from units based in Russia's far east are now moving west. Conflict Intelligence Team, an open source group that tracks Russian military movements, said it has found a growing number of videos posted to social media that appeared to show long trains carrying tanks and other military vehicles traveling through eastern towns. Rob Lee, an analyst based at Kings College London's Department of War Studies, told ABC News on Thursday equipment that was being moved. ""It doesn't look routine,"" Lee said. ""It doesn't make that much sense that you'd see this many videos of things moving unless there was something else going on."" He said it was impossible to say definitively yet whether the Russian forces' destination was the border with Ukraine, but added that was ""the most likely explanation."" Most analysts have said they still don't believe Putin has made a final decision on whether to launch an attack. But what comes next seems to be in the Russian president's hands. ""For the moment, the next step is up to Putin,"" Lawrence Freedman, a professor also at the Kings College War Studies Department wrote in a post Friday. After this week's talks, it appears diplomacy seems to have failed to satisfy the Kremlin's objectives.",29,,,,27
2022-01-14,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/International/ukraine-massive-cyberattack-hits-government-websites/story?id=82262888,Ukraine says 'massive cyberattack' hits government websites,"Ukraine said Friday a “massive cyber attack” has knocked offline the websites of most of its government ministries. The websites of the government’s cabinet office, the foreign ministry, emergency services minister, as well as the ministries of energy, education, agriculture and several others, were down on Friday, according to Ukrainian media. The country’s public services platform Diia, which holds Ukrainians’ tax numbers and COVID-19 vaccination certificates, was also hit. A message was posted on the targeted websites reading, “Ukrainians! All your personal data will be uploaded onto the general web. All data on your computer will be destroyed, it will be impossible to restore them. All your information will become public, be afraid and expect the worse. This is for your past, present and future.” Ukraine’s government has not said who is behind the attack. It comes amid fears of a Russian invasion of the country, as Moscow has massed around 100,000 soldiers at the border, and follows warnings from Ukraine and the United States that Russia might launch cyberattacks amid the tensions. A day earlier, talks between Moscow and NATO countries aimed at averting a possible Russian military attack concluded with no progress, with Russia saying they were reaching a “dead-end.” Ukraine’s government did not say whether the attack had caused damage beyond taking down the websites. “As a result of a massive cyber attack, the websites of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and a number of other government agencies are temporarily down,” Ukraine’s foreign ministry said. “Our specialists are already working on restoring the work of IT systems, and the cyber police opened an investigation.” The message posted on the affected websites included a list of historical grievances. “This is for your past, present and future. For Volyn, for the OUN UPA [Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists/Ukrainian Insurgent Army], for Halychyna, for Polissya and for historical lands,” it read. The two groups named in the post refer to Ukrainian nationalist partisan fighters that collaborated with the Nazis during the Second World War. Russia frequently accuses Kyiv’s government of embracing fascist groups. On Friday, the European Union’s top foreign policy official, Josep Borrell, said the bloc’s political and social committees as well as its cyber units would meet to try to assist Ukraine. “We are going to mobilize all our resources to help Ukraine to tackle this cyberattack. Sadly, we knew it could happen,” Borrell was quoted as saying by Reuters at an E.U. foreign ministers meeting in Brest, France. “It’s difficult to say [who is behind it]. I can’t blame anybody as I have no proof, but we can imagine.” Russian officials on Thursday suggested the talks with the U.S. and NATO countries this week were at an impasse, since Western countries are refusing to accept Moscow’s key demands for binding guarantees that Ukraine will never join NATO and that the alliance pull back troops from eastern European countries that joined after the Cold War. The U.S. and NATO have rejected those demands as “non-starters.” Russia’s lead negotiator, deputy foreign minister Sergey Ryabkov, on Thursday said he saw no grounds for more talks in the near future as long as the U.S. and NATO were refusing Moscow’s key demands. But Russia’s foreign minister Sergey Lavrov has said the country will now wait for written responses from the U.S. and NATO, which it expects next week, before deciding next steps. Russia has denied it has any plans to attack Ukraine. It warned that if the U.S. and NATO fail to give security guarantees, it will take alternative measures that will have unspecified consequences for European security. Lavrov on Friday told reporters that Russia would not wait endlessly for the U.S. to accept Russia’s security demands on NATO. “Our patience is at an end,” he said at a pre-scheduled press conference in Moscow",29,,,,21
2022-01-12,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/International/nato-rejects-russian-demands-security-guarantees-latest-round/story?id=82226913,NATO rejects Russian demands for security guarantees in latest round of talks,"A new round of talks between Russia and NATO countries aimed at averting a possible Russian invasion of Ukraine have again ended with little progress, with the two sides still at an impasse over Russia's demands for security guarantees. Russia met with 30 NATO member states at the alliance's headquarters in Brussels on Wednesday, the second of three diplomatic meetings organized this week in Europe between Russia and Western countries amid fears raised by Russia's massing of 100,000 troops on Ukraine's border. In Wednesday's talks, NATO offered Russia to hold a series of meetings to discuss arms control and other confidence building measures in an attempt to persuade it to lower tensions around Ukraine. The alliance's secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said it had proposed talks on limiting missile deployments and troop exercises as well as how to improve communication and transparency. He told reporters afterward that Russia said it needed to time to consider the offer, but it had not rejected it out of hand. ""We are ready to sit down,"" Stoltenberg told journalists. ""And we hope Russia is ready to sit down and hold these meetings."" But NATO unanimously rebuffed Moscow's core demands for formal guarantees that Ukraine will never join NATO and that the alliance will pull back its forces from countries in Eastern Europe that joined after the Cold War. Russia and the United States held talks on Monday in Geneva where Moscow pressed those demands and which the U.S. rejected as impossible. NATO and the U.S. said they would never compromise on what they called the alliance's ""core principles,"" after Russia's negotiators, Deputy Foreign Minister Alexander Grushko and Deputy Defense Minister Alexander Fomin, presented the same demands again at Wednesday's meeting. ""Together, the United States and our NATO allies made clear we will not slam the door shut on NATO's open-door policy,"" U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman, who led the U.S. delegation, said after the meeting, calling them a ""non-starter."" But while Russia's key demand was again rejected, the door to a diplomatic solution remains open, U.S. and NATO officials said. ""There was no commitment to deescalate, nor was there a statement that there would not be,"" Sherman added, even offering some praise for the Russian delegation for sitting ""through nearly four hours of a meeting where 30 nations spoke -- and they did -- which is not an easy thing to do. I'm glad they did it."" She and Stoltenberg said Russia now had a choice to make whether to engage with dialogue, saying she hoped the Russian negotiators would now go back to President Vladimir Putin and they would choose ""peace and security."" Russia made the sweeping demands over NATO in two draft treaties in December after building up troops close to Ukraine for months. That buildup, along with bellicose rhetoric and plans for ""internal sabotage,"" according to U.S. officials, raised fears that Putin may be preparing to launch a renewed attack on the country after he seized Crimea and launched a separatist war in 2014. Russia has denied it is planning to attack Ukraine, despite the buildup on its border. Amid the diplomatic efforts, it staged live fire exercises on Tuesday with 3,000 troops and hundreds of tanks in three regions neighboring Ukraine. The U.S. and NATO have hoped that Russia might accept more modest offers, such as limiting missile deployments and troop exercises. But Russia's negotiator, Grushko, insisted again Wednesday that Russia could accept nothing less than the guarantees on Ukraine and NATO, calling it ""imperative."" No progress on arms control or confidence-building measures could be made without progress on Moscow's core demands, he told reporters afterward. Grushko said Russia was now waiting for NATO and the U.S. to send written responses to the Russian proposals and that it would then make a decision on how to proceed. Russia has complained for decades about NATO expansion into countries formerly dominated by Moscow under the Soviet Union. The Kremlin now alleges that NATO assistance to Ukraine means the former Soviet country is becoming a defacto part of the alliance. The U.S. and NATO say Moscow's demand is an attempt to reimpose its Soviet-era sphere of influence on Eastern Europe and that it violates a fundamental right for countries to choose their security alliances. Grushko said deescalation was ""absolutely possible,"" but he warned that the alliance's enlargement into Eastern Europe had become ""unbearable"" for Russia, warning if Russia felt threatened it would use ""military means."" ""We have a range of military-technical measures that we will use if we will feel a real threat to our security,"" Grushko said. ""And we already are feeling it, if they are looking at our territory as a target for guided, offensive weapons. Of course, we cannot agree with that. We will take all necessary measures in order to fend off the threat with military means, if political ones don't work."" But Grushko also spoke positively about the talks, saying for the first time he believed Russia had ""managed to convey to the members of the alliance that the situation is unbearable."" Stoltenberg said Russia could not have a veto over Ukraine joining the alliance, saying Russian claims to feel threatened by Ukraine were also wrong. ""Ukraine is a sovereign nation. Ukraine has the right to self-defense,"" he said. ""Ukraine is not a threat to Russia. To say that Ukraine is a threat to Russia is to put the whole thing upside down."" Western officials have been trying to understand whether the threat of a Russian attack on Ukraine is real or a bluff to strengthen Moscow's hands as it makes its demands. Sherman suggested that remained an open question, perhaps even for the Kremlin itself. ""Everyone, Russia most of all, will have to decide whether they really are about security, in which case they should engage, or whether this was all a pretext,"" she said. ""And they may not even know yet."" While the buildup, including the new live-fire exercises Wednesday, could still be a negotiating tactic, some Western officials and independent experts also worry that Russia might be engaging in the talks intending for them to fail, so as to use that as a pretext for a military intervention. ""The United States and our allies and partners are not dragging our feet. It is Russia that has to make a stark choice: deescalation and diplomacy, or confrontation and consequences,"" Sherman said. ""If Russia walks away, however, it will be quite apparent they were never serious about pursuing diplomacy at all."" On Thursday, the talks will move to a third round at the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, a Cold War-era forum that includes all of the continent's countries, the U.S. and Canada and several in Central Asia. Those talks are expected to yield even fewer results, with 57 member states participating in an open dialogue. The Kremlin has suggested it will make a decision whether it is worth continuing talks following this week's meetings. Putin's spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, on Tuesday said Moscow did not ""see a substantial reason for optimism"" so far but that for now it was not drawing any conclusions.",29,,,,21
2022-01-10,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/us-russia-talks-end-progress/story?id=82180475,"US, Russia talks end with 'no progress': Here's what you need to know","U.S. and Russian officials held over seven hours of talks Monday, but the two sides did not negotiate or appear any closer to a resolution over heightened fears that Russia will attack its neighbor Ukraine. In dueling press conferences after the talks, the top U.S. and Russian diplomats said their meetings were constructive, as they now move on to a second round at NATO's headquarters on Wednesday. But while U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman urged caution and praised the ""frank and forthright"" tone, her counterpart, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov, warned the U.S. is moving too slowly and not taking seriously Moscow's key demands. Whether that sets the stage for genuine negotiations, or whether Russian leader Vladimir Putin is seeking a pretext for war, remains unclear, as Russia pushes to reclaim its Soviet sphere of influence and present its clearest, most fundamental challenge to European security in three decades. Ryabkov said it is impossible for any progress to be made until the U.S. gives legal guarantees Ukraine and Georgia will never join NATO. ""We are fed up with loose talk, half promises. Ukraine and Georgia will never -- never ever -- become members of NATO,"" Ryabkov told reporters afterward, reiterating Russia's top demand, laid out last month in two draft treaties. ""We do not trust the other side. We need ironclad, waterproof, bullet-proof, legally binding guarantees. Not safeguards -- guarantees."" He has said ""no progress"" was made on Russia's central demands and warned the U.S. is failing to understand the urgency of the situation. Even as he denied the approximately 100,000 Russian troops on three sides of Ukraine's borders are preparations for an invasion, Ryabkov again warned Ukraine could spark conflict with a ""provocation,"" ""Enough is enough. The station now is so dangerous and so precarious that we cannot afford any further delays,"" he added. But Sherman made clear that the U.S. will not bend on what it sees as a key principle -- that countries like Ukraine can make their own decisions about joining an alliance. Instead, she said the U.S. offered ""preliminary ideas"" on how to ease tensions and promote transparency between the world's two largest nuclear powers, including reducing missile deployments or military exercises. ""We certainly urged Russia to deescalate, to create an environment that is conducive to the diplomatic track, but we will see,"" she told reporters, While the two sides gained ""a better understanding of each other and each other's priorities and concerns,"" she said, they weren't engaged in negotiations just yet: ""We're not at a point where we're ready to set down texts and begin to go back and forth."" ""We must give diplomacy and dialogue the time and space required to make progress on such complex issues,"" she added, saying the U.S. would ""move as expeditiously as we possibly can,"" but that, ""Negotiations on complex topics like arms control cannot be completed in a matter of days or even weeks."" In contrast, Ryabkov struck a tone of urgency, adding, ""In the coming days there will be more full clarity whether another round will take place, if yes, in what format."" After the NATO-Russia meeting Wednesday, there will be a third round of talks Thursday at the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, a Cold War-era forum that has deployed a war monitor in eastern Ukraine as Russian-led forces battle the Ukrainian government. That war, which has killed approximately 14,000 people and counting, is one way Moscow continues to destabilize its neighbor Ukraine, a former Soviet state that has sought closer ties to the West since protests toppled a pro-Russian oligarch president in 2013. After that revolution, Russia seized Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula and launched the war in the eastern provinces known as Donbas. But the movement of approximately 100,000 Russian troops, along with heavy equipment, has sparked deep concerns about a possible full-scale invasion. Sherman said Monday it was still unclear what Putin had decided but called on Russia to return those forces to their barracks away from Ukraine's borders. Russia has complained for decades about NATO’s expansion to include countries that Moscow dominated as the Soviet Union. Now it has argued that Ukraine has moved too close to the alliance, arguing that NATO military advisors and equipment provided to help Ukraine defend itself in its war with Russia mean it is becoming a de-facto part of it. In 2008, NATO adopted a resolution that stated Ukraine and Georgia would one day become part of the alliance, but there is little support among Western countries for that to happen quickly. Russia views having forced the U.S. to talk about its concerns around Ukraine is an important victory in itself. Ryabkov at the talks suggested that had given grounds for some optimism. ""I don’t consider the situation hopeless,” he continued. “I think the usefulness of the talks in Geneva is mainly that, for the first time, we were able to talk about issues that before existed, but as if behind the scenes.” But he said Russia wants NATO to use its next summit in Madrid this year to renounce the 2008 resolution that opened a path for Ukraine and Georgia to join, a demand that has been seen as a non-starter by the U.S. The U.S. has floated ideas to increase transparency and reduce suspicions between the two sides, including reductions on the deployment of nuclear missiles and other weapons -- although Sherman said the U.S. will not negotiate on the deployment of its forces in Europe, saying it's an issue for only the U.S. and its allies to discuss. ""We will go through all of the discussions this week. We will reflect on them all. I expect that incorporating those, talking with our partners and allies at NATO, at OSCE -- we will then have further conversations with the Russian government and decide on the best way forward,"" she said. For Russia, however, that rejection of NATO membership for Ukraine and Georgia, another former Soviet state where Russian forces currently occupy parts of the country, does not bode well for a diplomatic solution. The question is: If the U.S. and NATO hold firm on that line, will Moscow accept anything else instead, or will its forces attack? An agreement is still ""possible,"" Ryabkov said, but ending NATO's expansion is ""an absolute imperative.""",29,,,,21

""There are confidence-building measures, there are risk-reduction measures, all of which, if done reciprocally, I think can really reduce tensions and address concerns,"" Blinken told told ABC ""This Week"" anchor George Stephanopoulos. And after Russia sent troops to help quell unrest in neighboring Kazakhstan, Blinken did not rule out that events there could come up in talks -- even though Russia has ruled that out. He criticized Kazakhstan's president ordering security forces to shoot to kill protesters. ""That is something I resolutely reject,"" Blinken said. ""The shoot-to-kill order, to the extent it exists, is wrong and should be rescinded."" Delegations from the U.S. and Russia planned to hold talksSunday night and Monday in Geneva, kicking off a critical week of diplomacy between Moscow and the West over Russian President Vladimir Putin menacing neighboring Ukraine. Blinken said it may be possible ""to address whatever legitimate concerns Russia may have."" For example, he said, ""there may be grounds for renewing"" the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty with Russia, from which the Trump administration withdrew and which the U.S. accuses Russia of violating. ""Similarly, there are agreements on the deployment of conventional forces in Europe, on things like the scope and scale of exercises, that, if adhered to reciprocally -- that is, Russia makes good on its commitments, which it's repeatedly violated -- then there are grounds for reducing tensions, creating greater transparency, creating greater confidence, all of which would address concerns that Russia purports to have,"" Blinken said. Stephanopoulos pressed, ""So you're willing to address troop levels, you're willing to address missile deployments, you're willing to address training exercises?"" Blinken said the United States was ""not looking at troop levels."" ""When it comes to the deployment of forces and troop levels, we're not looking at troop levels,"" he said. ""To the contrary, if Russia commits renewed aggression against Ukraine, I think it's a very fair prospect that NATO will reinforce its positions along its eastern flank, the countries that border Russia. ""But when it comes to, for example, the scope and scale of exercises,"" he continued, ""things that were dealt with in the conventional forces in Europe treaty that Russia's been in violation of, those are things that we can look at."" The U.S.-Russia negotiations are expected to be followed by talks between Russia and NATO in Brussels on Wednesday and more discussions between the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe in Vienna on Thursday. The U.S. will participate in those talks, too. As President Joe Biden has threatened in the past, Blinken promised ""massive consequences"" for Russia if it invades Ukraine -- promising they would go beyond those that the West imposed on Russia after it annexed Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula in 2014 -- saying the U.S. and European allies have coordinated on ""economic, financial and other consequences."" But when asked by Stephanopoulos whether he thinks Putin has already made the decision to take control of the Ukraine, Blinken noted he wasn’t sure yet. ""It's clear that we've offered him two paths forward,"" Blinken said. ""One is through diplomacy and dialogue. The other is through deterrents and massive consequences for Russia if it renews its aggression against Ukraine. And we're about to test the proposition of which path President Putin wants to take this week."" And the secretary of state tempered expectations about quick results. ""I don't think we're going to see any breakthroughs next week,"" Blinken said. It would be ""very difficult"" to ""make actual progress,"" he said, as long as ""there's an ongoing escalation, when Russia has a gun to the head of Ukraine with 100,000 troops near its borders, the possibility of doubling that on very short order."" ""If we're seeing de-escalation, if we're seeing a reduction in tensions, that is the kind of environment in which we can make real progress and, again, address concerns, reasonable concerns on both sides,"" Blinken said.",29,,,,10
2022-01-09,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/week-us-russia-diplomatic-talks-kick-off-amid/story?id=82134600,Week of US-Russia diplomatic talks kick off amid Ukraine tension,"Delegations from the U.S. and Russia will hold talks Monday, kicking off a critical week of diplomacy between Moscow and the West over Russian President Vladimir Putin menacing neighboring Ukraine. Ahead of the negotiations, a senior Biden administration official said the United States was open to discussing limits on missile deployments and troop exercises in Europe. For weeks now, Russia has massed nearly 100,000 troops along Ukraine's borders and sharpened its rhetoric to blame Kyiv, the U.S., and NATO for provoking a conflict -- heightening fears in Washington and beyond that Putin is laying the pretext for a full-scale invasion. Russia has denied that, but under the threat of war, it has issued a list of demands in two draft treaties last month that would remake Europe with greater Russian influence -- its most profound challenge to the post-Cold War landscape in three decades. While U.S. officials have said many are nonstarters, like barring Ukraine from NATO membership, President Joe Biden is trying to challenge Moscow on its premise, saying the U.S. and NATO are willing to negotiate if Russia de-escalates tensions. But whether Russia is really willing to engage and walk back from the cliff of conflict - or whether Putin already intends to finish a job he started in 2014 with his seizure of Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula and his start of a war in eastern Ukraine - is an open question, especially after Russia deployed troops to quell protests in Kazakhstan. ""We believe there are areas where we can make progress if Moscow is realistic in its approach. We can't be sure until the talks take place -- that's the nature of diplomacy,"" said a senior State Department official. On Saturday, a senior Biden administration official told reporters that the U.S. and Russia may be able to find agreement on the topics of missile deployments in Europe and the size of troop exercises on either side of Russia's borders with NATO members. Specifically, the official said, Putin does not want offensive missile systems placed in Ukraine, and Biden has already made clear to Putin that ""the United States has no intention of doing that."" The U.S. was also open to discussing the future of certain missile systems in Europe, in the context of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty, from which the Trump administration withdrew and which the U.S. accuses Russia of violating, according to the official. And as troop deployments have ratcheted up tensions in eastern Europe, the official said the U.S. would consider restrictions on troops exercises near the borders Russia shares with NATO members. ""We are willing to explore the possibility of reciprocal restrictions on the size and scope of such exercises,"" the official said, ""including both strategic bombers close to each other's territory and ground-based exercises, as well."" The U.S. would consult its allies and partners before making any commitments related to their security interests, the official said, adding that any commitments would have to be reciprocal -- meaning the U.S. and Russia would ""need to make essentially the same commitment."" The official said bilateral negotiations would primarily take place Monday would there would ""likely"" be an ""initial conversation"" on Sunday night. If Russia and the U.S. are not able to make progress, and if Russia moves ahead with an attack on the former Soviet state, Biden has threatened high-impact sanctions from the U.S. and its allies, including the G7, the European Union, and NATO, as well as NATO deployments to its eastern members and additional arms to Ukraine. But the president has made clear the U.S. will not send troops to defend Ukraine, leaving the ball ultimately in Putin's court. The New York Times on Saturday reported that, if Russia further invades Ukraine, the U.S. and its allies were considering ""cutting off Russia’s largest financial institutions from global transactions, imposing an embargo on American-made or American-designed technology needed for defense-related and consumer industries, and arming insurgents in Ukraine who would conduct what would amount to a guerrilla war against a Russian military occupation, if it comes to that.” The White House's National Security Council declined to comment on the report. After Monday's one-on-one meetings, NATO will hold a meeting with Russia Wednesday -- its first in two and a half years amid icy tensions -- and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, a critical Cold War-era forum that has deployed a war monitor in eastern Ukraine, will convene Thursday. Those other two rounds of talks are equally important in defusing tensions, according to Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who has consistently reiterated the administration's line that they will decide ""nothing about Europe without Europe"" -- adopted from an old Polish saying. ""What's happening in Ukraine is not only about Ukraine. It's part of a broader pattern of destabilizing, dangerous, and often illegal behavior by Moscow,"" Blinken said in a firm speech Friday, rejecting Russia's version of recent history. ""If Russia has legitimate concerns about our actions, the United States, our NATO allies, our OSCE partners are willing to hear them and to try to address them -- if the Kremlin is prepared to reciprocate regarding its own dangerous and destabilizing behavior."" Even after two calls between Biden and Putin in December, U.S. officials are still uncertain if Putin is bluffing and seeking concessions from the U.S. and NATO. But they have said repeatedly they will not compromise on key issues, including Ukraine's security and its potential membership in the alliance. That deep gulf makes it unlikely that Monday's meetings will yield any immediate results -- beyond more talks -- especially because the U.S. has said it will only negotiate on issues between it and Russia, not the threats around Ukraine. ""Hopefully it will result in identifying a few bilateral issues where there is enough common ground to continue discussions and ultimately address together,"" said a second senior State Department official. ""Our hope is that we can follow up this meeting relatively quickly."" When the Russian delegation raises what it has cast as the threat from Ukraine, as it has done publicly now for weeks, the U.S. will listen, the official added, ""because we are wanting to have a dialogue with them."" But ""we are not going to talk above the heads of our European allies and partners,"" they added. Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman will lead the U.S. delegation in Geneva, Switzerland, accompanied by Pentagon and White House National Security Council officials and the top U.S. diplomat for arms control, Bonnie Jenkins. Arms control is one area where U.S. officials have expressed some optimism that they could find common ground with Russia, especially after two previous rounds of talks between Sherman and Jenkins and their counterparts. The day-long talks Monday will be followed by a meeting Wednesday between Russia and NATO -- the first since July 2019. Sherman will lead the U.S. delegation there -- a sign the meeting is equally important to the Biden administration as Monday's one-on-one sessions, according to the first senior State Department official. But even as the administration has repeated its ""nothing about Europe without Europe"" mantra, some European officials have expressed concern about the U.S. and Russia meeting without them. ""There are not two actors alone. It is not just the U.S. and Russia. If we want to talk about security in Europe, Europeans have to be part of the table,"" said Josep Borrell, the E.U.'s top diplomat, during a visit to Ukraine Wednesday. Concerns were particularly heightened Friday after an NBC News report said the U.S. is weighing removing some troops from eastern Europe in exchange for Russia pulling its troops back; what critics cast as appeasement to Putin's threats. But the Biden administration called the report ""erroneous,"" with a third senior State Department official saying they are not weighing troop cuts to Europe, will not discuss U.S. troops in Poland and the Baltics with Russia, and are not compiling a list of potential troop cuts for the talks. State Department officials went even further -- warning U.S. allies that after Monday's talks conclude, Russia is likely to lie about what took place in the meetings. ""We fully expect that the Russian side will make public comments following the meeting on Monday that will not reflect the true nature of the discussions that took place. We would urge our allies and partners to view those comments with extreme skepticism and to continue their ongoing discussions and coordination with the United States,"" the first senior State Department official said. With tension and distrust so high, and expectations low, the administration is being warned not to concede any ground to Putin's negotiators after Moscow has escalated the situation to a crisis point. ""The war talk in Moscow may be a sort of psychological operation to soften up the West, frighten West Europeans, and divide Putin's western adversaries so that a lesser Russian attack -- seizing another slice of Ukraine rather than a full-scale invasion, or stationing Russian forces along the Polish frontier, or 'mere' cyber attacks and physical sabotage in Kyiv -- is greeted with relief and thus accepted,"" wrote Daniel Fried, a retired U.S. ambassador who served as the top U.S. diplomat for Europe, ambassador to Poland, and top sanctions official. Threading that needle between addressing ""whatever is legitimate in Moscow's long litany of grievance"" and pushing ""back against Putin's aggression and pretentions to resume Russia's domination of Europe's eastern half"" will not be easy, Fried added. But it is a critical moment in the future of the international system the U.S. midwifed in the 20th century, with the lives of many on the line, especially Ukrainians. ""The people of Ukraine has been fighting this war for seven years now, and we know how to fight and we know how to win,"" Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba told ABC News last year. ""This is our land, our soil, and we will be defending it. But it's much easier to defend it when you have friends and allies in the back."" ABC News' Ben Gittleson contributed reporting.",29,,,,19

These latest messages from Moscow are the kind that have had U.S. and other western officials on edge that Putin will launch an assault on Ukraine, even after President Joe Biden warned him doing so would bring massive penalties. The Biden administration has repeatedly called for diplomacy with Russia to de-escalate tensions and end the war in Ukraine's eastern provinces, nearly eight years after Russian troops armed separatist forces in a conflict that continues to simmer and claim lives. But Russia's demands for security guarantees, including that Ukraine be barred from joining NATO, have been called ""unacceptable"" by U.S. officials -- possibly purposefully so, so that Russia can later claim to have given diplomacy a shot. Russia has said it has no plans to invade but demanded the U.S., NATO, and Ukraine take seriously its concerns. ""We didn't make the proposals just to see them blocked in terms of the diplomatic process, but for the purpose of reaching a negotiated diplomatic result that would be fixed in legally binding documents. We will aim at this,"" Putin said Sunday. His Deputy Defense Minister Alexander Fomin blamed NATO again Monday for provoking conflict by sending warships and reconnaissance planes to back Ukraine. That echoes a statement last week by his boss, Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu, who claimed Ukraine, with U.S. mercenary help, is preparing a chemical weapons attack. ""The alliance has recently switched to the practice of direct provocations accompanied by the high risk of turning into armed confrontation,"" Fomin said during a meeting that included envoys from 14 NATO countries. It's the kind of false pretext for an invasion that U.S. officials and analysts have warned Russia may create to justify an invasion. ""Russia is ostensibly outraged by a crisis of their own making,"" said Mick Mulroy, a senior Trump administration Pentagon official and ABC News national security analyst. ""It was Russia that put around 175,000 troops on the border and threatened to invade again if its demands were not met -- 'Do what I ask, or I will attack and occupy a sovereign country against all international norms.'"" The estimated number of Russian troops near Ukraine have ranged from 60,000 to over 100,000, with one leaked U.S. intelligence document warning Russia could be prepared to swiftly deploy as many as 175,000. U.S. officials have cited those troop movements, along with Russian propaganda attacks on Ukraine, which they say have increased tenfold, and bellicose rhetoric as evidence of a possible invasion. But diplomacy could stave off war. The U.S. and Russia have agreed to hold talks in January to address each side's concerns, along with talks between NATO and Russia and meetings at the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, according to U.S. officials. The OSCE, a key security forum, has deployed a war monitor in eastern Ukraine for years as the conflict has taken some 14,000 lives. After coordinating a meeting between the Ukrainian government and the Russian-controlled separatists last week, the OSCE declared Thursday that both sides showed a ""strong determination to fully adhere"" to a July 2020 ceasefire agreement. The statement was heralded by Biden's National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan and the State Department, whose spokesperson said, ""We hope the resultant peace will create the diplomatic space necessary to de-escalate regional tensions and provide a positive atmosphere for further discussion."" There has been no ""resultant peace."" Three Ukrainian soldiers were wounded in shelling that last for hours on Sunday. There had been five times more ceasefire violations this month than last December, according to the OSCE. But there was some notable Russian troop movements, according to state-run Interfax news agency, which reported that more than 10,000 troops pulled back from near Ukraine's borders after military drills. The Kremlin also said Monday that it made sense to engage NATO directly about its security concerns, in addition to the U.S. Whether that is yet a sign for hope that war can be avoided is unclear. U.S. officials have said it's still unknown whether Putin has decided to invade, with tens of thousands of troops still in the area, including in Crimea, the Ukrainian peninsula Russia invaded and seized in 2014.",29,,,,21
2021-12-23,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/International/tensions-rise-russia-ukraine-putin-places-blame-west/story?id=81913009,"Amid Ukraine invasion fears, Putin says West must give NATO guarantees","MOSCOW -- Amid fears Russia might invade Ukraine, Russia’s president Vladimir Putin has again repeated demands for guarantees from Western countries that NATO will not expand in eastern Europe, but also expressed hope that negotiations with the Biden administration in January could allow the two sides to “move forward."" Putin offered the mixed messages on Thursday during his marathon end-of-year press conference in Moscow, making menacing accusations against Ukraine but also sounding more hopeful notes around the possibility for negotiation. Western countries are alarmed that Russia may be preparing a renewed invasion into Ukraine this winter, amid a build up of tens of thousands of Russian troops on its border. Putin has demanded the U.S. and NATO give legal guarantees the alliance will not expand further and withdraw NATO troop deployments from eastern Europe. The Biden administration has called those demands non-starters but has agreed to hold talks with Russia over its concerns. Putin on Thursday said those talks would take place in Geneva in January and said Russia had seen a “positive reaction” from the U.S. to its demands to negotiate. “I hope that the first positive reaction and the announced possible start of work in the near future, in the first days of January, will allow us to move forward,” Putin said. Putin said Russia was forced to confront NATO and Ukraine now to prevent the country potentially becoming a base for NATO missiles in the future. “And so we put the question directly: there must be no movement of NATO further to the east,” he said. “The ball is in their court. They must answer us something."" The U.S. and NATO countries have rejected Russia’s demands for a veto on NATO expansion, seeing them as an attempt by the Kremlin to have formal recognition for a sphere of influence over Ukraine. Analysts and Western officials have been trying to understand whether the Russian build up is a negotiating tactic or signals a real readiness to invade. Putin’s comments on Thursday did little to move the needle. He said Russia did not want conflict but alleged there Ukraine might be preparing a military operation to re-take the Russian-controlled separatist regions in its east, saying Kyiv had tried to do it twice before in the past. “They keep telling us: war, war, war,” Putin said. “There is an impression that, maybe, they are preparing for the third military operation and are warning us in advance: do not intervene, do not protect these people. But if you do intervene and protect them, there will be new sanctions. Perhaps, we should prepare for that."" Analysts fear Russia might use the accusation of a Ukrainian attack as pretext to launch its own invasion. There are no signs Ukraine’s government is preparing such an assault, which would risk an overwhelming Russian response. Russia last week published two draft treaties listing its demands from the U.S. and NATO. The proposals would limit NATO troops and military infrastructure to the countries where they were based before 1997, when the key eastern European members joined. The Biden administration immediately rejected Russia’s demands limiting which countries can join NATO. But it has said it is ready to hold talks with Moscow about some of the other proposals, which are linked to arms control for example. Putin spoke at length and angrily about NATO’s expansion eastward since the end of the Cold War, a grievance he has long held. Asked by a journalist from Britain’s Sky News on Thursday if he would guarantee Russia will not invade Ukraine, Putin said it was Russia that needed guarantees from Western countries over NATO. “What guarantees must we give you? You must give us guarantees. Right here and right now!” Putin said. ABC News' Tanya Stukalova contributed to this report.",29,,,,21
2021-12-17,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/International/russia-makes-sweeping-demands-security-guarantees-us-amid/story?id=81821816,Russia makes sweeping demands for security guarantees from US amid Ukraine tensions,"Russia published a list of sweeping new security guarantees it wants from the United States and NATO on Friday -- including a promise not to expand the alliance -- staking out demands for de-escalating the crisis it has stoked around Ukraine. The radical proposals would rewrite the post-Cold War security order in Europe, obliging the U.S. and NATO to commit to not admitting any new members, including Ukraine, but also effectively prohibiting any NATO military activity in Eastern Europe and most of the former Soviet Union. The demands were presented in two draft treaties that Russia's foreign ministry published on Friday, with Russia saying it had passed them to the Biden administration earlier this week. But the U.S. and NATO countries have already previously ruled out Russian demands for a veto on the alliance's expansion and on Friday a senior Biden administration official immediately rejected the two key Russian proposals to bar Ukraine from ever joining or NATO expanding farther eastward. ""We will not compromise on key principles on which European security is built,"" the administration official told reporters, speaking on the condition of anonymity. ""All countries have the right to decide their own future and their own foreign policy, free from outside interference, and that goes for Ukraine and it also goes for NATO allies and the alliance itself,"" the senior administration official said, adding President Joe Biden made that clear to Russian President Vladimir Putin during their call last week. Russia made the proposals against the backdrop of its military buildup near Ukraine, where the U.S. says Russia has massed over 100,000 troops, with the implicit threat it could use force if its demands are not met. Western countries fear Putin may be preparing a new major military incursion against Ukraine and have been trying to understand whether the Russian leader is really prepared to escalate the conflict this winter. Friday's proposals addressed a grievance the Kremlin has nurtured for nearly three decades about NATO's expansion since the Cold War -- into what Moscow views as its sphere of influence. The Russian draft treaties call for NATO to remove any troops or weapons from countries that joined the alliance after 1997, meaning most of Eastern Europe, including Poland, the Baltic states and Balkan countries. It also calls for the U.S. and Russia to refrain from deploying troops in areas where they could be perceived as a threat to each countries' national security, and a ban on sending their aircraft and warships into areas where they could strike each other's territory. The treaty would also ban the deployment of intermediate-range missiles in Europe. The limits on NATO in Eastern Europe are seen as a non-starter by most experts. Most analysts in Moscow believe the Kremlin itself is aware that the proposals are unrealistic. Some said that rather than real goals, they may represent an opening gambit aimed at winning some concessions. ""This is a bargaining position -- [the Kremlin] is trying to get some degree of partial acceptance,"" Andrey Kortunov, head of the Russian International Affairs Council, told The Moscow Times. The senior Biden administration official said that while it rejected out of hand the proposed limits on NATO membership for Ukraine and others, it was reviewing the other Russian proposals, hinting it was possible there might be some areas for discussion. The official noted that several of the issues raised by Russia -- arms control for example -- were already being dealt with in different talks between the U.S. and Russia. The official said the U.S. would respond with a ""more concrete"" proposal to the Russians next week after consulting with allies, but added it will include a list of their own concerns ""about Russia's posture and behavior."" But other analysts found the unrealistic nature of Russia's demands disturbing, interpreting them as perhaps a sign the Kremlin is laying the groundwork now to justify an invasion that it will paint as the result of failed negotiations. ""I don't see this as something aimed at a productive negotiation, even if some parts of this could have been discussed and considered privately,"" Vladimir Frolov, a former Russian diplomat and current foreign affairs commentator, told ABC News. Dmitry Trenin, the director of the Carnegie Moscow Center, wrote on Twitter that Russia publishing the demands now ""may suggest that Moscow (rightly) considers their acceptance by west unlikely."" That means Russia is more likely to use military force to ensure they are realized, he said. Russia's buildup has not stopped since Biden and Putin's call last week, with satellite imagery showing vehicles and equipment continuing to appear at new sites near Ukraine. Most experts believe the Russian troops will not withdraw while the Kremlin continues its diplomatic push for concessions.",29,,,,19
2021-12-12,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/International/front-line-eastern-ukraine-biden-putin-talk/story?id=81677077,"On the front line of eastern Ukraine, as Biden and Putin talk","AVDIIVKA, Ukraine -- As President Joe Biden called Russian President Vladimir Putin this week, warning him against launching a renewed invasion of Ukraine, Ukrainian soldiers were going through an ordinary day on the front in eastern Ukraine. Hunkered down in their positions in shell-shattered factories and muddy trenches, they kept watch while every hour or so the sound of small-arms fire popped from the lines of Russian-backed separatists a few dozen yards away. The main purpose of the call for Biden was to try to deter Putin from launching a new incursion, amid fears over the buildup of tens of thousands of Russian troops on Ukraine's eastern border. But in positions on the edge of Avdiivka, an industrial town in Ukraine's Donbas region where Ukrainian troops have been dug in opposite the Russian-backed separatist lines for seven years, the call seemed to attract only mild attention. Although they acknowledged uncertainty about it, there was little sense the Ukrainian soldiers were bracing for an imminent invasion. Instead, the troops there were focused on the daily dangers of the conflict that has not died despite a 2015 peace agreement, remaining for years -- a slow, bleeding wound on Ukraine's eastern edge. Several soldiers told ABC News reporters this week that they don't see a renewed massive Russian offensive as likely for now, though they said they needed to be ready all the same. Oleksiy Kasyanov, a 22-year-old lieutenant from the 25th Airborne Brigade, said he was aware of the Russian build-up but said he thinks it's mostly posturing. ""I think it's a show,"" he said, standing in a trench where his unit is deployed for the next six months. More senior Ukrainian military officials have expressed greater concerns. The head of Ukraine's military intelligence service has warned Russia may be preparing to invade in late January. U.S. intelligence has expressed similar concerns, briefing U.S. newspapers last week that the Kremlin may be planning a multi-front offensive then involving up to 175,000 troops. U.S. officials have said they do not think Putin has yet decided to use force or if the build-up is just a ploy to intimidate. But they fear the possibility of invasion is now higher than any time since 2015. The conflict in eastern Ukraine began shortly after Russia annexed Crimea in 2014 and then armed and directed separatist paramilitaries who seized control in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. Russian regular units later intervened on a large scale as the paramilitaries suffered setbacks. A peace agreement in 2015 ended large-scale fighting but never resolved the conflict. Instead, it settled into the smoldering stand-off, where the Ukrainians and Russian-backed forces eye each other from trenches and exchange sporadic fire along the line most days. The war has displaced over two million people and killed over 10,000 since 2014. Fifty-five Ukrainian soldiers have died this year already, with many more injured, according to Ukraine's defense ministry. Separatist authorities announced an end to a ceasefire earlier this year, and casualties have since ticked up, according to a UN human rights monitoring mission to the region. It found between February and July, 15 civilians were killed and 47 injured, a 50% increase from last year. Western countries worry that Russia is now ready to break up the current deadlock with a major incursion if it fails to get concessions from the U.S. and Ukraine over NATO support for the country and to implement more of the 2015 peace agreement. Putin has denied Russia is preparing any type of invasion, accusing Western countries and Ukraine of provoking tensions. On the ground, Ukrainian officers said the situation along the front felt as usual for now. Brigadier General Anatoly Shevchenko, deputy commander for Ukraine's Joint Forces, said that military activity along the frontline had increased slightly but ""not a lot."" He said, for now, Ukraine had not detected a substantial increase of regular Russian troops within the separatist territories, saying the buildup was mostly taking place in Russia. ""We are ready for anything,"" Shevchenko said. The industrial zone on the edge of Avdiivka, only a few miles from the separatists' de-facto capital Donetsk, saw some of the heaviest fighting in 2014 and continues to be one of the most active points on the front. Inside a devastated factory, shredded by tank and artillery shells, Ukrainian troops have erected fortifications of sandbags and other wreckage. A network of CCTV cameras pointed at no man's land watch for movement. Ukrainian officers said most of the fighters on the other side were local, but that Russian military advisors and snipers were working among them. They said Ukrainian troops were allowed only to fire if fired on, out of concern that Russia might use any incident as a pretext for launching a broader attack. Biden and Putin's call on Tuesday offered little clue whether the crisis would now calm. Colonel Yaroslav Melnychuk, a spokesperson for Ukraine's military, expressed hope Biden's call with Putin might ease the situation. He said he longed for peace but had little hope it would come soon. ""Everyone dreams of that,"" he said. ""But the reality is that we have been doing this for eight years. We have to be ready for anything.""",14,,,,10

In the most urgent warning yet, Blinken said the U.S. and its NATO allies would impose a steep cost on Moscow if it attacked its neighbor. But that cost would be economic and political, with the top U.S. diplomat threatening ""a range of high-impact economic measures that we've refrained from using in the past."" But he and NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg stopped short of mentioning the use of force to defend Ukraine, which is not a member of the military alliance. ""We don't know whether President Putin has made the decision to invade. We do know he's putting in place the capacity to do so in short order,"" Blinken said -- the clearest statement to date of Western worries of an invasion, as Russia masses approximately 100,000 troops, along with heavy equipment, near Ukraine's border. Blinken will meet his Russian counterpart, Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, on the sidelines of a summit on European security Thursday, as well as Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba. It will be the latest high-level engagement between the U.S. and Russia amid heightened concern about Russia threatening Ukraine. President Joe Biden deployed his CIA Director Bill Burns to Moscow last month to convey U.S. concerns in person, Blinken said, declining to specify whether he would lay out precisely what those ""high-impact"" sanctions would be with Lavrov. Russia has denied it is mounting any attack on Ukraine and instead accused Ukraine, the U.S. and NATO of menacing forces near its borders. Russian President Vladimir Putin said Wednesday his government is seeking guarantees from the West that it not move troops or weapons systems ""in close vicinity to the Russian territory,"" while Lavrov called the presence of Ukrainian troops ""alarming."" Blinken literally laughed off that latter comment, telling reporters after a two-day NATO summit in Latvia that it was ""perplexing,"" ""profoundly wrong"" and ""misguided."" ""The idea that Ukraine represents a threat to Russia would be a bad joke if things weren't so serious,"" he added, warning that Russia may ""claim provocation for something that they were planning to do all along."" To that end, Blinken said, Russia has not only massed combat forces, it's also ""intensified disinformation to paint Ukraine as the aggressor"" -- increasing anti-Ukrainian propaganda by more than tenfold to levels not seen since its 2014 invasion. Russia's ""plans include efforts to destabilize Ukraine from within, as well as large-scale military operations,"" he added -- the former, a possible reference to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy's claim that Russia is behind a potential coup attempt to overthrow his government. The top U.S. diplomat for Europe said last Friday that the U.S. was in touch with Ukrainian authorities ""to obtain additional information"" and verify Zelenskiy's statement.",29,,,,19
2021-11-26,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/International/russias-buildup-troops-ukraine-sparks-fears-attack-analysis/story?id=81370345,Russia's buildup of troops near Ukraine sparks fears of attack: Analysis,"Is Russia preparing to invade Ukraine? Fears of invasion are greater now than at any time since Moscow first seized Crimea in 2014. For the past month, the United States has been sounding the alarm that Russia has amassed more than 100,000 troops near eastern Ukraine and may be preparing to launch a major military incursion. Satellite imagery and videos posted to social media appear to show Russian armored units and artillery moving to the area. Ukraine’s military has also warned Russian forces could attack in late January or early February. The short answer of course is no one knows if Russian President Vladimir Putin is really planning an attack. Russian experts are fiercely divided over the Kremlin’s intentions: Is the country bluffing or flexing its muscles to intimidate Ukraine and the U.S. into concessions? Or is it preparing a real invasion? There have been war scares throughout seven-year conflict and this too could prove illusory. But the fears this time are different. Many analysts, including many who are normally skeptical of such scares, believe Putin’s calculus on Ukraine has shifted and the risk he will now use force is high. Those analysts believe the buildup is not just saber-rattling; it gives Russia an option to launch a real military intervention if Putin fails to get what he wants through threats. “Although Russian President Vladimir Putin may once again be engaging in coercive diplomacy, this time around Moscow may not be bluffing. If no agreement is reached, the conflict may renew on a much larger scale,” Michael Kofman and Michael Kimmage wrote in Foreign Affairs this week. “The scenario of a wider war is entirely plausible.” An invasion this time would be more dangerous than Russia’s seizure of Crimea, likely triggering the worst crisis between Moscow and the West in 40 years and carrying a risk of a wider conflict in Europe. The world went through this already at the start of the year when Russia began the troop buildup. It turned out Putin was bluffing. Many experts believe it helped win him a summit with President Joe Biden. Russia, however, has denied it is preparing to attack but has accused Ukraine of acting provocatively. Most analysts caution the current buildup may again be linked to another potential summit between Putin and Biden, one the Kremlin is pressing to hold by the end of this year. The Kremlin is good at creating the illusion of a potential attack and experts warn against falling into the trap of believing it. But the fears this time are different. The U.S. and independent analysts are expressing greater anxiety now than last April. Russia’s rhetoric is more aggressive this time around, according to analysts. Most experts believe Putin has not yet decided whether to use force. But at the root of the worries is that the Kremlin’s view of the conflict has crucially changed. Why would Russia invade now? This is the key question. The biggest argument is what would Putin gain. It would make a Russia a pariah, carrying major risks while likely achieving few of its objectives. The reasons for Russia’s current buildup are the same for seizing Crimea—the Kremlin will not accept ""losing"" Ukraine and having it join NATO and the European Union. The problem for the Kremlin is that Ukraine has been moving ever more firmly toward the West in recent years. Full membership in NATO is not on the cards but Ukraine has become closer with the alliance. The U.S. already supplies Ukraine with lethal weapons and Ukrainian troops train with NATO forces. As Andrew Weiss and Eugene Rumer from the Carnegie Center recently wrote, “The Kremlin increasingly views Ukraine as a Western aircraft carrier parked just across” from southern Russia. At the same time, Russia has come to see its diplomatic tools for keeping Ukraine close as non-functioning. In 2015, as Russian forces were inflicting heavily casualties, Moscow was able to force Ukraine to sign the so-called Minsk peace agreements. The deal obliged Kyiv to grant wide autonomy to the pro-Russian breakaway regions in its East. In practice, that would give Russia a lever inside Ukraine’s government, giving an effective veto over its efforts to join NATO or the EU. Ukraine has never wanted to accept that and the agreements have been effectively dead for years. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, meanwhile has turned to a hard-line approach to Russia. The fear is that amid all this, Putin now feels Ukraine is drifting too far, too fast from Russia and that force is the only way to get Western countries and Kyiv to take Moscow’s demands seriously. “Russian leaders have signaled that they have grown tired of diplomacy and find Ukraine’s growing integration with the United States and NATO intolerable,” wrote Kofman, an expert on Russian military policy, and Kimmage, a former State Department official on Russia/Ukraine policy. “The stage is set for Moscow to reset this equation through force—unless Moscow, Washington, and Kyiv are able to find a peaceful resolution.” The Kremlin has signaled what it wants. Last week, Putin said Russia should seek “serious, long-term” security guarantees from the U.S. over Ukraine. In practice, that likely means a guarantee of no further NATO expansion and the curtailing of Western military assistance to Kyiv. The fear among some analysts is whether Putin will use force if he doesn’t get those guarantees. Experts in Moscow with close ties to the Russian foreign policy establishment have echoed those worries. Fyodor Lukyanov, chairman of the Council of Foreign and Defense Policy, warned in an article this week that what's happening can become a “serious milestone in European history after the end of the Cold War.” “The unfolding situation is dangerous because of the loss of a common understanding of what is happening,” he wrote. A dangerous ingredient in all of this is Putin’s vision of Ukraine. Putin has repeatedly said he considers Ukrainians and Russians “one people” and the issue appears to have personal importance to him. In July, Putin published a 5,000-word article on Ukraine’s history where he questioned its right to exist as an independent state. As the historian Sergey Plokhy has written, Ukraine’s departure from its sphere of influence will mean the end of the Kremlin’s vision of Russia as an imperial power that Putin has sought to restore. Ukraine is “unfinished business” for Putin, Rumer and Weiss wrote. What might happen? The scenario most experts fear is Russia will use a false pretext of a supposed Ukrainian attack on the pro-Russian rebel territories to launch an invasion. Few believe Russia would try to seize Kyiv or occupy the whole country. What is seen as plausible is that Russia would try to inflict a devastating blow on Ukraine’s military and perhaps seize some territory, including major cities. The idea would be a blow so painful that it would force Kyiv and NATO to scale back their cooperation. This is what Russia did in 2008, when it invaded Georgia. Top Russian officials this week have been comparing the current situation to the run-up to the Georgia war, accusing Ukraine of preparing an attack. Some experts fear those comments are meant to lay the ground for a repeat of the Georgia invasion. Will it happen? Many experts argue it is still unlikely Putin will attack. Even those warning of the possibility say Putin may realize the costs outweigh the potential benefits. But these experts are concerned how plausible an attack has become. What is frightening is the gulf that is opening up between what the West views as Russia’s rational interests around Ukraine and what Russia thinks they are. “From the point of view of the balance of benefits and losses, neither side is interested in a real war,” Ivan Timofeyev, an analyst close to Russia’s foreign ministry, wrote in an article this week. He added, ""Therefore, it is hardly worth considering the war scenario as a likely one. However, history knows many examples when rational calculations have failed to put an end to escalation. There is only the hope that this isn’t the case here.""",29,,,,10

""Cybercom's mission is to play the away game and to execute operations outside of the United States that keep us secure,"" Maj. Gen. Joe Hartman, commander of the Cyber National Mission Force, told ABC News' Chief Justice Correspondent Pierre Thomas. ""On a daily basis, whether it's nation-state, malicious cyber actors trying to steal secrets, whether it's ransomware actors -- every day our adversary gets up and attempts to execute operations against the United States. They're not going to stop and neither are we."" Hartman oversees Cyber Command’s Cyber National Mission Force, comprised of more than 2,000 military and civilian personnel -- focused on securing and protection U.S. national interests from foreign-threat actors. The NSA has an entire center dedicated to collaborating with partners. ""So NSA has been in cybersecurity for a really long time,"" said Morgan Adamski, the chief of the NSA's Cybersecurity Collaboration Center. ""And we've shared our deep insights into foreign cyber-actor activity as well as our technical expertise, but the way that the actors are working now, they're working so quickly. We had to kind of adapt to the way that we were sharing that information."" She said the NSA engages with partners at a ""rapid"" speed to share information. Acting in the cyber world ""is part of our daily life,"" Hartman said. ""What we see with adversaries is they will execute broad-scale operations,"" he added, referencing Russia's role in last year's SolarWinds hack. The intrusion, believed to be carried out by Russia, involved software from SolarWinds, which makes IT management tools, that had been adulterated or ""trojanized"" with a vulnerability that could be exploited by hackers to steal information, manipulate systems or plant trap doors and other exploits for future use. It gained access to nine government agencies. ""They executed operations against thousands of targets, ultimately to provide them access and to use that access for future operations,"" he said in reference to the attack. Cyberspace is ""extraordinarily dynamic,"" Hartman said. ""Cyberspace is the one domain that changes on a daily basis,"" he said. ""And our adversaries pay attention to that. We need to pay attention to it. And as I think you're aware, when a vulnerability is identified, the quicker we are able to mitigate that vulnerability, the safer you are at home on your personal computer and the safer we are as a nation. But again, it is dynamic and it changes daily."" Rob Joyce, who serves as the Director of Cybersecurity at NSA, told ABC News that the NSA was not always a collaborative environment. ""NSA throughout history works in the secret area. We work with secrets. That doesn't make us open and collaborative. But what we've found is, the things we know are not useful unless we do something with it. Collaboration is the act of taking the secrets we know and getting those out to operationalize them."" He said the NSA has some of the best cyber experts in the world and employs some of the best cyber people In the country. ""It's all about the mission. It's about the outcomes, and that drives us to work together,"" he said. Joyce said even he could be susceptible to a phishing email and that systems need to be brought up to speed.

2021-11-19,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/whats-stake-security-nation-nsa-chief-defending-us/story?id=81258606,"'What's at stake is obviously the security of our nation,' NSA chief says of defending US from cyberattacks","Every day, foreign adversaries make millions of attempts to scan America's military networks, Director of the National Security Agency and Commander of U.S. Cyber Command Gen. Paul Nakasone says, and there is incredible pressure to defend the nation from those adversaries. ""What's at stake is obviously the security of our nation,"" Nakasone told ABC News Chief Justice Correspondent Pierre Thomas in an exclusive interview. ""We don't want to have a failure to imagine what's happening."" ABC News was granted exclusive behind-the-scenes access to the ""Battle Bridge"" where the secret spy agency's cyber operations take place. Everyone from sailors to civilians works on the main floor of the Integrated Cyber Command Center at Fort Meade in Maryland outside Washington. ""This is military, civilian, contractor. This is Department of Defense. This is intelligence community. This is other agencies of our government. They're all resident here working side by side,"" Nakasone said, adding that they have ""unlimited reach."" The surge of ransomware is a national security issue, Nakasone said, adding that if you asked him a year ago what he thought about the response, he'd say it was a criminal matter. ""Think of your day, think of my day,"" he said. ""What do we do with regards to our information? How do we communicate? How do we buy things? How do we store our money? This is all done online. This is what our nation has been able to leverage for so many years. This is an important medium. And we have to make sure that that medium is safe and secure."" To do so, the U.S. Cyber Command uses ""Hunt Forward"" teams. ""Our 'Hunt Forward' teams are defensive teams that are requested by a partner, an ally, a country to come and hunt on their networks. Why do we do that? Because we do that to be able to identify malware and tradecraft of our adversaries,"" he said. ""Once we do that, we share that with the private sector and that provides a level of inoculation or protection from that type of malware. So, we've done 24 missions over the past several years."" Nakasone said he first heard about the Colonial Pipeline ransomware attack in the news media. In May, hackers, who the government later said were based in Russia, caused Colonial Pipeline's fuel lines to shut down and created a major disruption in the nation's fuel supply and a run on gas stations along the East Coast. ""I heard about it from family members that said, 'Hey, aren't you the commander of U.S. Cyber Command and the director of NSA? Can't you do something about this?' That's the moment in time when I knew that this is serious, this is touching the American people,"" he said. In addition to Colonial Pipeline, meat supplier JBS was hacked by a different Russia-based group, REvil, authorities said, prompting the Justice Department to put out a $10 million reward for information leading to its founder. That reward shows the ""national power"" being applied against ransomware attacks, Nakasone said. Stopping and protecting against cyberattacks takes private and public partnerships, he said, and 90% of the nation's critical infrastructure is in the private sector. Nakasone said six months ago he would have given American businesses a ""low C"" for investing in infrastructure to protect their networks and educating the workforce. ""I think that we've gotten a lot better since then, but we still have a ways to go,"" he said. Nakasone also assured Americans that the agency is not spying on Americans, as some have alleged. ""What I would say that makes me so confident is every single person that works at our agency whether they're military, civilian, the first thing you do, you swear an oath to defend the Constitution,"" he said. ""The second thing is we have robust training here. And the third thing is we have a culture of being able to look and ensure what we're doing is by the book and by the law."" Asked about intelligence failures in Afghanistan, Nakasone said things always look different in hindsight. ""I think with any mission we always take a look back and say, 'What could we have done better?' We've had 20 years of experience in being able to deploy our people to Afghanistan, think about it,"" he said. ""What really was the difference is not the fact that we sent great technology or the fact that we had superb tradecraft, it was our talent that went to Afghanistan. But we'll take a look back and we'll say what could we have done better certainly."" He said the NSA takes security seriously, especially after well-known security breaches like the case of Edward Snowden. ""We take security incredibly seriously here. There's a vigilance that's applied to it. Understanding exactly what takes place here is something that we have learned our lessons on, and we'll continue to make sure that we have a safe and secure workplace to make sure that we can operate from."" Nakasone said a top priority is recruiting and maintaining the best talent, adding he prides himself on the diversity of U.S. Cyber Command and NSA's workforce. ""One of the things that makes this place go, that makes our agency and command go, the best people. And so how do we recruit? How do we retain? How do we ensure the population can rejoin our agency once they go to the private sector? That's what keeps me up at night,"" he said. ABC News' Jack Date contributed to this report.",3,,,,4
2021-11-16,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/us-condemns-dangerous-russian-anti-satellite-test/story?id=81181090,US condemns Russian anti-satellite test it says created 'dangerous' debris field,"The United States on Monday condemned a Russian anti-satellite test against one of its own satellites that the U.S. said created a field of more than 1,500 pieces of debris that could remain in orbit for decades and pose a threat to other satellites. Previous Russian tests have been of missiles or ""killer satellites"" capable of bringing down a satellite, but the new test marks the first time Russia has brought down a satellite with a missile. The State Department criticized the Russian test as another example of what it said was Russia's ""dangerous and irresponsible behavior"" in its space military operations. ""Earlier today the Russian Federation recklessly conducted a destructive test of a direct--ascent anti satellite missile against one of its own satellites,"" Ned Price, the State Department spokesman told reporters Monday. ""This test has so far generated over fifteen hundred pieces of trackable orbital debris and hundreds of thousands of pieces of smaller orbital debris that now threatens the interests of all nations,"" said Price. ""Russia's dangerous and irresponsible behavior jeopardizes the long term sustainability of our space and clearly demonstrates that Russia's claims of opposing the weapons and weaponization of space are disingenuous and hypocritical,"" said Price in language not typically seen in diplomatic statements. Pentagon spokesman John Kirby told reporters that the Defense Department shared similar concerns about the new Russian test. ""We watch closely the kinds of capabilities that Russia seems to want to develop which could pose a threat not just to our national security interests, but the security instance of other spacefaring nations,"" said Kirby. The new test marked the first time Russia destroyed an orbiting satellite with a ground-based missile, but previous tests have also sparked strong U.S. criticism. Last year, Russia carried out two similar tests with ground-based missiles that either demonstrated the capability or missed their targets. A third test in July of last year involved a different anti-satellite technology when a ""killer satellite"" deployed a projectile in the direction of another satellite. In 2007, China drew international condemnation after it destroyed an orbiting satellite that created a large debris field. The following year the United States brought down an American satellite for which the remaining fuel supply posed a threat to human populations upon reentry but also showed that the U.S. could target an orbiting satellite. In 2019, India destroyed one of its satellites demonstrating that it, too, was capable of anti-satellite technology. ""Russia has demonstrated a complete disregard for the security, safety, stability, and long-term sustainability of the space domain for all nations,"" Gen. James Dickinson, the commander of U.S. Space Command, said in a statement. ""The debris created by Russia's DA-ASAT will continue to pose a threat to activities in outer space for years to come, putting satellites and space missions at risk, as well as forcing more collision avoidance maneuvers,"" said Dickinson. ""Space activities underpin our way of life and this kind of behavior is simply irresponsible.” Price said the test would ""significantly increase the risk to astronauts and cosmonauts on the International Space Station, as well as to other human spaceflight activities."" That threat seems to have been borne out on Monday when the seven American and Russian crewmembers aboard the space station were ordered for a time to take refuge in their Dragon and Soyuz lifeboats as the space station repeatedly passed through an unspecified debris field. Earlier on Monday, U.S. Space Command confirmed that it was ""aware of a debris-generating event in outer space"" and that it was ""actively working to characterize the debris field and will continue to ensure all space-faring nations have the information necessary to maneuver satellites if impacted.""",3,,,,9
2021-11-05,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/blinken-details-efforts-investigate-havana-syndrome/story?id=80991396,Blinken details new efforts to investigate 'Havana syndrome',"Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Friday detailed new efforts to investigate ""Havana syndrome,"" the mysterious health affliction affecting dozens of U.S. personnel first identified in Cuba and now including several countries. In his most extensive remarks yet on the issue, Blinken said the incidents have inflicted ""profound"" physical and physiological harm on those impacted. ""All of us in the U.S. government, and especially with the State Department, are intently focused on getting to the bottom of what and who is causing these incidents, caring for those who have been affected and protecting our people,"" Blinken said. Symptoms include headaches, dizziness, cognitive difficulties, tinnitus, vertigo and trouble with seeing, hearing or balancing. Many officials have suffered symptoms years after reporting an incident, while some have been diagnosed with traumatic brain injuries. Blinken has tapped two career diplomats to oversee the agency's response to ""Havana syndrome."" For almost five years now, the issue -- which the Biden administration has labeled ""anomalous health incidents"" -- has vexed U.S. officials, who don't know who or what is behind it. In an effort to learn more, Blinken confirmed Friday that the State Department has deployed new technology to U.S. missions around the world to help understand the cause. ""The details I can provide on this are limited as well, but I can say that new technology is helping us more quickly and thoroughly evaluate a variety of potential causes of these incidents, and we've distributed across posts so that we can respond rapidly to new reports,"" he said. He encouraged employees with any knowledge of an incident to come forward. ""There is absolutely no stigma in reporting these incidents. And there will of course be no negative consequences of any kind,"" Blinken said. ""On the contrary, reporting means that we can get people the help they need. And by reporting, you can help keep others safe, and help us get to the bottom of who and what is responsible."" American diplomats, spies, and other officials have reported symptoms in nearly a dozen counties, starting in Cuba and expanding to China, Russia, Uzbekistan, and more. Most recently, cases were reported among staff and families at the U.S. embassy in Colombia, weeks before Blinken arrived for a visit. But it's unclear how many reported incidents are confirmed to be episodes of what many victims insist are attacks. Both the Trump and Biden administrations have been accused by victims and other officials of not doing enough to provide medical care to affected personnel or not sharing enough information about reported incidents as they happen. Blinken acknowledged the administration could do better and committed to more transparency. He met a group of affected personnel in Bogotá last month, telling them ""their case is an absolute priority for him,"" a senior State Department official told ABC News. President Joe Biden signed the HAVANA Act last month, which authorizes the CIA director and the secretary of state to provide affected employees with financial support for brain injuries under detailed criteria. It also requires both agencies to report to Congress on how those payments are being made and whether additional action is needed to aid victims.",3,,,,8
2021-10-25,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/russian-nation-state-actor-solarwinds-cyberattack-microsoft/story?id=80771329,Russian nation-state actor behind SolarWinds cyberattack at it again: Microsoft,"The same actors behind the SolarWinds breach that infiltrated nine U.S. government agencies is attempting to do the same targeting the global supply chain, researchers from Microsoft have concluded. Russian nation-state actor Nobelium is targeting the cloud service and technology providers ""that customize, deploy and manage"" services for customers, Microsoft said. ""We believe Nobelium ultimately hopes to piggyback on any direct access that resellers may have to their customers' IT systems and more easily impersonate an organization’s trusted technology partner to gain access to their downstream customers,"" the report said. The intrusion involves software from SolarWinds, which makes IT management tools, that had been adulterated or ""Trojanized"" with a vulnerability that could be exploited by hackers to steal information, manipulate systems or plant trap doors and other exploits for future use. The hack even compromised former acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf's emails, according to three sources familiar with the situation. Starting in May 2021, the company said it notified 140 resellers and technology service providers it said had been targeted by Nobelium, 14 of which were compromised. Microsoft said these attacks are part of a larger pattern of the group’s activities: between July 1 and October 19, they informed 609 customers that they had been targeted by Nobelium. ""This recent activity is another indicator that Russia is trying to gain long-term, systematic access to a variety of points in the technology supply chain and establish a mechanism for surveilling – now or in the future – targets of interest to the Russian government,"" Microsoft said. The alleged activity also comes as President Joe Biden has put Russia on notice that these types of cyberattacks will not be tolerated. The White House on Monday declined to explicitly confirm the allegation by Microsoft that the same actors behind the SolarWinds breach were now attacking the global supply chain. But when asked about it by ABC News, White House principal deputy press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre did not dispute the Microsoft account. She even repeated some of what the company alleged, but referred questions about the details to the company -- and more broadly said the U.S. was ""aggressively using our authorities to protect the nation from cyberthreats."" ""Broadly speaking,"" she said, ""the federal government is aggressively using our authorities to protect the nation from cyberthreats, including helping the private sector defend itself through increased intelligence sharing, innovative partnership to deploy cybersecurity technologies, bilateral and multilateral diplomacy and measures we do not speak about publicly or national security reasons."" Javed Ali, the former director of counterterrorism at the National Security Council, told ABC News this campaign is a continuation of Russia's aggressive cyber operations ""using state-backed security services."" ""This operation also raises a host of questions about the limits of the Biden administration's approach to Russia, which seems to include a combination of carrots and sticks to prevent, punish, and deter similar attacks,"" Ali said. The Biden administration has taken several steps to in an attempt to mitigate cyberattacks, such as executive orders strengthening cooperation on cybersecurity with the public sector and sanctions against the Russian government officials or the criminal groups responsible for cyberattacks. ""Critics of this approach will say the Russian government continues to operate with impunity in cyberspace and that the United States has not imposed the right level of costs to deter future activity,"" Ali, who also was a senior FBI and DHS official said. ""Whether the Biden administration is willing to escalate to even more aggressive measures remains to be seen given other geopolitical risks and concerns with Russian activity."" Jean-Pierre, the White House spokesperson, seemed to downplay the alleged Russian flouting of Biden's actions. ""According to Microsoft, the activities described were unsophisticated password spray and phishing attempts for the purpose of surveillance that cybersecurity exa-- -- experts say are attempted every day by Russia and other foreign governments and have been for years,"" she said. ""You can prevent these attempts if the cloud service providers implement baseline cybersecurity practices, including multi-factor authentication."" ABC News reached out to the Russian embassy for comment but did not receive an immediate response. ABC News' Ben Gittleson contributed to this report.",3,,,,6

""On October 16, 2021, the Company identified and began to investigate and take steps to contain a potential security incident. On October 17, 2021, the Company identified that certain servers and workstations in its environment were encrypted with ransomware, and that certain office and operational networks were disrupted,"" the filing says. ""Data also was taken from the Company's network. The Company is working to determine what information the data contained and will take other actions as appropriate based on its review."" The company warned that while the incident is actively being managed, ""the event has caused – and may continue to cause – disruption to parts of the Company's business, including certain aspects of its provision of local advertisements by its local broadcast stations on behalf of its customers. The Company is working diligently to restore operations quickly and securely."" Sinclair Broadcast Group says it can't determine whether the event will have a material impact on business operations and that the investigation is ongoing. It is not known who is behind the cyberattack or whether Sinclair Broadcast Group paid the ransom. The company responded to ABC News with a statement similar to what was in the SEC filing, and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency referred ABC News to Sinclair. Two major ransomware incidents targeting critical infrastructure sectors in the United States have occurred already this year. Meat supplier JBS, which was the victim of a ransomware attack over Memorial Day weekend, paid $11 million in bitcoins to the hackers that penetrated their system, the company announced. The FBI attributed the cyberattack to REvil and Sodinokibi, two criminal organizations thought to be based in Russia. Colonial Pipeline, which transports approximately 45% of all fuel consumed on the East Coast, paid millions of dollars to the cybercriminal group DarkSide following a ransomware attack in May that led the pipeline to briefly shut down its operations, according to court documents. The Justice Department announced it successfully seized some of the cryptocurrency that Colonial paid to the hackers. The Darkside criminal organization operates in Eastern Europe and Russian intelligence has been known to cooperate with Eastern European cybercriminals in the past. Both the Director of the FBI Christopher Wray and Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas touched on the cyber threat, including dark web efforts to hack and sell people's personal information, before a congressional panel in September. Mayorkas noted that ransomware incidents were up in 2020. ""Last year, victims paid an estimated $350 million in ransoms, a 311% increase over the prior year, with the average payment exceeding $300,000,"" he said. Wray said the FBI was investigating over 100 incidents of ransomware. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency Director Jenn Easterly called the ransomware problem an ""epidemic"" that will require international help and cooperation. ""If a highly dedicated, sophisticated state actor wants to own you they will, but there are things that people can do to keep themselves safe,"" she explained. The CISA director said over 90% of successful cyberattacks occur because of a phishing email and urged companies to prepare for disruption. Mayorkas said it is difficult to locate and apprehend cybercriminals, but that DHS is ""bringing additional and increasing resources to that effort.""",3,,,,28
2021-10-08,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/biden-signs-law-expand-health-care-havana-syndrome/story?id=80478442,Biden signs law to expand health care for 'Havana syndrome' victims,"President Joe Biden signed into law a bill that provides financial assistance and better health care to victims of ""Havana syndrome,"" the mysterious health incidents affecting dozens of U.S. personnel first identified in Cuba and now including several countries. After a closed-door signing ceremony, Biden said in a statement that his administration is marshalling the U.S. government's ""full resources"" to care for victims and ""to get to the bottom of these incidents, including to determine the cause and who is responsible"" -- a mystery that has confounded U.S. officials for nearly five years now. The HAVANA Act authorizes the CIA director and the secretary of state to provide affected employees with financial support for brain injuries under detailed criteria. It also requires both agencies to report to Congress on how those payments are being made and whether additional action is needed to aid victims. Several affected personnel have complained privately, and in some cases publicly, that they have not been able to access proper medical care -- in some cases questioning whether the U.S. government believes they are injured. ""For far too long, U.S. public servants and their loved ones who've suffered from directed energy attacks have been denied the care they need and deserve. That's unacceptable,"" said Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., one of the law's co-authors who has advocated for victims for years. Its enactment will help ""by removing barriers to critical medical attention and paving the way for personnel with brain injuries to recover,"" she added. American diplomats, spies and other officials have reported strange experiences and debilitating symptoms in several countries now. Symptoms include headaches, dizziness, cognitive difficulties, tinnitus, vertigo and trouble with seeing, hearing, or balancing. Many officials have suffered symptoms years after reporting an incident while some have been diagnosed with traumatic brain injuries. In some cases, especially those first reported in Cuba in late 2016 and throughout 2017, U.S. officials described intense feelings of pressure or vibration and, at times, a screeching or chirping sound. It's unclear how many U.S. officials have confirmed medical symptoms, but new cases have been allegedly reported in several more countries in recent weeks, including India, Serbia and Germany. One reported incident in Vietnam delayed Vice President Kamala Harris's trip there in August. Beyond more than 40 affected staffers in Cuba, the U.S. government has officially acknowledged reported incidents in China, Russia, Uzbekistan, Austria and the United States, although the White House said the vast majority have been reported overseas. ""Addressing these incidents has been a top priority for my Administration. We are bringing to bear the full resources of the U.S. Government to make available first-class medical care to those affected and to get to the bottom of these incidents, including to determine the cause and who is responsible,"" Biden said in his statement Friday. His National Security Council is leading a government-wide probe, while both the CIA and the State Department have their own internal task forces to coordinate their responses, too. Many victims of ""Havana syndrome,"" which the U.S. government now refers to as ""anomalous health incidents,"" have struggled for years to get the health care they seek. Many others, including State Department officials who haven't been affected, have been frustrated by the Trump and Biden administrations' lack of information about reported cases -- instead often learning about reported incidents in the press. In his first note to all staff about the issue in August, Secretary of State Antony Blinken acknowledged the administration ""can and will do a better job keeping you informed of our efforts to get answers, support those affected, and protect our people,"" according to the note, obtained first by ABC News. But the lack of information stems in part from how little the U.S. government knows about what was once referred to as ""health attacks,"" including what is causing them. Last December, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine issued a report that concluded that ""directed, pulsed radio frequency energy appears to be the most plausible mechanism in explaining these cases, especially in individuals with the distinct early symptoms."" CIA Director Bill Burns, who has met with his agency's affected personnel and escalated efforts to solve this mystery, has boosted that finding as well -- telling NPR in July there's ""certainly a very strong possibility"" that some actor is behind the incidents. But last week, the State Department declassified a secret 2018 report that cast doubt on that theory in some corners. Conducted by JASON, an independent scientific advisory group created during the Cold War to consult the U.S. government on defense science and technology, it concluded that radio or microwave energy could not produce the sound recorded by some U.S. diplomats in Cuba and their reported medical symptoms. Instead, it said, the sounds were ""mechanical or biological in origin, rather than electronic. The most likely source is the Indies short-tailed cricket, Anurogryllis celerinictus."" But a senior administration official told BuzzFeed News, which filed a Freedom of Information Act request for the JASON report and first reported on it, that its findings are ""not aligned with the Biden-Harris administration's understanding of AHI (anomalous health incidents) and it has not informed our response."" Either way, the report -- written before incidents were reported in several other countries -- determined that the sounds themselves were not injuring diplomats and could instead have been ""introduced by an adversary as deception so as to mask an entirely unrelated mode of causing illness in diplomatic personnel.""

2021-09-13,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/International/putin-watches-huge-display-firepower-zapad-war-games/story?id=79997473,Putin watches huge display of firepower during Zapad war games,"MULINO FIRING RANGE, Russia -- Russian President Vladimir Putin watched a huge display of firepower put on by his military Monday when he attended the finale of what is believed to be the largest Russian war games held in Europe since the Cold War. The joint exercises with Belarus -- called Zapad -- take place every four years and their main phase began last week, involving tens of thousands of troops and hundreds of tanks, aircrafts and warships at sites across western Russia and in Belarus. Zapad -- which means ""West"" in Russian -- is intended to test the country's ability to fight a major war with NATO on its western border. The exercise has its origins in the Cold War, but in recent years as relations have worsened with the West, Putin has increased their scale, using them to illustrate restored Russian power. Russia has claimed this year's exercises involve 200,000 troops, but most military analysts believe that is a significant exaggeration, and the real figure is likely something closer to 50,000 to 100,000. Putin on Monday attended what amounted to a heavily scripted, grand finale to the drills which took place at a firing range near Nizhny Novgorod, a city about 300 miles from Moscow. From a grandstand overlooking the Mulino range, Putin watched the event through a pair of binoculars, while heavily armed snipers kept guard. For 45 minutes, Russian troops unleashed a colossal barrage, involving howitzers, multiple rocket launchers and dozens of tanks and armored vehicles, while warplanes and helicopters flew in waves overhead. In the exercise, the Russian-led force was defending against a military belonging to a notional enemy, named ""the westerners."" Besides Russian and Belarusian troops, small contingents from India, Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, Mongolia and Armenia also participated. The display watched by Putin appeared notably larger than that put on in 2017, at the last Zapad exercises -- and those drills rattled nerves in eastern Europe, amid overheated speculation that they might be used to cover an imminent Russian invasion. This year's exercises attracted much less media attention, despite a more tense political atmosphere in Belarus following the mass protests against authoritarian leader Alexander Lukashenko. Lukashenko's crushing of the peaceful protests, with Russia's support, has placed him and Moscow in confrontation with European countries and the United States. Since Lukashenko sought rescue from the Kremlin, there have been concerns that Putin will use that leverage to demand he fulfill a long-time Russian goal of integrating Belarus with Russia. Last week, as the exercises began, Putin and Lukashenko announced plans for significantly deeper economic integration, under the slogan ""Two countries, one economy."" With Lukashenko now dependent on Russian support to remain in power, both sides are using the drills to emphasize Moscow's strong backing of the Belarusian leader. ""It is in Minsk's interest to invite a much larger Russian footprint as a show of support for the regime,"" Michael Kofman, director of the Russia Studies Program at the Center for Naval Analyses, wrote in an article for the website War on the Rocks last week. ""Judging from early deployments and training range selection, a more sizable Russian contingent will be in Belarus and Russian troops will be much closer to the borders with Poland than they were during previous Zapad exercises,"" said Kofman. The exercise's imagined scenario simulated Russia helping Belarus to defend against an attack by three fictional states, ""Nyaris,"" ""Pomoria"" and the ""Polar Republic"" -- thinly disguised versions of Lithuania, Poland and a Scandinavian country. Lukashenko has claimed the protests against him are part of a planned invasion of Belarus by NATO countries, repeatedly making wild claims last year that western forces were massed on the border. This year's Zapad drills appeared partly to incorporate that scenario, including scripts where western-backed ""terrorists"" provoked instability, as a pretext for invasion. Belarus' neighbors Poland and Lithuania have expressed unease about the exercises again this year. Both countries are already struggling with a migration crisis engineered by Lukashenko in relation to their support for pro-democracy opposition. In recent months, European officials have accused Lukashenko of flying in thousands of migrants, mostly from Iraq, and pushing them across the border. The exercises, though important for training, are also in many ways also a campaign tool for Putin. Stephen Ganyard, a former Deputy Assistant Secretary of State and ABC News contributor said the shows of force are ""mostly for domestic consumption."" The dramatic show on Monday came just four days before Russia's parliamentary elections. Military experts have cautioned against accepting Russia's claims about the size of the exercises, which they warn are partly intended to give an exaggerated impression of Russian military power. ""Russian military leaders likely hope Western media will report exaggerated figures, which help validate the scale and success of the exercise,"" Kofman wrote. NATO has also accused Russia of failing to formally declare the real number of troops involved. A 1990 agreement, the Vienna Document, obliges Russia to invite observers from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) for exercises involving more than 13,000 troops. But despite its public statements that 200,000 are taking part, Russia has circumvented the rule by claiming fewer than 13,000 troops are participating in each individual drill. Russia has insisted the exercises are entirely defensive and at firing ranges last week Russian commanders were careful to repeat the drills were not intended to be threatening. ""We didn't want to worry anyone,"" said Col. Alexander Zavasky, the commander of an airborne unit drilling in Kaliningrad, told ABC News on Saturday. ""It's a pre-planned exercise, and so, don't worry.""",29,,,,27
2021-08-24,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/case-havana-syndrome-vietnam-delays-vice-president-harriss/story?id=79618335,Possible case of 'Havana syndrome' in Vietnam delays Vice President Harris' visit,"Vice President Kamala Harris' visit to Vietnam on Tuesday was interrupted by a report of an ""anomalous health incident,"" the U.S. Embassy in Hanoi said in a statement -- the latest case of the mysterious onset of medical symptoms more commonly referred to as ""Havana syndrome."" This is the first public report of an incident in Vietnam and the first publicly reported case involving a senior U.S. leader's travel overseas. The source of the unexplained health incidents, which now number over 130 possible cases, remains unknown, vexing U.S. officials amid multiple investigations and task forces by the CIA, State Department and National Security Council, which is leading a government-wide probe. It's been nearly five years since State Department, CIA and other personnel at the U.S. Embassy in Havana first reported strange experiences, like feelings of pressure or vibration and a screeching sound and debilitating symptoms, including headaches, nausea, cognitive deficits and trouble with seeing, hearing or balancing. Several officials have been diagnosed with traumatic brain injuries. Since then, cases have been reported in several other countries, including China, Uzbekistan, Russia, Austria, Germany and the United States, although it's unclear how many U.S. officials have confirmed medical symptoms. ""While this is not a confirmed case at this point in time, we take any reported incident ... quite seriously,"" said White House press secretary Jen Psaki, adding that the incident was reported recently and affected one U.S. staffer at the embassy, not a member of the vice president's team. ""It was an individual who was in country and had been reported previously,"" Psaki added, saying a security assessment was conducted and decided that Harris could travel ahead. The vice president was set to arrive in Hanoi Tuesday during a tour of Southeast Asia, but her departure from Singapore was delayed by over three hours. She arrived several hours later, ignoring reporters' shouted questions on the tarmac. ""She is well. All is fine,"" Harris's spokesperson Symone Sanders told reporters before her departure from Singapore. It's unclear how many health incidents have been reported at the U.S. mission in Vietnam, but it was a single incident that caused concern among Harris' team and the embassy. ""The Vice President's office was made aware of a report of a recent possible anomalous health incident in Hanoi, Vietnam. After careful assessment, the decision was made to continue with the Vice President's trip,"" according to the U.S. Embassy's statement. The administration has declined to provide more information, including when the incident took place or whether the official was medically evacuated. A State Department spokesperson told ABC News that the agency is ""aware of reports of possible UHIs (unexplained health incidents) in Vietnam"" -- another term they use internally for ""Havana syndrome"" cases -- but declined to speak to individual cases, including whether anyone was evacuated. But the spokesperson said for Havana syndrome cases, a medevac is not necessarily specialized transportation out of the country, but ""a consultation in the United States, or another medical center of excellence, to ascertain the best appropriate care."" Last week, the State Department confirmed that it was aware of reported cases at the U.S. mission in Germany. Spokesperson Ned Price told reporters that they ""vigorously investigate"" all ""unexplained health incidents and provide ""immediate and appropriate attention and care"" to employees who report one. Many U.S. officials have grown frustrated with leadership, during both the Trump and Biden administrations, for a lack of information about reported cases or for not being proactive enough in providing treatment and care. In his first note to all staff about the issue, Secretary of State Antony Blinken acknowledged the administration ""can and will do a better job keeping you informed of our efforts to get answers, support those affected, and protect our people,"" according to the note, obtained first by ABC News. But the lack of information stems in part from how little the U.S. government knows about what was once referred to as ""health attacks,"" including what is causing them. Last December, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine issued a report that concluded that ""directed, pulsed radio frequency energy appears to be the most plausible mechanism in explaining these cases, especially in individuals with the distinct early symptoms."" The CIA, State Department and Pentagon all have their own internal task forces to address cases among their personnel and search for possible clues into the causes. The State Department's is overseen by Pamela Spratlen, a two-time ambassador, while the CIA assigned a veteran officer critical to the agency's efforts to find Osama bin Laden to now head its cell. In addition, the State Department started a pilot program to begin recording baseline medical information of personnel and their adult family members before they move to U.S. diplomatic posts overseas. Similarly, the CIA has tripled the number of full-time medical personnel focused on the issue, according to its director Bill Burns. He told NPR last month that while the symptoms are ""real, and it's serious,"" the agency still has no definitive answers on the cause.

Blinken committed to meeting ""soon"" with staff and families affected by what's commonly called ""Havana syndrome,"" after the first cluster of cases were reported in Cuba's capital in late 2016. Amid some complaints that the department has not been proactive enough in addressing their health challenges or other issues, the note, obtained first by ABC News, acknowledged some shortcomings in sharing information with the department's 70,000 employees and supporting those who have been impacted. ""Those of you who've been directly affected are urgently seeking clarity. Employees going abroad are anxious about whether they or their families are at risk. That's completely understandable, and I wish we had more answers for you,"" wrote Blinken. ""We can and will do a better job keeping you informed of our efforts to get answers, support those affected, and protect our people,"" he added. President Joe Biden's National Security Council is leading a government-wide investigation into what is causing the incidents and who may be behind them. But so far, U.S. officials have few answers, nearly five years after State Department, CIA and other personnel at the U.S. Embassy in Havana reported strange experiences, like feelings of pressure or vibration and a screeching sound, and debilitating symptoms, including headaches, nausea, cognitive deficits, and trouble with seeing, hearing, or balancing. Several officials have been diagnosed with traumatic brain injuries, although it's unclear how many - just one piece of data that diplomats are seeking from the department, along with the number and location of reported incidents, CNN reported this week. Beyond Cuba, cases have been reported in several other countries, including China, Uzbekistan, Russia, Austria and the United States, although the White House has said the ""vast majority"" have been reported overseas. ""The investigation into what's causing these incidents and how we can protect our people is ongoing,"" Blinken wrote in his message. Last December, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine issued a report that concluded that ""directed, pulsed radio frequency energy appears to be the most plausible mechanism in explaining these cases, especially in individuals with the distinct early symptoms."" The CIA, State Department, and Pentagon all have their own internal task forces to address cases among their personnel and search for possible clues into the causes. The State Department's is overseen by Pamela Spratlen, a two-time ambassador whom Blinken said reports directly to him, while the CIA assigned a veteran officer critical to the agency's efforts to find Osama bin Laden to now head its cell. In addition, the State Department started a pilot program in June to begin recording baseline medical information of personnel and their adult family members before they move to U.S. diplomatic posts overseas. One month earlier, Deputy Secretary for Management and Resources Brian McKeon sent a cable to all staff urging them to report possible incidents or symptoms immediately, adding, ""There is no stigma associated with reporting, and that every report will be taken seriously by our health and security professionals, and the leadership of the Department."" McKeon and Spratlen have both met affected staffers and family members, but Blinken has not yet and, until Thursday, had not addressed the issue in a department-wide memo. His spokesperson Ned Price said last month that it was one of the first issues he requested a briefing on during the transition - adding, ""These health incidents have been a priority for Secretary Blinken since his day one."" CIA Director Bill Burns has met with affected personnel and made the issue a top priority, tripling the number of full-time medical personnel focused on it, he told NPR two weeks ago. While the symptoms are ""real, and it's serious,"" he added, the agency still has no definitive answers on the cause. An internal State Department report, declassified and released in February, found the agency's initial response was severely botched, ""characterized by a lack of senior leadership, ineffective communications, and systemic disorganization,"" it said.

The U.S. government still has not reached a conclusion into the cause of the incidents, sometimes known as ""Havana syndrome"" after the first cluster of cases was reported at the U.S. embassy in Cuba. But more reported cases are now being investigated at the embassy in Austria's capital, Vienna, according to the State Department, whose spokesperson said Monday that it is ""vigorously investigating reports of possible unexplained health incidents"" among U.S. personnel there. Austria is just the latest country where incidents have now been reported. The National Security Council is overseeing a government-wide review ""to ascertain whether there may be previously unreported incidents that fit a broader pattern,"" White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Monday, and ""whether they constitute an attack of some kind by a foreign actor."" Beyond that review, the intelligence community also established the new panel of experts earlier this month -- bringing together senior officers from the CIA, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and outside scientific and medical experts -- to explore the multiple hypotheses into what is causing the ""health incidents,"" an intelligence official told ABC News. It's the latest federal government review into an issue that has vexed officials since 2016 when the first cases were reported in Cuba, underscoring how little U.S. officials still know about it. The new panel will build off of the findings of a report by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine last December, according to the official, which concluded that ""directed, pulsed radio frequency energy appears to be the most plausible mechanism in explaining these cases, especially in individuals with the distinct early symptoms."" Dozens of U.S. officials have been diagnosed with injuries, including traumatic brain injuries, after reporting strange experiences like high-pitched sounds or feelings of pressure or vibration, or debilitating symptoms including headaches, nausea, cognitive deficits, and trouble with seeing, hearing, or balancing. Before Austria, the U.S. government had acknowledged, in public or in declassified documents, reported cases in Cuba, China, Uzbekistan, Russia, and the United States, although the White House has said ""the vast majority"" of cases have been reported overseas. The top Democrat and Republican on the Senate Intelligence Committee warned in May that the ""pattern of attacking our fellow citizens serving our government appears to be increasing."" ""In coordination with our interagency partners, we are vigorously investigating reports of possible unexplained health incidents among the U.S. embassy community there"" in Vienna, State Department spokesperson Ned Price said Monday. The agency has declined to provide more details, including the number of affected personnel. But according to The New Yorker magazine, which first reported on the Vienna cluster, it totals around two dozen U.S. diplomats, intelligence officers and other government officials -- now second only to Havana. A CIA spokesperson told ABC News that director Bill Burns ""is personally engaged with personnel affected by anomalous health incidents and is highly committed to their care and to determining the cause of these incidents"" but declined to provide more details. Both the CIA and the State Department have elevated their internal task forces investigating reported incidents among their personnel, while the State Department has its own team of medical experts that responds to reported incidents around the world.",3,,,,8
2021-07-19,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/us-nato-expose-china-malicious-cyber-activities/story?id=78919558,"US, NATO to 'expose' China for 'malicious cyber activities'","The United States, several allies and partners and NATO are joining forces to “expose and criticize” China for a “pattern of malicious cyber activities,” announcing on Monday that China is profiting off some of the cyberattacks it's supported, and officially saying it was behind the Microsoft Exchange server breach in March. “We will show how the PRC [People's Republic of China] MSS, Ministry of State Security, uses criminal contract hackers to conduct unsanctioned cyber operations globally, including for their own personal profit,” senior administration officials said on a call with reporters Sunday night. “Their operations include criminal activities such as cyber-enabled extortion, cryptojacking and theft of victims around the world for financial gain. Officials said they also know of some “government-affiliated cyber operators conducting ransomware operations against private companies that have included ransom demands of millions of dollars.” Senior officials said they found the MSS-affiliated ransomware attacks to be ""surprising"" and gave them ""new insights"" into how the MSS operates and the ""aggressive behavior"" coming out of China. Asked how the tactics from the Chinese differ from similar attacks they see coming out of Russia, senior officials said they sometimes see ""some connection"" between Russian intelligence services and individuals, but “the MSS use of criminal contract hackers to conduct unsanctioned cyber operations globally is distinct."" Joining the U.S. in this public announcement is the European Union, United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Japan and NATO. It’s the first time NATO has condemned Chinese cyber activities. The FBI, NSA and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency released a list Monday of tactics, procedures and techniques used by Chinese state-sponsored cyber actors. Among the trends, officials say these actors are ""using a revolving series of virtual private servers (VPSs) and common open-source or commercial penetration tools.” They are also accused of looking for ways to exploit vulnerabilities in major applications, like “Pulse Secure, Apache, F5 Big-IP, and Microsoft products."" The advisory also states that they are using a ""full array of tactics and techniques to exploit computer networks of interest worldwide and to acquire sensitive intellectual property, economic, political, and military information."" ""Countries around the world are making it clear that concerns regarding the PRC malicious cyber activity is bringing them together to call out those activities, promote network defense in cybersecurity, and act to disrupt threat to our economies and national security,"" a senior administration official said. The group will also formally attribute the Microsoft Exchange server cyberattack in March to China’s Ministry of State Security (MSS) ""with high confidence."" Asked what caused the delay for the U.S. to officially point to China for that attack, a senior administration official said they wanted to work with allies and partners because victims of this attack were not just in the U.S. Officials said they have raised these incidents with senior Chinese government officials and ""are not ruling out further actions to hold the PRC accountable,"" adding that their actions ""threaten security, confidence and stability in cyberspace."" While Monday's message of condemnation against Chinese cyber hacking came from nations around the world, the group noticeably stopped short of imposing economic sanctions or other more concrete consequences. ABC’s Rachel Scott asked White House press secretary Jen Psaki if the U.S. would take such a step alone, or whether the administration feels it would be necessary to move in concert with allies to punish China. ""Yes, we would, of course, like to work with countries and work with our key partners around the world, moving forward and you know, obviously, we can't determine steps and consequences on their behalf. But that is certainly our objective and how we've approached our strategy today,"" Psaki said. Psaki also refuted a question suggesting that the U.S. decided not to impose economic sanctions on China, because the U.S. economy depends so heavily on Chinese imports. ""My point is we are not holding back. We are not allowing any economic circumstance or consideration to prevent us from taking actions where warrant. And also, we reserve the option to take additional actions where warrant as well. This is not the conclusion of our efforts as it relates to cyber activities with China or Russia,"" Psaki insisted. Earlier, asked to compare China's hacking efforts with Russia's cyber attacks, President Biden said that while Russia may be harboring cyber criminals, China might be facilitating their attacks. ""To best of my knowledge, and I'm getting a report tomorrow morning on this, a detailed report. My understanding is that the Chinese government, not unlike the Russian government, is not doing this themselves, but are protecting those who are doing it, and maybe even accommodating them being able to do it. That may be the difference,"" Biden said. Biden also said he's not yet going farther with any punishments for China, including sanctions, because the U.S. has not finished looking into the attacks. ""They're still determining exactly what happened,"" he said of his administration officials. ""The investigation is not finished."" ABC News' Sarah Kolinovsky contributed to this report.",3,,,,6

The discussion, their first since meeting in Switzerland last month for a major summit, comes days after another massive ransomware attack affected as many as 1,500 businesses around the world, according to the software vendor that was impacted. ""I made it very clear to him that the United States expects when a ransomware operation is coming from his -- even though it's not, not sponsored by the state -- we expect him to act if we give him enough information to act on who that is,"" Biden told reporters. Biden added that there will still be U.S. consequences for such attacks, without providing details. A senior administration official said Friday the U.S. would be taking action to respond to the latest cyber attacks in the ""days and weeks ahead."" ""We're not going to telegraph what those actions will be, precisely. Some will be manifest and visible, some of them may not be, but we expect those to take place in the days and weeks ahead,"" the official said. But weeks after their Geneva summit, the president expressed optimism that the two countries, whose relations have hit a low point in recent years over a mountain of different issues, at least now had clear lines of communication. ""We have set up a means of communication now on a regular basis to be able to communicate to one another when each of us thinks something is happening in the other country that affects the home country -- and so, it went well,"" Biden said of the call. When asked what actions he wanted or expected Putin to take against the cyberattacks, Biden demurred. ""It's not appropriate for me to say what I expect him to do now. But we'll see,"" The president told reporters. The Kremlin said in its own readout that the two presidents ""stressed the need for substantive and constructive cooperation in the field of cybersecurity and the continuation of relevant contacts."" The White House has said there's no indication the Russian government is responsible for this latest ransomware attack, in which hackers from the cyber criminal group REvil infiltrated IT management companies and their corporate clients through the software vendor Kaseya. The firm said 50 of its customers were directly compromised, but as many as 1,500 businesses that rely on those 50 customers for IT security could be compromised. REvil is believed to be based in Russia or Eastern Europe and was responsible for the hack of JBS, the world's largest meat processor, that took facilities offline and affected meat supplies, including in the U.S. The group demanded a $70 million bitcoin payment from the victims of the Kaseya attack. While the Russian government may not be involved, it has consistently denied responsibility for its own cyberattacks, from its interference in the 2016 U.S. elections to the massive SolarWinds hack that affected dozens of government ministries, private companies and other entities around the world, including nearly a dozen U.S. agencies. ""Despite the readiness of the Russian side to jointly suppress criminal manifestations in the information space, no appeals on these issues have been received by the competent US agencies over the past month,"" the Kremlin said Friday. A senior administration official pushed back on the Kremlin's readout Friday afternoon. ""We have relayed multiple specific requests for action on cybercriminals, to Russia through official channels, and been clear about what Russia's responsibility is, with regard to taking action, including again today at the level of two presidents,"" they said. That language indicated a continued lack of cooperation from the Russian government on the issue. The White House declined to say whether Biden received any new assurances from Putin, referring ABC News' questions to the Kremlin.",3,,,,4

Kaseya, an information technology and management solutions company, said 50 of its 35,000 clients were affected by a ransomware breach. ""While impacting approximately 50 of Kaseya’s customers, this attack was never a threat nor had any impact to critical infrastructure,"" the company said in a statement on Tuesday. ""Many of Kaseya’s customers are managed service providers, using Kaseya’s technology to manage IT infrastructure for local and small businesses with less than 30 employees, such as dentists’ offices, small accounting offices and local restaurants. Of the approximately 800,000 to 1,000,000 local and small businesses that are managed by Kaseya’s customers, only about 800 to 1,500 have been compromised."" It's unknown who carried out the ransomware attack on Kaseya. It's not just critical infrastructure being targeted. The Republican National Committee said one of its computer system vendors was breached by criminal cyber activity but insists that no RNC data was accessed. “Over the weekend, we were informed that Synnex, a third-party provider, had been breached. We immediately blocked all access from Synnex accounts to our cloud environment. Our team worked with Microsoft to conduct a review of our systems and after a thorough investigation, no RNC data was accessed. We will continue to work with Microsoft, as well as federal law enforcement officials on this matter,"" RNC Chief of Staff Richard Walters said in a statement to ABC News. The administration has put a renewed focus on cyber threats after a spate of ransomware attacks disrupted supply chains in various sectors, with the majority coming from hackers based in Russia. ""Even if there are criminal actors, even if it's not the Russian government that attacks our critical infrastructure or our country through cyberattacks, we reserve the option to take action if they won't do it on their own,"" White House press secretary Jen Psaki said on MSNBC Wednesday morning. ""The president reserves that option, meeting with some of his national security experts this morning to get an update, to have a discussion about ransomware, and we'll see what we learn from there."" In May, one of the nation's largest pipeline companies, Colonial Pipeline, was hit with a ransomware attack, which prompted the administration to take action. Biden signed an executive order shortly after the hack, which was aimed at modernizing the federal government's response to cyberattacks by ""improving information-sharing between the U.S. government and the private sector on cyber issues,"" improving detection of hacks into federal systems and creating a ""standardized playbook"" for how the government responds to attacks, according to the White House. In addition to the executive order, the Department of Homeland Security mandated that pipeline companies report cyber breaches to federal authorities within 12 hours. The directive came from the Transportation Security Administration. Meat supplier JBS has also been hit with a ransomware attack, forcing its meat plants to stop operations for a few days. Both JBS and Colonial Pipeline paid the ransom to get their systems back online. “I made the decision to pay, and I made the decision to keep the information about the payment as confidential as possible,” Colonial Pipeline CEO Joesph Blunt told a Senate Committee in June. ""It was the hardest decision I made in my 39 years in the energy industry, and I know how critical our pipeline is to the country, and I put the interest of the country first.”",3,,,,6
2021-06-14,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/nato-updating-common-defense-pact-deal-global-cyberattacks/story?id=78271735,How NATO is updating its common defense pact to deal with global cyberattacks,"President Joe Biden and leaders from the 30 countries that now make up NATO, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, agreed at their summit in Brussels ""that the impact of significant malicious cumulative cyber activities might, in certain circumstances, be considered as amounting to an armed attack,"" an assessment that could lead the organization to invoke its mutual self-defense clause -- or Article 5. Amid the growing cyber threat, Biden on Monday called NATO's Article 5 ""a sacred obligation"" that is ""rock solid and unshakable."" The NATO alliance and its pledge to the common defense of member nations was originally intended to deter armed aggression from the Soviet Union following World War II. The idea then was the allies could join forces to defend against an air or ground invasion. Over the past few years, though, NATO has broadened the threat to include cyberattacks -- and recent ones on the U.S. -- emanating Biden has said, from Russia -- have created a new urgency on how to address the problem. ""Cyber threats to the security of the Alliance are becoming more frequent, complex, destructive and coercive,"" NATO said in April. ""NATO will continue to adapt to the evolving cyber threat landscape. NATO and its Allies rely on strong and resilient cyber defences to fulfill the Alliance’s core tasks of collective defence, crisis management and cooperative security. The Alliance needs to be prepared to defend its networks and operations against the growing sophistication of the cyber threats and attacks it faces."" In fact, NATO now regularly conducts cyberdefense exercises as well as the more traditional ones involving tanks and troops. But while a military incursion -- and how the allies should respond -- might be relatively clear, what constitutes a cyberattack serious enough to necessitate a joint response could be less so, especially if, as is often the case, it is difficult to trace its origin, which could range from a ""state actor"" to a criminal gang. Here's what you need to know about the key section of the treaty. What is Article 5? The key section of the NATO treaty -- of which 30 countries have now signed onto since the organization was formed by 12 founding countries in 1949 -- is Article 5. Article 5 commits each member state to consider an armed attack against one member state to be an armed attack against them all. When it comes to security, Article 5 is where the weight of the alliance lies. Has it been invoked before? Yes -- but only once. NATO invoked Article 5 in response to the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, committing its support to the U.S. ""I constantly remind Americans that when America was attacked for the first time on its shores since what happened back at the end of World War II, NATO stepped up,"" Biden said in a meeting with NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg in Brussels, referencing the terror attacks. ""NATO stepped up, and they honored Article 5."" On Sept. 12, 2001, NATO unanimously passed a four-paragraph resolution to reflect its understanding that the threats to global security had changed radically since the alliance was founded. What's changing? ""Reaffirming NATO’s defensive mandate, the Alliance is determined to employ the full range of capabilities at all times to actively deter, defend against, and counter the full spectrum of cyber threats, including those conducted as part of hybrid campaigns, in accordance with international law,"" a NATO summit communique said. ""We reaffirm that a decision as to when a cyber attack would lead to the invocation of Article 5 would be taken by the North Atlantic Council on a case-by-case basis. Allies recognise that the impact of significant malicious cumulative cyber activities might, in certain circumstances, be considered as amounting to an armed attack."" ""We will make greater use of NATO as a platform for political consultation among Allies, sharing concerns about malicious cyber activities, and exchanging national approaches and responses, as well as considering possible collective responses. If necessary, we will impose costs on those who harm us,"" the joint communique said. That aligns with how White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan on Sunday detailed Article 5 would be updated to deal with the growing global threat of cyberattacks. ""This would be on a case-by-case basis,"" he said. ""And the notion is that if someone gets hit by a massive cyberattack, and they need technical or intelligence support from another ally to be able to deal with it, they could invoke Article 5 to be able to get that."" While it's unclear how exactly how severe a cyberattack would need to be to trigger Article 5, NATO leaders have said, ""Cyber threats to the security of the Alliance are complex, destructive, coercive, and becoming ever more frequent. This has been recently illustrated by ransomware incidents and other malicious cyber activity targeting our critical infrastructure and democratic institutions, which might have systemic effects and cause significant harm."" The communique comes as the U.S. has been hit with several cyberattacks in recent weeks, including the Colonial Pipeline attack that disrupted the U.S. gasoline supply, some believed to have been caused by bad actors in Russia. With the wind of NATO behind him, Biden is expected to break up the cyberattacks in his meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday. What has Biden said versus Trump? Biden, sitting outside NATO headquarters with the secretary-general Monday, called Article 5 a ""sacred obligation"" and one that is ""rock solid and unshakable"" to the U.S. ""NATO is critically important for U.S. Interest in and of itself,"" he said. ""If there weren't one, we'd have to invent one. It is--It allows America to conduct its business around the world in a way that never would have occurred were it not for NATO."" Biden's endorsement of NATO stands in stark contrast to his predecessor, former President Donald Trump, who called the alliance ""obsolete,"" which he later backtracked, and once declined to endorse Article 5, which has been a key tenet of the alliance since it was created in 1949.

2021-06-09,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/US/cybersecurity-experts-break-cyberattack-increasing-threat/story?id=78182992,Cybersecurity experts break down a cyberattack as they become increasing threat,"The U.S. government and American businesses have found themselves on the defensive lately as cyberattacks have threatened critical infrastructure, the food supply chain and people's personal data. In hopes of preempting an attack, some businesses have hired groups, known as red teams, to hack into their systems like would-be terrorists and expose cybersecurity weaknesses. Brian Halbach and Jonathan Studebaker, two of these hackers, spoke to ""Nightline"" while ""targeting"" two different companies in two nights. ""The bad guys, they're getting more sophisticated,"" Halbach, a security consultant at RedTeam Security, said. ""They're coming up with new ways, new tricks of their trade. ... So, businesses also have to react fast and they have to think fast."" After a ransomware attack against the Metropolitan Police Department in Washington, D.C., last month, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas warned that cyberattacks, particularly ransomware attacks, had increased 300% in the past year. He said these cyberterrorists have targeted everything from government agencies to small businesses, and that $350 million in ransom had been paid for these attacks in 2020. ""We're not talking about people with a conscience,"" Mayorkas told ABC News' Pierre Thomas. ""We're talking about criminals who want to make money illegally."" Watch the full story on ""Nightline"" TONIGHT at 12:35 a.m. ET on ABC. Just this week, the Department of Justice announced that it had seized millions of dollars in Bitcoin that the Colonial Pipeline had paid as a ransom to the cybercriminal group DarkSide after last month's ransomware attack forced the company to temporarily shut down operations. ""DarkSide is a ransomware group that is believed to be based largely in Russia. ... They develop malicious code that can then be used to deploy within a network and encrypt all the data, and then supply all of the infrastructure to facilitate ransom payments, negotiation with victims, and then they basically franchise it out to lots of different affiliates,"" said Dmitri Alperovitch, former chief technology officer of cybersecurity company CrowdStrike. Colonial transports approximately 45% of all fuel consumed on the East Coast. Every day, 100 million gallons of fuel move through the pipeline between Houston and New York City. Panic-buying led Americans to rush to fill their tanks with gas as it became more expensive. Javed Ali, a former senior director of counterterrorism for the National Security Council, said there was a ""sort of anxiety of not knowing when gas supplies would come back in a neighborhood or a city."" ""So, these are all really tough, not only business decisions, but decisions that have cascading effects throughout the country,"" said Ali, who is now the Townsley Foundation policymaker in residence at the University of Michigan Ford School of Public Policy. The FBI exposed the group behind the attack as DarkSide two days after the attack had occurred. Three days later, Colonial announced that it had resumed operations. It wasn't long before the company also confirmed that it had paid the $4.4 million ransom in Bitcoin -- a decision that company CEO Joseph Blount made begrudgingly. ""I made the decision to pay and I made the decision to keep the information about the payment as confidential as possible. It was the hardest decision I've made in my 39 years in the energy industry,"" Blount told the Senate Homeland Security Committee on Tuesday. ""There are two types of companies out there: Those that know that they've been attacked and those that don't yet know that they've been hacked, and that's been the reality of the last 10 years,"" said Alperovitch. ""That continues to scale up as we're seeing the attacks become more and more disruptive and destructive."" In his interview with ABC News, Mayorkas said that fortifying cybersecurity across the country is ""not really a choice."" ""It's an imperative because the vulnerability that one has, it creates a threat not only for oneself but for many others with whom one is connected,"" he said. ""We always say in the cybersecurity realm, we're only as strong as our weakest link, because everything is connected. The vulnerability of one can become the vulnerability of many."" As more companies work to build their defenses against hackers, Halbach said red teams like his are up against hackers who are at the ""top of the top"" level of expertise. ""We [are] kind of at the point where if they want to get in, they are going to get in, and they are very persistent,"" he said. ""Essentially, they can just keep attacking and attacking and attacking, and if it doesn't work one day, they can spend three weeks doing these advanced attacks until they get in. Eventually, they will find that weakness in the armor and get in."" Their work also focuses on companies' physical security by trying to prevent bad actors from stealing devices where they're located. ""I think that oftentimes we put a lot of faith in preventing people from getting in digitally, so we'll have a firewall and we'll have antivirus and we've got all these security controls in place for the digital world,"" said Studebaker, who also previously worked for RedTeam Security. ""But in the office itself, they are usually a little bit more lax because you are going in there to work. It is a safe environment. You are there with coworkers and you think the bad guys are out -- that they are not going to come in."" ""But there is that potential that if they do have physical access, because your guard is down, because it's this nice safe space, that in some ways actually makes it more vulnerable,"" he continued. ""They could steal things like hard drives or plug into the network and get access to the entire network."" Halbach and Studebaker brought ""Nightline"" along as they tested two companies' defenses against potential hackers. The first company, Intereum Inc., is a commercial furniture supplier in Plymouth, Minnesota. With no external networks to hack, the team looked to break into the building, trudging through thick woods in the dark of the night to find a blind spot in the company's security cameras. Although they were able to break in, they were soon caught by the security cameras inside the building. Still, with their mission to expose all of the weaknesses, they continued on toward the server room, where Halbach looked to gain access to the company's servers. ""I'm connecting to their internal switch here. I'm gonna see if I can connect to an IP address to see if it lets me connect to an internal network, and poke around from there -- see what we can do on the network,"" Halbach said while executing the task. The team also carried USB drives loaded with ransomware viruses, which they planned to use on unlocked computers. When they found one that granted the USB access, Studebaker took a picture to document the potential network access. ""This is a Trojan horse that we just detonated here,"" Studebaker said at the time. ""What it did is it called out to our server and now we have remote command and control over their network."" The red team's second target was a digital security company that's also in Minnesota. In the middle of the night, the team used a device called a ""pineapple"" to attempt to deactivate Wi-Fi-enabled cameras outside the building. They also used a specialized tool they'd developed called a Pwnagotchi, modeled after the Tamagotchi toy. The device allows them to knock Wi-Fi-enabled devices off of their networks. When they attempt to reconnect, the Pwnagotchi steals their password data. Unable to break into the company's network from outside the building, the team subsequently worked their way inside, setting off alarms and capturing the attention of security cameras and motion detectors. Still, they carried on into the server room, and within 10 minutes, they had implanted a device known as a ""raspberry pi."" ""The whole point of those raspberry pis ... we would get another one of our red team members -- someone in another place or ourselves the next day -- we can remote back in and just start taking over everything,"" Halbach said. ""As much as we want, we can't steal all of their IP in a single night. We would need multiple days to exfil[trate] gigabytes, terabytes of data, out of the network."" Over the course of about three hours, the team had not only implanted the raspberry pi, but also extracted usernames and passwords from people who worked there. The engagement was scheduled to last until 3 a.m., during which time, police and fire authorities were advised not to respond to alarms. After that time, the building's true alarm system reengaged, forcing the team to make a speedy exit. After two nights of what some might consider cyber war games, both the red team and the companies that hired them walked away more aware and better prepared for hackers with malicious intentions. It's all meant to reinforce the blind spots in the defenses that they've already implemented, according to Halbach. ""A lot of times, they don't know what they don't know,"" Halbach said about companies in general. Studebaker added: ""I think the fact that they come to us as a client at all is an indicator that they want to be proactive -- that they want to be ahead of this. They don't want to be the next headline."" ABC News' Anthony Rivas, Ozren Milharcic, Jack Date, Kevin Rochford, Luke Barr and Alex Mallin contributed to this report.",3,,,,29
2021-06-08,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/US/multiple-major-websites-reporting-outages-worldwide/story?id=78146103,"News outlets, British government site and more hit by widespread outage","A slew of high-traffic websites -- ranging from news outlets to social media platforms -- suffered simultaneous global outages early Tuesday morning. Most of the websites impacted were back up and running after the temporary hit, and the issues were linked to Fastly, a cloud-computing company that supports these sites. The company has not disclosed the cause of the outage. Reddit, Spotify, Twitch, Stack, Hulu, HBO Max, PayPal, Vimeo and Shopify were among the pages to report issues Tuesday. News outlets CNN, The Guardian, The New York Times, BBC and The Financial Times were also impacted, as well as the site for the British government. Nearly 40 websites were hit with outages at some point early Tuesday morning, according to data from the tracking site Down Detector, though it's not clear if all of them were related to the Fastly incident. Fastly reported just before 6 a.m. ET that it was investigating a ""potential impact to performance"" with its content-delivery network services. Within an hour it said it had identified the issue and was implementing a fix. Content delivery networks are an ""obscure part of the internet"" that operate ""like a mail forwarding system,"" according to David Vaskevitch, the former chief technical officer at Microsoft and current CEO of photo organization app Mylio. ""It's not exactly the same but it takes content that's used heavily all over the network and copies it to locations closer to the user,"" Vaskevitch said. ""That offloads the central server so you don't have one computer trying to do it all and it gets rid of network delays by putting the information closer to where it's going to be used."" The fix was applied at 6:36 a.m. ET, Fastly said, and approximately an hour later the company reported that the issue had been resolved globally. ""Fastly has observed recovery of all services and has resolved this incident,"" the company wrote on an incident report landing page. Though the incident was resolved quickly, it sowed widespread confusion and exposed vulnerabilities of critical websites at a time when high-profile cybersecurity breaches are on the rise. While Vaskevitch said he has ""no idea"" what caused the outage, the speed of recovery likely indicates it was an internal error versus a nefarious hack. ""There's so many things that could have happened but the fact that the system came up so quickly means that more likely it was just an unexpected mechanical problem somewhere in their system,"" Vaskevitch said. ""If hackers had gotten in there, [Fastly] may now be starting to realize the extent of the damage and then they'd be saying that they hope to know by the end of the day when they're going to be able to dig their way out of this."" Vaskevitch said he doesn't think people need to be too concerned about temporary outages like this, noting that the internet overall has proven ""very reliable."" ""Ordinary people can't predict the outage, but there are things they can do to make sure they're either not affected or to minimize the effect of an outage,"" he added, suggesting storing important data offline so it can still be accessible in the case of an outage. While Fastly stock dipped briefly during premarket trading, the quick fix seems to have ameliorated investors' concerns. By Tuesday afternoon, shares for Fastly were up nearly 7%.",3,,,,28
2021-06-07,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/doj-seizes-millions-ransom-paid-colonial-pipeline/story?id=78135821,DOJ seizes millions in ransom paid by Colonial Pipeline,"The Justice Department on Monday announced it has successfully seized millions of dollars in cryptocurrency Colonial Pipeline paid to the cyber criminal group DarkSide following last month's ransomware attack that led the pipeline to briefly shut down its operations, according to a seizure warrant unsealed Monday afternoon. ""Earlier today, the Department of Justice has found and recaptured the majority of the ransom Colonial paid to the DarkSide network in the wake of last month's ransomware attack. Ransomware attacks are always unacceptable -- but when they target critical infrastructure, we will spare no effort in our response,"" Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco said at a news conference. ""Today, we turned the tables on DarkSide,"" she said. ""By going after the entire ecosystem that fuels ransomware and digital extortion attacks, including criminal proceeds in the form of digital currency, we will continue to use all of our tools, and all of our resources to increase the cost and the consequences of ransomware attacks and other cyber-enabled attacks."" The Colonial Pipeline hack was carried out by DarkSide actors, the FBI said in brief statement days after the attack. At the time of the attack, President Joe Biden said the hackers were based in Russia, but were not part of the Russian government. Colonial transports approximately 45% of all fuel consumed on the East Coast. The company was up and running within days, but the slowdown meant delays still remained in the aftermath of the attack. In May, the company admitted it paid million ransom in Bitcoin cryptocurrency. ""We needed to do everything in our power to restart the system quickly and safely. The decision was made to pay the ransom,"" the company said. ""This decision was not made lightly, however, one that had to be made. Tens of millions of Americans rely on Colonial -- hospitals, emergency medical services, law enforcement agencies, fire departments, airports, truck drivers and the traveling public. Our focus remains on continued operations to safely deliver refined products to communities we serve.” The company's CEO said last month in an interview that he authorized a payment of $4.3 million to the DarkSide group only hours after the company learned of the attack because executives were not sure how long it might take to bring the pipeline back on. The full amount of the seizure from DarkSide, DOJ officials said Monday, was 63.7 bitcoins valued at approximately $2.3 million. News of the seizure was first reported by CNN. Asked by ABC News whether the seizure would really operate as a deterrent for other hacking groups given it only amounts to roughly half of what Colonial paid in ransom and, given the group operates out of Russia, will not likely face criminal consequences for the attack -- Monaco said she ""wouldn't get ahead of the investigative efforts and full consequences associated with the ongoing investigation. ""The message today is we will bring all of our tools to bear, to go after these criminal networks, including the ecosystem and the illicit and the abuse, frankly, of the online infrastructure that they use in terms of the digital currency to perpetrate these schemes,"" she said. Monaco also used Monday's announcement to urge companies to take preemptive action. ""In this heightened threat landscape, we all have a role to play in keeping our nation safe. No organization is immune. So today I want to emphasize to leaders of corporations and communities alike, the threat of severe ransomware attacks pose a clear and present danger to your organization, to your company, to your customers, to your shareholders, and to your long-term success,"" she warned. ""So pay attention now. Invest resources now. Failure to do so could be the difference between being secure now, or a victim later,"" she said. In an effort to get more cooperation from companies, the Department of Homeland Security announced shortly after Colonial Pipeline was hacked that it will mandate that all pipeline companies report a cyber incident hours after it happens. The directive came from the Transportation Security Administration, an arm of DHS known for protecting the skies that also oversees pipeline security. Companies will be mandated to report pipeline related cyberattacks to the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Administration within 12 hours of the breach; put in place a 24/7 cyber coordinator who can respond to incidents and coordinate with the TSA; and fix the breached pipeline within 30 days and outline a plan to proceed.",3,,,,28
2021-05-28,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/US/kremlin-rejects-microsoft-allegations-carried-hack-state-department/story?id=77958843,Kremlin rejects new Microsoft allegations it carried out hack via State Department email,"The Kremlin has dismissed new allegations from Microsoft that Russian state hackers seized control of the email system of the State Department's international aid agency in order to target dozens of other organizations in the United States and around the world, including human rights groups and other critics of President Vladimir Putin's government. Microsoft on Thursday said the new attack was carried out by the same group of Russian hackers behind the SolarWinds hack of the federal government which has been linked to Russia's foreign intelligence agency, the SVR. The new cyberattack comes only three weeks before a planned summit between Putin and President Joe Biden, who just a month ago imposed sanctions on Russia after the Solar Winds hack. The Kremlin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov on Friday said the allegations from Microsoft were ""unfounded"" and ""abstract"" and said he did not believe it would affect the summit. ""It's an abstract statement. It's like if we said we believe a large threat is coming from Microsoft and the software. It will be the same unfounded accusation,"" Peskov said in a daily briefing call with reporters. Microsoft has said the new attack saw the Russian hackers gain access to an email account belonging to the United States Agency for International Development. From there they were able to then send 3,000 phishing emails to around 150 government agencies, think tanks and NGOs, the company said in a blog post published Thursday. Microsoft said it had observed the attack this week by the group, which it dubs ""Nobelium."" It judged that the goal of the attack appeared to be an intelligence gathering effort by the Russian hackers by targeting government agencies involved in foreign policy. ""These attacks appear to be a continuation of multiple efforts by Nobelium to target government agencies involved in foreign policy as part of intelligence gathering efforts,"" the company said. The attack resembled the Solar Winds hack in that it targeted a third-party private service provider in order to gain access to government agencies, in what is known as a ""supply chain"" attack. In the wake of the Solar Winds attack, Biden signed an executive order that placed new standards for cybersecurity for any software sold to the federal government. In the new attack the Russian hackers gained access to the U.S. Agency for International Development's Constant Contact account, an email marketing service, according to Microsoft. The hackers were then able to send out authentic-looking phishing emails which included a link that if clicked would insert malware into the victim's computer. The malware gave hackers broad capabilities within the system, ranging from from stealing data to infecting other computers on a network, Microsoft said. ""By piggybacking on software updates and now mass email providers,"" the company wrote, the Russian hackers increased ""the chances of collateral damage in espionage operations and undermines trust in the technology ecosystem."" The White House says it, too, is ""aware of the phishing incident"" that impacted USAID and is ""monitoring the situation closely"" -- but noted that so far, the impact ""appears to be limited."" A spokesperson for the White House's National Security Council said: ""NSC is aware of the phishing incident and we are monitoring the situation closely. CISA is actively managing this incident and working with USAID."" The spokesperson said that ""at this time, there appears to be limited impact."" ""We note Microsoft's blog pointing out that many of these emails are likely to have been blocked by automated systems,"" the spokesperson said. ""Improving cybersecurity technology and defenses is the foundational step to fighting cyber attacks."" While Microsoft said in a blog post that a Russian state-backed hacking group, Nobelium, was behind the cyberattack, U.S. intelligence has not yet attributed the attack to anyone. In a statement, USAID acting spokesperson Pooja Jhunjhunwala told ABC News that the government's ""forensic investigation"" is still ongoing. ""The agency has notified and is working with all appropriate Federal authorities,"" added Jhunjhunwala, including the Department of Homeland Security and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency. Biden had sought to signal to Russia that it could pay a more substantial price for such attacks with the sanctions package in April. The measures included expelling 10 Russian diplomats, imposing new restrictions on purchasing Russia's sovereign debt and also sanctioned several Russian cybersecurity companies, among other steps. Russia in retaliation expelled 10 American diplomats and asked the U.S. ambassador to Moscow to return home for an unspecified period for consultations.",3,,,,6
2021-05-14,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/International/irelands-health-service-hit-significant-ransomware-attack/story?id=77685241,Ireland's health service hit by 'significant' ransomware attack,"DUBLIN -- Ireland’s health care system was hit by a major ransomware attack on Friday, forcing its health service to shut down its IT systems and locking many hospitals out of their computers, in what one government minister said was possibly the most serious cyber attack in the country's history. The ransomware attack began overnight, targeting Ireland's Health Service Executive which said it had decided to shut down most of its IT systems as a precaution. Many hospitals and clinics reported on Friday they had lost access to their computer systems -- suddenly shut out of patients' records, appointment booking and email systems -- prompting some to cancel most non-urgent appointments. Those facilities said they had contingency plans in place; medical equipment was not impacted; and care was being given as normal to patients. The health service said the attack was also significantly disrupting Ireland's coronavirus testing program, although it said that its vaccination rollout was not affected. ""It's widespread. It is very significant, and possibly the most significant cybercrime attack on the Irish State,"" Ossian Smith, a state minister for procurement and eCommerce told the national broadcaster RTE on Friday. Smith told RTE that the attack was ""not espionage"" and was the work of a criminal gang seeking to extort money from the country. He said the attack went ""right to the core"" of the health service and that Ireland was now ""deploying everything"" in response. He said Ireland's National Cyber Security Center and police were assisting in containing the attack and launching an investigation into the criminals responsible. Ireland has requested help from Interpol with the investigation. The attack blindsides Ireland's health system amid the coronavirus pandemic and comes amid heightened attention to the threat posed by ransomware attacks following the hack of Colonial Pipeline in the United States that has wrought havoc on fuel supplies. Paul Reid, the head of the Health Service Executive, told RTE radio that it had shut down its systems as a precautionary measure allow to specialists to contain the ransomware and assess the damage. The Irish government's chief information officer said it was working to ensure that ransomware had not spread to any other government networks and that for the time being that did not appear to have happened. Smith said the National Cyber Security Center was now working through the health service's systems by ""clearing through each section, each subunit of the network, and when it's safe, they're reopening."" He said that would continue throughout the weekend, ""and possibly longer,"" The attack disrupted the Ireland health care system's ability to offer outpatient care, forcing some hospitals to suspend many key services, including cancer and stroke treatments as well as testing, such as CT scans. Fergal Malone, the head of Dublin's The Rotunda maternity hospital, said the facility had had to shut down its computer systems after learning they were affected overnight. That meant the hospital had had to revert to paper systems for administration, a slower process he said, resulting in the cancellation of non-urgent appointments, except those for women over 36 weeks pregnant. But for the hospital itself, he said it was able to function “absolutely normally"" for the patients already there. “All patients in the hospital are safe, all care is being provided,” Malone said. Several other major hospitals said they were also seriously affected and canceled non-urgent appointments, although others continued to receive people. The health service's chief operating officer, Anne O'Connor said that if the attack was not overcome by Monday ""we will be in a very serious situation and we will be cancelling many services."" O'Connor said the attack was carried out using ""a brand new variant of the Conti ransomware,"" a type of ransomware known to cybersecurity researchers and different to that involved in the Colonial Pipeline attack. Conti is a so-called ""double extortion"" ransomware, which means that as well as locking victims out of their systems, the malware also steals data, which the criminals then threaten to release if they are not paid. Russian cybersecurity firm, Kaspersky listed Conti as nNo 2 on its list of top ransomware groups and estimates that it accounted for 13% of all ransomware attacks from late 2019 through 2020. Some security researchers have linked Conti to cyber criminal gang believed to operate from Russia. Last month reports emerged that Conti ransomware hackers had encrypted the systems of the Broward County Public School District in Florida and demanded $40 million in ransom. The hackers released some files after the school said it would not pay the amount.",3,,,,6
2021-05-11,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/cisa-obtain-technical-information-colonial-pipeline-hack/story?id=77620866,CISA yet to obtain 'technical information' on Colonial Pipeline hack,"The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) does not have the ""technical information"" on the Colonial Pipeline ransomware attack, the acting director told a congressional panel Tuesday. Colonial Pipeline said on Saturday it was the victim of a cyberattack involving ransomware and had ""proactively"" halted all pipeline operations as a result. The 5,500-mile pipeline system transports approximately 45% of all fuel consumed on the East Coast, according to its website, and runs from Texas to New Jersey. CISA, an arm of the Department of Homeland Security, is responsible for the nation's cyber infrastructure. Brandon Wales, the acting director of CISA, told lawmakers on the Senate Homeland Security Committee that once the agency gets the information, it will be used to help protect other companies. ""We do expect information to come from that and when we have it, we will use it to help improve cybersecurity more broadly,"" he testified. Wales also admitted that the company did not directly reach out to the agency in the moments following the cyber attack. ""We were brought in by the FBI after they were notified about the incident,"" he said. ""I think there is a benefit when CISA is brought in quickly because the information that we glean, we work to share it in a bigger fashion to protect other critical infrastructure,"" he explained. The FBI said in a statement Monday it had been confirmed that DarkSide ransomware was responsible for the compromise of the Colonial Pipeline networks. The FBI added that it will continue to work with the company and government partners on the ongoing investigation. The DarkSide criminal organization allegedly operates in Eastern Europe. While federal officials are still trying to determine whether a foreign nation could be involved in the cyberattack, Russian intelligence has been known to cooperate with Eastern European cybercriminals in the past. President Joe Biden said Monday there is currently ""no evidence"" that Russia is involved in the cyber attack. ""Although, there is evidence that the actors’ ransomware is in Russia,"" the president added. ""They have some responsibility to deal with this."" Wales also said it ""is not surprising"" that DarkSide went after a company like Colonial Pipeline. ""We've seen this over the past two years, they're going after bigger players they get bigger ransoms. Ransoms last year went up to around $300,000 For the small ones and millions of dollars for the big ones,"" he said. Wales got into the challenges in federal government cybersecurity, which is a combination of a lack of updating systems, hiring the right people and that tactics are changing at a fast clip. He urged Congress to add more funding to CISA's budget. Ranking Member Rob Portman said the Colonial Pipeline hack shows how cyber incidents can have real world impacts. ""This is a stark example of how the cyberattacks can have real demonstrable impacts on our economy international security, ask the people who are in East Coast states about what they're paying for gasoline today at the pump, and they will tell you it has impact,"" he said.

2021-05-11,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/top-us-official-hoard-gas-amid-pipeline-shutdown/story?id=77627452,Energy secretary: No need to hoard gasoline amid pipeline shutdown,"The Biden administration on Tuesday warned that southeastern states faced a gasoline ""supply crunch"" following the ransomware attack on the Colonial Pipeline, as several states declared emergencies or suspended rules and one major airline altered its flight routes. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm said that Colonial Pipeline's chief executive had indicated the company would decide by the close of business on Wednesday whether it could fully restart the pipeline, but that even if it did, ""it will take a few days to ramp up operations."" ""Much as there was no cause for, say, hoarding toilet paper at the beginning of the pandemic,"" Granholm told reporters, ""there should be no cause for hoarding gasoline, especially in light of the fact that the pipeline should be substantially operational by the end of this week and over the weekend."" Top federal officials encouraged calm, even as Virginia's governor on Tuesday declared a state of emergency to ""prepare for any potential supply shortages."" His counterpart in North Carolina did the same the day before, while in Georgia, the governor suspended the gas tax and weight limits on trucks transporting fuel. Anecdotally, some gas stations across the southeast faced long lines as motorists stocked up on gas. Granholm said during a news conference at the White House that the federal government would investigate reports of gasoline price gouging and that any ""crunch"" would be short-lived. ""It's not that we have a gasoline shortage,"" Granholm said in an exchange with ABC News Senior White House Correspondent Mary Bruce. ""It's that we have this supply crunch, and that things will be back to normal soon, and that we’re asking people not to hoard."" She added: ""We have gasoline. We just have to get it to the right places."" In the meantime, the secretary said, ""the crunch"" would be felt in the southeast, where much of the Colonial Pipeline is located. The 5,500-mile pipeline system transports approximately 45% of all fuel consumed on the East Coast, according to its website, and runs from Texas to New Jersey. ""It’s about 70% of the supplies of North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Georgia, and especially southern Virginia,"" that, Granholm said, ""are impacted the most.” The FBI said Monday that the DarkSide criminal organization, which operates in Eastern Europe, was allegedly behind the attack. The attack on the Colonial Pipeline ""could prove to be the most devastating ransomware attack on critical infrastructure systems in the U.S. to date,"" according to a bulletin issued Monday by the Department of Homeland Security’s regional office in Boston. While federal officials are still trying to determine whether a foreign nation could be involved in the cyberattack, Russian intelligence has been known to cooperate with Eastern European cybercriminals in the past. President Joe Biden said Monday that the attack was a ""criminal act."" “So far, there is no evidence, based on -- from our Intelligence people that Russia is involved,” Biden told reporters. “Although, there is evidence that the actors’ ransomware is in Russia.

2021-05-10,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/US/colonial-pipeline-ransomware-cyberattack/story?id=77599757,What we know about the Colonial Pipeline ransomware cyberattack,"A cybersecurity attack targeting operators of a major East Coast fuel pipeline has left the nation reeling, exposing the vulnerabilities of critical infrastructure to new threats while also leaving many Americans with more questions than answers. Colonial Pipeline said on Saturday that it was the victim of a cyberattack involving ransomware and had ""proactively"" halted all pipeline operations as a result. The 5,500-mile pipeline system transports approximately 45% of all fuel consumed on the East Coast, according to its website, and runs from Texas to New Jersey. President Joe Biden acknowledged the ransomware attack during remarks on Monday, saying his administration has been tracking the incident ""extremely carefully"" and that he has been ""personally briefed every day"" on it. Eric Goldstein, the executive assistant director for cybersecurity at the Department of Homeland Security’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), told ABC News in an interview on Monday that Americans should not expect any ""shortfalls"" from the hack. ""They expect resolution of this issue in the near future and shortfalls that will affect the American people are not anticipated,"" Goldstein said. Here is what to know about the Colonial Pipeline cyberattack, including the latest on who is behind it and how it could potentially impact gas prices. The Federal Bureau of Investigation confirmed in a statement Monday that Darkside ransomware was responsible for the compromise of the Colonial Pipeline networks. The FBI added that it will continue to work with the company and government partners on the ongoing investigation. The Darkside criminal organization operates in Eastern Europe. While federal officials are still trying to determine whether a foreign nation could be involved in the cyberattack, Russian intelligence has been known to cooperate with Eastern European cybercriminals in the past. ""It is always a concern when any adversary, nation state or criminal group targets an American business or critical infrastructure and particularly, although not exclusively, when that effort results in disruption of a critical function or service,"" CISA's Goldstein told ABC News. ""We are deeply focused on making sure that every organization in this country takes steps to minimize the risks to their networks and has the ability to recover quickly, regardless of the actors involved, because we know that there are so many groups out there that are attempting these kind of intrusions,"" he added. Goldstein did not say whether authorities have identified Darkside as working for a foreign country. President Biden said during remarks Monday that there is currently ""no evidence"" that Russia is involved in the cyberattack. ""Although, there is evidence that the actors’ ransomware is in Russia,"" the president added. ""They have some responsibility to deal with this."" Colonial Pipeline said in a statement Monday that it is executing a phased plan to incrementally return to service, with ""the goal of substantially restoring operational service by the end of the week."" The company said it will be providing updates as the restoration efforts progress. ""Restoring our network to normal operations is a process that requires the diligent remediation of our systems, and this takes time,"" the company said. ""In response to the cybersecurity attack on our system, we proactively took certain systems offline to contain the threat, which temporarily halted all pipeline operations, and affected some of our IT systems. To restore service, we must work to ensure that each of these systems can be brought back online safely."" Patrick DeHaan, the head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy, told ABC News Monday that the pipeline shutdown will likely not impact the price at the pump for most Americans. ""It certainly creates some logistical challenges in the Southeast, and it may create price increases modestly in the Southeast, but there is not an impending spike coming nationally,"" he said. ""This is not an outage of a refinery that produces gasoline and so supply is not disrupted for the rest of the nation that is not served by the Colonial Pipeline."" ""This is evolving, but for now this is not going to be a national issue or have a national effect on gas prices,"" he added. DeHaan predicts that motorists along the Southeast, from northern Florida to Virginia, may see slight increases of between 5 to 15 cents per gallon at most. For now, DeHaan recommends that drivers in these areas conserve as much as possible, which could help ""bring a much more rapid conclusion to this once the pipeline reopens."" ""My advice to motorists is not to panic buy and make the situation much worse,"" DeHaan added. ""If motorists do panic and rush out to fill up that could make prices spike more significantly and make outages more severe."" Homeland Security Advisor and Deputy National Security Advisor Elizabeth Sherwood-Randal said during a White House press briefing Monday that the Biden administration is assisting Colonial through a ""whole of government effort"" involving a slew of agencies being led by the Department of Energy. ""Colonial is responsible for safely returning the pipeline to service, and our role in the federal government is to take proactive steps to analyze the impacts of the shutdown on the delivery of gasoline, diesel and aviation fuel in states that are dependent on the pipeline, and to identify federal options for alleviating supply shortfalls, should they develop,"" Sherwood-Randal said. ""For example, to help address potential supply disruptions, the Department of Transportation issued an hours-of-service waiver yesterday, which provides greater flexibility to drivers transporting gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, and other refined petroleum products across 17 states as well as the District of Colombia,"" she added. She emphasized there is not a supply shortage currently. Deputy National Security Advisor for Cyber and Emerging Technologies Anne Neuberg said at the same press briefing that they are ""actively engaged with the company and offering support as needed to restore their systems."" ""Right now, they've not asked for cyber support from the federal government, but we remain available to meet their cybersecurity needs,"" she added. Neuberg demurred when asked if Colonial had paid a ransom to the hackers, saying, ""Colonial is a private company, and we’ll defer information regarding their decision on paying a ransom to them.""",3,,,,28

The source of the illnesses, known as ""Havana syndrome"" after the first cluster of cases at the U.S. Embassy in Cuba, is still unknown. But there is growing pressure from Congress to figure out what has affected so many U.S. diplomats, spies and other officials -- and who or what is behind it. ""At this point, at this moment, we don't know the cause of these incidents, which are both limited in nature and the vast majority of which have been reported overseas,"" said White House press secretary Jen Psaki, acknowledging the newly reported cases in the U.S. The Biden administration has launched a review of U.S. intelligence to determine if there are other previously unreported cases and if there is a ""broader pattern,"" a National Security Council spokesperson confirmed to ABC News. Last month, U.S. defense officials briefed lawmakers on the Senate and House Armed Services Committees on several previously unreported incidents of U.S. personnel falling sick after alleged exposures, congressional sources confirmed to ABC News. Dozens of Americans have been diagnosed with a range of symptoms, including traumatic brain injuries, with several describing bizarre experiences like strange noises and sensations. The U.S. government has acknowledged cases in Cuba, China, Uzbekistan and Russia -- but there are media reports of other countries now, too. The issue has vexed U.S. officials since 2016, when the first cases were reported at the embassy in Havana. While there's still no definitive answer, the National Academies of Science in December issued a report, commissioned by the State Department, that concluded the most likely source is ""directed, pulsed radio frequency energy."" Among the possible new cases are also reportedly at least two incidents in the Washington area, according to GQ magazine, CNN and others. ABC News has not independently verified those reports. ""This pattern of attacking our fellow citizens serving our government appears to be increasing,"" the top Democrat and Republican on the Senate Intelligence Committee, Mark Warner of Virginia and Marco Rubio of Florida, warned in a statement last week. While Warner and Rubio praised President Joe Biden's CIA director, Bill Burns, for his ""renewed focus on these attacks,"" other lawmakers have become publicly exasperated with the executive branch's response. During a Senate hearing last week, Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., criticized the U.S. intelligence community's ""clamp down on information that's available to Congress, that's available to the public."" That, in turn, has led to a growing number of reports of alleged incidents without clarity about whether or not they're related to what's happened to U.S. personnel in Cuba, Shaheen said. ""It's not clear whether the information we're getting is correct or incorrect,"" she told Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines. ""The horse is out of the barn on this. The information is already out there, and I think it behooves us all to try to make sure that the information that gets out is accurate and that people understand what's happening."" Beyond Cuba, the State Department has previously acknowledged incidents in China, Uzbekistan and one redacted country in an internal report that was declassified and released in February. That unknown country is likely Russia, where a former CIA official said he was attacked. That official, Marc Polymeropoulos, told ABC News in March that he's now receiving treatment at Walter Reed Medical Center for a traumatic brain injury as well. But after reports of possible incidents in Syria, the head of U.S. Central Command said he had no evidence that was true. ""I have found no evidence of those attacks"" in CENTCOM's region, which includes Syria, Gen. Frank McKenzie, CENTCOM commander, told a Senate panel in April. During the same hearing, Gen. Stephen Townsend, head of U.S. Africa Command, added he's ""not seen that phenomenon in Africa"" either. One law enforcement source dismissed speculation about one incident in the Washington area, telling ABC News, ""There is no credible evidence to support this."" Biden's National Security Council is now conducting ""a full review of intelligence reporting to ascertain whether there may be previously unreported incidents that fit a broader pattern,"" a spokesperson confirmed to ABC News Friday. While the Trump administration initially said affected personnel had suffered ""health attacks,"" the spokesperson added that whether the incidents are an attack and whether they're the work of a foreign actor are still under ""active inquiry.""

2021-04-27,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/US/dc-police-department-reports-unauthorized-access-server/story?id=77339046,DC police department reports 'unauthorized access' on its server,"The U.S. capital's primary law enforcement agency has reported ""unauthorized access"" on its computer network. ""We are aware of unauthorized access on our server,"" the Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia said in a statement to ABC News on Monday. ""While we determine the full impact and continue to review activity, we have engaged the FBI to fully investigate this matter."" Javed Ali, a former national counterterrorism director at the National Security Council, said the apparent ransomware attack ""underscores the cyber vulnerabilities criminal groups and other malign actors continue to exploit."" ""Various sectors across state and local governments have been targeted, including law enforcement agencies, hospital systems and educational facilities due to shortcomings in cyber defenses and other information technology gaps,"" Ali told ABC News. ""Further, the lack of national-level standards on cybersecurity for key governmental functions at the state and local level complicates efforts to prevent these types of attacks or mitigate their effects."" The Metropolitan Police Department has over 4,000 sworn and civilian members serving Washington, D.C., making it one of the 10 largest local police agencies in the United States, according to its website. Although investigators have not attributed the server breach to Russian hackers, federal authorities issued a warning earlier this week about continued cyber attacks by Russia to exploit networks in the wake of the so-called SolarWinds hack. In December, it was discovered that at least nine federal agencies were breached by what the U.S. government believes are Russian actors through software from Texas-based company SolarWinds. In a statement posted on its website, SolarWinds said in December that it had provided two hotfix updates with security enhancements and that it would continue ""to work with leading security experts in our investigations to help further secure our products and internal systems."" The FBI, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency said in an assessment Monday that Russian hackers ""will continue to seek intelligence from U.S. and foreign entities through cyber exploitation, using a range of initial exploitation techniques that vary in sophistication, coupled with stealthy intrusion tradecraft within compromised networks."" The federal agencies said the Russians ""primarily target government networks, think tank and policy analysis organizations, and information technology companies."" According to the assessment, the Russians used tradecraft similar to SolarWinds and utilized the software to get into other networks and target individual emails at specific companies. The federal agencies urged companies to use multi-factor authentication and deploy monitoring techniques for internal networks. ""The FBI suspects the actors monitored IT staff to collect useful information about the victim networks, determine if victims had detected the intrusions, and evade eviction actions,"" the agencies said. The FBI did not immediately respond to ABC News' request for comment.",3,,,,6
2021-04-13,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/biden-proposes-summit-putin-amid-russian-military-buildup/story?id=77045132,Biden proposes summit with Putin amid Russian military buildup on Ukraine's border,"President Joe Biden spoke with Russian President Vladimir Putin Tuesday and proposed the two hold a summit in a third country ""in the coming months to discuss the full range of issues facing the United States and Russia,"" according to the White House. The call came days after Biden spoke to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky amid heightened concern about a massive buildup of Russian forces along Ukraine's border and in Crimea, the Ukrainian peninsula that has been occupied by Russia since 2014. Ukraine's foreign minister traveled to Brussels for meetings with Biden's Secretary of State Antony Blinken and senior NATO officials Tuesday in a strong signal of support for Kiev against any Russian aggression. During his call with Putin, the White House said, Biden urged him to ""de-escalate tensions"" with Ukraine - and warned the U.S. would ""act firmly"" to defend its own interests after Russia's repeated cyber attacks and election interference. Biden has emphasized a more nuanced approach to Russia than his predecessor, Donald Trump, who sought warmer relations with Putin and was criticized for downplaying Russian aggression, especially its interference in the 2016 presidential election to support him. ""President Biden reaffirmed his goal of building a stable and predictable relationship with Russia consistent with U.S. interests,"" the White House said Tuesday. U.S. officials have previously pointed to the agreement to extend New START, the last nuclear arms control pact between the U.S. and Russia, as an example of how the two countries can find common ground -- and Biden called for ""building on"" that during the call. The Kremlin confirmed interest in that, saying, ""Both sides expressed their readiness to continue the dialogue on the most important areas of ensuring global security... Biden expressed interest in normalizing the state of affairs on the bilateral track and establishing stable and predictable cooperation on such pressing issues,"" like Iran's nuclear program, Afghanistan, and climate change. But Russia's enormous military buildup on Ukraine's borders may make any cooperation anathema in Washington. Russia has massed 41,000 troops at its border with eastern Ukraine and 42,000 more in Crimea, according to a spokesperson for President Zelensky. Russian Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu confirmed Tuesday that the military has deployed two armies and three airborne formations to the region, but said they were participating in military exercises and in response to increased military activity by the U.S. and NATO. In addition to massing forces, Russian-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine have escalated fighting in recent weeks. With renewed shelling and machine-gun fire, 28 Ukrainian soldiers have been killed this year, according to the Ukrainian military -- a sharp increase in the long-running conflict that has killed more than 14,000 people. Beyond the battlefield, Russia has also launched ""a disinformation campaign blatantly designed to falsely blame Ukraine for what are the Kremlin's own actions,"" according to the top U.S. diplomat for Europe, Phil Reeker, who traveled with Blinken to NATO headquarters. The two met Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba Tuesday -- part of a strong signal of Western support for Kiev that included Kuleba meeting with NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg and the NATO-Ukraine Commission as well. While Ukraine isn't a member of the western alliance, it has repeatedly sought to join, with Zelensky saying against last week that it would that a path to membership ""is the only way to end the war in Donbass"" and send a ""real signal for Russia."" Stoltenberg didn't comment on Ukrainian membership, but during a press conference with Kuleba, he called Russia's military buildup ""unjustified, unexplained, and deeply concerning"" and said the alliance would continue to ""provide more practical support to Ukraine, to help them to defend themselves."" In their own meeting, Blinken reiterated that the U.S. ""stands firmly behind the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine,"" while Kuleba called their meeting a ""good symbol"" that helps ""make it very clear for Russia that the price of its aggression against Ukraine will be too heavy for it to bear."" But it's unclear what that price will be. Blinken has warned of ""consequences"" if Russia sends troops or arms into Ukraine, but not provided any details. A senior State Department official said it could include arms sales or sanctions, saying the U.S. has ""to continuously look at what their needs are."" The White House said Biden raised the buildup, but didn't warn of any response: ""The President voiced our concerns over the sudden Russian military build-up in occupied Crimea and on Ukraine's borders, and called on Russia to de-escalate tensions,"" it said in its readout. Instead, Biden's call seemed more focused on U.S.-Russian relations. Early in his administration, the new president ordered the intelligence community to launch a review of Russia's reported role in the SolarWinds hack, the bounties on U.S. troops in Afghanistan, 2020 election interference, and the poisoning of opposition leader Alexei Navalny. While that review remains ongoing, the U.S. joined other allies in sanctioning several Russian officials for Navalny's poisoning and jailing. The White House has said a U.S. response to the SolarWinds hack, which U.S. officials said Russia was responsible for, is coming soon.

2021-03-30,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/solarwinds-cyberhack-gained-access-acting-dhs-chiefs-emails/story?id=76766289,SolarWinds cyberhack gained access to then-acting DHS chief's emails: Sources,"Authorities believe that the massive ""SolarWinds"" hack allegedly carried out by Russia last year successfully breached the email accounts of then-DHS acting secretary Chad Wolf and dozens of other officials at the Department of Homeland Security, three sources familiar with the matter told ABC News. In fact, the email accounts of top officials at Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency -- the very DHS agency charged with fighting cyber threats -- may have been compromised by the cyberattack, according to one former government official familiar with the matter. In a statement, DHS acknowledges a ""small number"" of employees accounts were targeted in the breach, but there are no indicators that their networks are compromised as of now. ""A widespread intrusion campaign targeted many federal government and private sector entities, including DHS,"" according to a DHS spokesperson. ""Upon learning about the campaign, the Department took immediate steps to respond to the incident, including leveraging response teams from CISA and private sector partners, to continue executing its mission,"" the spokesperson said. ""However, this widespread intrusion campaign has again shown that our strategic adversaries are sophisticated, persistent, and have increasing capabilities.” The massive hack, discovered in December, affected nine federal agencies, according to Deputy National Security Adviser for cyber Anne Neuberger. Those responsible were ""likely of Russian origin,"" that the hack was ""launched from inside the United States” and that it could take ""several months"" to complete the investigation, she said at a press briefing in February. The administration has yet to outline what exactly their response will be to the hack. FBI Director Chris Wray, asked earlier this month by Senate Judiciary Chairman Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., what the U.S. government's response should be to the SolarWinds hack, said he didn't want to answer specifically because ""discussing the response in any detail is probably something that would be better done in a classified setting. That by itself might give you a little bit of a hint."" Wray said more generally that coming back from the SolarWinds hack would be a ""long, hard slog,"" even using the strategy that has been most effective for the U.S. in the past regarding countering cyber adversaries.

2021-02-05,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/International/young-men-kidnapped-russia-chechen-security-forces-lgbt/story?id=75707131,2 young men kidnapped in Russia by Chechen security forces: LGBT activists,"A Russian LGBT rights group says two young men it helped escape Chechnya have been kidnapped from a safe house in central Russia by Chechen security forces and returned to the region against their will, where they could face torture. The Russian LGBT Network, a Saint Petersburg-based charity with branches throughout Russia, according to their website, has helped hundreds of people in recent years leave Chechnya, a mountainous region in southern Russia, where security forces routinely imprison and torture people they suspect of being homosexual. The charity had helped Salekh Magamadov, 20, and Ismail Isteyev, 17, leave Chechnya last year after they were detained by police for two months and tortured, a representative for the network said. The two were resettled in an apartment in Nizhny Novgorod, about 250 miles from Moscow. But on Thursday one of the men made a panicked call to a worker at the charity calling for help, while in the background shouts from unknown people could be heard, David Isteyev, who took the call, told ABC News. The apartment was ransacked and the two men disappeared, Isteyev said. According to his information, the two men were seized by local police who then handed them over to Chechen security agents, who drove them to Chechnya. A lawyer for the two men has flown to Chechnya to find them. The lawyer, Alexander Nemov, who represents LGBT Network, told ABC News by phone that police had told him the two were being transported to the town of Gudermes, west of the capital Grozny. He said that police had confirmed that the two men had been detained as witnesses in relation to an old criminal case, but would not say what the case was. Neither man is a suspect in the case, he said. Nemov said he was concerned for the men's safety because they were taking an unusually long time to arrive in Gudermes and had still not arrived Friday night, long after local police said they would. ""At the present moment we aren't occupied with defending either Isayeva or Magamedova. We are trying to at least just find them,"" Nemov said. ""A significant amount of time has passed and that is very suspicious,"" he said. The lawyer said it was good that the police had at least confirmed they were the ones who had detained the two men. He asked why as witnesses they had been forcibly brought to Chechnya. ""They both are not suspects. They are witnesses. Why did they need to question them specifically in Chechnya? And for that bring them a thousand kilometers,"" Nemov said. The LGBT Network said a complaint about the men's detention was being filed to Russia's Investigative Committee that handles serious crimes. The alleged abduction highlights ongoing persecution of LGBT people in Chechnya under its strongman leader Ramzan Kadyrov. The routine kidnapping and brutal torture of gay men and women in the republic has been heavily documented by rights groups and journalists, since a so-called ""gay purge"" in 2017 made global headlines, when dozens of men were rounded up and tortured at police bases. Despite an international outcry, little has changed and the persecution has never stopped, with security forces continuing to regularly kidnap and abuse LGBT people, as well as those who criticize Kadyrov. An ABC News Nightline documentary in 2019 documented the cases of several gay men who were taken by police and tortured, beaten with rods and electrocuted. Chechen authorities have dismissed the allegations by telling media repeatedly that homosexuality doesn't exist in Chechnya or that people who are gay can't be Chechen. Despite the extensive documentation of the illegal detentions and torture, the federal Russian government has never condemned the persecution in Chechnya or ensured those responsible be brought to justice. Chechens living in exile in Europe have said they fear the reach of Kadyrov's security forces even there. Over the years there have been repeated reports of death squads targeting critics of Kadyrov and recently such activity seems to have intensified, with four assassinations or attempted killings against opponents in Europe in a year. Last July, Mamikhan Umarov, a former rebel commander, was shot dead in Vienna. Earlier that year, a well-known YouTube vlogger Tumso Abdurakhmanov fought off an attacker with a hammer who nearly killed him at his home in Sweden. The two men taken on Wednesday, Magamedov and Isayev, were seized by police in Chechnya last April, according to the LGBT Network. Magamadov had been a moderator in a social media group that mocked Kadyrov's government, Isteyev said. During their detention, police found material on the men's phones indicating their sexuality, Isteyev said. They were kept in detention for two months, beaten and humiliated, according to Isteyev, who said they were released after they made video statements posted online where they appeared under duress. After their release they were put under the control of police and ordered to remain in contact with them, Isteyev said. Following more threats, the LGBT Network helped the men leave. The United States and European countries have condemned the persecution of LGBT people in Chechnya. The U.S. Treasury Department in December announced additional sanctions against Kadyrov himself and six others, as well as a foundation and a mixed-martial arts club linked to him.",13,,,,24
2021-01-27,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/US/intel-report-warns-officials-cyberattack-targets-amid-remote/story?id=75498750,Intel report warns officials are 'very likely' to be cyberattack targets amid remote transition,"Working remotely amid a pandemic has been complicated for the average person, but for officials involved in the transition from the administrations of Donald Trump to Joe Biden, it poses a serious national security risk, according to an internal federal intelligence analysis obtained by ABC News. The report, issued by the Department of Homeland Security's Cyber Mission and Counterintelligence Mission centers in mid-January, warns that based on previous cyberattacks targeting political campaigns between 2018-2020, foreign cyber actors -- specifically American adversaries like Russia -- are ""very likely"" to target transition officials' ""government transition e-mail accounts and associated personal e-mail accounts."" Among the concerns detailed in the report is the risk that nation-state hackers sanctioned by foreign governments will likely look to take advantage of transition officials ""conducting a significant portion of the transition remotely rather than in face-to-face interactions as a result of COVID-19 restrictions."" The remote environment, the reports says, makes officials more ""attractive cyber targets for collection and possibly influence operations"" during the sensitive transition period. While there’s a heightened risk of cyberattacks when working remotely, this report focused on the transition period and details several tactics attackers could employ to compromise transition officials' virtual private networks and other remote work tools in order to ""gain initial access or persistence on a victim's network,"" including targeting official or personal e-mail accounts, posing as trusted associates, and ""spoofing domains to increase the appearance that the e-mails are legitimate."" ""Beyond serving traditional espionage purposes, these cyber activities could be used by foreign adversaries to enable influence operations, such as the leaking of sensitive or personal information designed to embarrass individuals and organizations -- or affect others' perceptions of those targets -- based on our analysis of prior cyber operations against U.S. Government officials and associated individuals,"" the intelligence notice says. The White House and DHS did not respond to requests for comment. Elizabeth Neumann, a former assistant secretary of Homeland Security during the Trump administration, told ABC News that while espionage efforts during the transition period have become standard, including during the 2016-2017 transition period, ""Operating in a near-virtual environment due to the pandemic creates more vulnerabilities, upon which advanced persistent threat actors may be able to capitalize."" ""Basic cyber hygiene and end-user best practices will mitigate many of the attempts these actors undertake,"" Neumann said. The report also cited the massive SolarWinds hack, which targeted U.S. government agencies and private corporations and left 18,000 networks compromised. The document noted that the federal Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency ""has observed malicious actors using the compromise to access resources in hosted environments, such as email for data exfiltration."" Earlier in January, top national security agencies formally named Russia as the likely source of the SolarWinds hack, with former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo calling the hack ""a very significant effort"" and ""pretty clearly"" the work of Russians. Russia has denied responsibility for the hack, which has reportedly affected the Departments of State, Homeland Security, Commerce, and Energy, as well as the National Institutes of Health. The report also provides transition officials with a number of preventative measures to protect themselves from cyberattacks, including the installation of firewalls and antivirus software, and the use of two-factor authentication.",3,,,,11

""This work indicates that an Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) actor, likely Russian in origin, is responsible for most or all of the recently discovered, ongoing cyber compromises of both government and non-governmental networks,"" the FBI, Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Administration, and Office of Director of National Intelligence said in a joint statement. ""At this time, we believe this was, and continues to be, an intelligence gathering effort. We are taking all necessary steps to understand the full scope of this campaign and respond accordingly."" The intrusion involves software from SolarWinds, which makes IT management tools, that had been adulterated, or ""Trojanized,"" with a vulnerability that could be exploited by hackers to steal information, manipulate systems or plant trap doors and other exploits for future use. The statement said that under 10 government agencies have been impacted. ABC News has reported five that were breached: the State Department, Energy Department, Department of Homeland Security, Treasury Department and Commerce Department. ""We have so far identified fewer than ten U.S. government agencies that fall into this category, and are working to identify and notify the nongovernment entities who also may be impacted,"" the statement added. The agencies also say this is a ""serious compromise that will require a sustained and dedicated effort to remediate."" The statement contradicted what President Donald Trump tweeted about the cyberattack in December. He baselessly accused China and brought up the general election being compromised despite no evidence to support it. ""The Cyber Hack is far greater in the Fake News Media than in actuality. I have been fully briefed and everything is well under control. Russia, Russia, Russia is the priority chant when anything happens because Lamestream is, for mostly financial reasons, petrified of discussing the possibility that it may be China (it may!). There could also have been a hit on our ridiculous voting machines during the election, which is now obvious that I won big, making it an even more corrupted embarrassment for the USA,"" he said. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and former Attorney General William Barr attributed the hack to Russia last month. ""It appears to be the Russians,"" Barr said at a press conference, adding that he couldn't comment any further. ABC News' Conor Finnegan contributed to this report.",3,,,,6

""All indications point to Russia,"" Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., the vice chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee told ABC Chief Anchor George Stephanopoulos on ""This Week,"" agreeing with recent claims by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and his Republican Intelligence Committee counterpart, Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla. Warner went on to state that Russia ""came away with a big, big haul,"" but that the government is still analyzing the extent of the attack, saying it will take ""literally weeks to continue to ferret this out and then potentially months to remediate."" Last week, it was revealed that several U.S. government departments, including Homeland Security, State and Treasury, among others, were the victims of a monthslong cyberattack that began with a breach of software contractor SolarWinds. The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency described the intrusion as a ""grave risk to the Federal Government … as well as critical infrastructure entities and other private sector organizations."" Despite that characterization and expressions of concern from members of Congress, including many Republicans, Trump downplayed the breach in a tweet Saturday, claiming the media is exaggerating the impact and that ""everything is well under control."" The president additionally cast doubt upon Russia's responsibility for the hack one day after Pompeo stated otherwise, writing that the media is ""petrified of discussing the possibility that it may be China (it may!)."" The secretary told conservative radio host Mark Levin Friday that ""we can say pretty clearly that it was the Russians that engaged in this activity."" ""When the president of the United States either tries to deflect, or is not willing to call out the adversary as we make this attribution, he is not making our country safer,"" Warner said Sunday. On ""This Week,"" the senator allowed for the possibility that, despite the discovery of the breach, ""it may be ongoing."" He added that SolarWinds' extensive list of customers across the government allowed for the attackers to work down its ""supply chain"" and ""ultimately get down to some of our most important innovation tools,"" describing the implications as ""extraordinarily serious."" For now, Warner said ""there's no indication yet [that] classified networks have been breached,"" but noted that ""critical information"" and potentially intellectual property related to cyber defense systems had been stolen from FireEye, the cybersecurity firm that first called attention to the intrusion. To that point, Stephanopoulos challenged Warner on the U.S.' own international cyber activities, noting that the country engages in similar efforts. ""How do you respond to those who say this is exactly the kind of thing America does all the time?"" Stephanopoulos asked. ""We attack and we conduct espionage on foreign governments and foreign systems."" The senator characterized Russia's alleged actions as ""indiscriminate"" in his answer, appearing to indicate that the hack was more extensive than the U.S.' activities. ""This is as broad and as deep as anything we've ever seen,"" Warner said, adding, ""the idea that that should go unanswered would be very bad American policy"" and could ""invite Russians, or others to continue these kinds of malicious activities."" As for the federal government's next steps, Warner argued that it needs to evaluate its cyber regulations and potentially implement rules that require private companies to report attacks and intrusions. He further likened the country's digital defense to the military, suggesting priorities shift in the modern age. ""I sometimes think we disproportionately spend on tanks, ships and guns, when we should be better protecting on cyber,"" the senator said.",3,,,,6
2020-12-19,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/pretty-clear-russia-solarwinds-hack-pompeo-1st-us/story?id=74818788,"'Pretty clear' Russia behind SolarWinds hack, Pompeo says, becoming 1st US official to blame Moscow","Donald Trump ran for the presidency promising to repair relations with Russia, saying repeatedly on the campaign trail in 2016 that it would be ""great"" if the U.S. and Russia ""got along."" But as his administration winds down, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is publicly blaming Moscow for a massive cyberattack that has affected several government agencies, including the most sensitive ones that oversee the nuclear weapons stockpile and COVID-19 vaccine research. Less than 24 hours later, Trump contradicted that with his first comments on the SolarWinds hack, tweeting that it was exaggerated by the media and that China could be responsible. It fits a familiar pattern of the last four years -- senior Trump officials trying to be tough on Moscow, while Trump downplays the threat. Amid the ongoing hack, Pompeo is also closing the last two U.S. consulates in Russia, citing the caps on American personnel that Moscow has forced on the U.S. mission in recent years. Once welcomed by Trump, those caps, which have hamstrung U.S. diplomats, were Russian retaliation against U.S. sanctions for its aggression online, in neighboring Ukraine, and with chemical weapons. ""This was a very significant effort, and I think it's the case that now we can say pretty clearly that it was the Russians that engaged in this activity,"" Pompeo told conservative radio host Mark Levin late Friday, hours before Trump's tweet. But Pompeo also indicated that the administration is not planning to take any action against Vladimir Putin's government, at least not publicly: ""There are many things that you'd very much love to say, 'Boy, I'm going to call that out,' but a wiser course of action to protect the American people is to calmly go about your business and defend freedom."" The SolarWinds hack is a ""significant and ongoing cybersecurity campaign,"" according to the FBI, the Department of Homeland Security and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. The intrusion involves software from SolarWinds, which makes IT management tools, that had been ""Trojanized"" with a vulnerability that could be exploited by hackers to steal information, manipulate systems or plant trap doors and other exploits for future use. Russia has denied responsibility for the hack. So far, the Departments of State, Homeland Security, Commerce, and Energy, as well as the National Institutes of Health all have reportedly been affected. ""The magnitude of this ongoing attack is hard to overstate,"" Trump's former homeland security adviser Thomas Bossert wrote this week. ""If it is Russia, President Trump must make it clear to Vladimir Putin that these actions are unacceptable. The U.S. military and intelligence community must be placed on increased alert; all elements of national power must be placed on the table."" After days of silence, Trump claimed on Saturday that the media is exaggerating the security breach's impact. He said he has ""been fully briefed and everything is well under control."" He went on to tweet that China may be behind the attack instead of Russia and claimed that there ""could also have been a hit on our ridiculous voting machines during the election."" While no public response seems to be coming soon, the U.S. is being forced to take another step that will cut into relations with Russia -- closing its last two consulates in the country. A State Department spokesperson confirmed to ABC News Friday that Pompeo, in consultation with U.S. ambassador to Russia, John Sullivan, decided to permanently close the U.S. consulate in Vladivostok and temporarily close the one in Yekaterinburg. This leaves just the U.S. embassy in Moscow as the only U.S. mission in the country. Russia forced the U.S. to close its consulate in St. Petersburg in 2018 in retaliation for the U.S. shuttering its facility in Seattle because of the poisoning of former spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in the United Kingdom. The U.S. facility in Vladivostok, Russia's major Pacific port near the border with North Korea, had been closed since March because of COVID-19 when most of its staff evacuated. The consulate in Yekaterinburg, Russia's fourth-largest city, was the only U.S. mission for the center of Russia. The spokesperson said in a statement that the decision was ""part of our ongoing efforts to ensure the safe and secure operation of the U.S. diplomatic mission in the Russian Federation"" and ""was taken to optimize the work of the U.S. mission."" But in a private notice to Congress, sent last week and first obtained by The Associated Press Friday evening, the department said it was a ""response to the ongoing staffing challenges of the U.S. Mission in Russia in the wake of the 2017-imposed personnel cap on the U.S. Mission and resultant impasse with Russia over diplomatic visas."" Russia imposed caps on the U.S. presence in 2017 in retaliation to sanctions placed by the Obama administration over the 2016 election interference --- a move that has hamstrung U.S. diplomats, but which President Trump said he was ""very thankful"" for though the White House later said he was being ""sarcastic."" That low point in U.S.-Russian relations is rivaled by the current one, with Russia believed to be responsible for the massive SolarWinds hack, which has also affected the private sector. Pompeo is the first U.S. official to go on the record and blame the Russian government, after U.S. officials told ABC News and other outlets that Moscow was likely responsible. ""We're still unpacking precisely what it is, and I'm sure some of it will remain classified. But suffice it to say there was a significant effort to use a piece of third-party software to essentially embed code inside of U.S. government systems and it now appears systems of private companies and companies and governments across the world as well,"" Pompeo also told Levin. But the U.S. doesn't expect to take action against Russia's remaining diplomatic facilities here, the State Department spokesperson said. Russia still has consulates in Houston and New York, as well as its Washington embassy. ABC News' Elizabeth Thomas, Luke Barr and Jack Date contributed to this report.",3,,,,5

President-elect Joe Biden issued a statement Thursday calling it a ""matter of great concern."" “I have instructed my team to learn as much as we can about this breach, and Vice President-elect Harris and I are grateful to the career public servants who have briefed our team on their findings, and who are working around-the-clock to respond to this attack,” Biden said. “We will elevate cybersecurity as an imperative across the government, further strengthen partnerships with the private sector, and expand our investment in the infrastructure and people we need to defend against malicious cyberattacks. But a good defense isn’t enough; we need to disrupt and deter our adversaries from undertaking significant cyber attacks in the first place,” Biden said, noting his team would implement stronger punitive measures for those who carry out any such attacks on the U.S. “Our adversaries should know that, as President, I will not stand idly by in the face of cyber assaults on our nation,” Biden said. The intrusion involves software from SolarWinds, which makes IT management tools, that had been adulterated or “Trojanized” with a vulnerability that could be exploited by hackers to steal information, manipulate systems or plant trap doors and other exploits for future use. The FBI, Department of Homeland Security and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence called the intrusion a ""significant and ongoing cybersecurity campaign."" ""The FBI is investigating and gathering intelligence in order to attribute, pursue, and disrupt the responsible threat actors,"" the agency's statement said. “The FBI is engaging with known and suspected victims, and information gained through FBI’s efforts will provide indicators to network defenders and intelligence to our government partners to enable further action.” The three agencies established a Cyber Unified Coordination Group on Tuesday and will work ""to coordinate a whole-of-government response to this significant cyber incident."" The statement reiterated that the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), under the Department of Homeland Security, is the lead agency in helping secure companies and agencies affected. Two government officials told ABC News that Russia is believed to be behind the attack that has so far compromised the Department of Homeland Security, State Department, National Institute of Health, Commerce and Treasury Departments. National Security Adviser Robert O’Brien cut an international trip short in order to return to the United States to address the cyberbreach of U.S. government computer networks, according to the White House’s National Security Council. A person familiar with the matter confirmed that there has been at least one NSC meeting to discuss the situation. The Russians have denied they are behind the attack, and while Trump hasn't commented, White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany asked on Tuesday about the breaches said the U.S. government was “taking all necessary steps to identify and remedy any possible issues related to the situation.” One lawmaker briefed on the intrusion said what they saw was troubling. ""Stunning,"" Sen. Richard Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat, tweeted on Tuesday. ""Today’s classified briefing on Russia’s cyberattack left me deeply alarmed, in fact downright scared. Americans deserve to know what's going on. Declassify what’s known & unknown."" Others, like former Trump administration Homeland Security Adviser Tom Bossert said ""the magnitude of the attack cannot be overstated."" ""The logical conclusion is that we must act as if the Russian government has control of all the networks it has penetrated. But it is unclear what the Russians intend to do next,"" Bossert wrote in New York Times op-ed. ""The access the Russians now enjoy could be used for far more than simply spying."" Bossert also asserts that trying to pick up the pieces after this intrusion could be very difficult. ""The remediation effort alone will be staggering. It will require the segregated replacement of entire enclaves of computers, network hardware and servers across vast federal and corporate networks,"" Bossert said. ""Somehow, the nation’s sensitive networks have to remain operational despite unknown levels of Russian access and control. A “do over” is mandatory and entire new networks need to be built — and isolated from compromised networks. Cyber threat hunters that are stealthier than the Russians must be unleashed on these networks to look for the hidden, persistent access controls. These information security professionals actively search for, isolate and remove advanced, malicious code that evades automated safeguards. This will be difficult work as the Russians will be watching every move on the inside,"" he warned. Cyberexperts concur with Bossert’s assertion that this hack could potentially be incredibly damaging. “The potential for damage here is full compromise of the environment, including theft of sensitive materials,” Tony Turner, Vice President for Security Solutions for Fortress Security Solutions, told ABC News. On Monday, SolarWinds said as many as 18,000 organizations including unclassified federal government networks and 425 Fortune 500 companies could have downloaded the malicious software, according to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing. ""We believe that this vulnerability is the result of a highly-sophisticated, targeted and manual supply chain attack by a nation state. We are acting in close coordination with FireEye, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the intelligence community, and other law enforcement to investigate these matters,"" SolarWinds President and CEO Kevin Thompson said on Sunday. Over the weekend, CISA, assessed there is “high potential for compromises of agency information systems,” and the potential “grave impact of a successful compromise,” in affected systems and for only the fifth time in the agency’s history issued an emergency directive “to review their networks for indicators of compromise and disconnect or power down SolarWinds Orion products immediately.” CISA is operating with an acting director after President Trump fired director Chris Krebs in November. ""The compromise of SolarWinds’ Orion Network Management Products poses unacceptable risks to the security of federal networks,"" said CISA acting Director Brandon Wales. Javed Ali, a former senior counterterrorism director on the National Security Council and former FBI official said that Russia has not been deterred by the United States previous response to Russians meddling in US systems. ""It raises serious questions about the level of US defensive measures against cyber-attacks, as the vulnerabilities exploited in this latest attack crossed over into both private industry cyber tools and federal ones--neither of which were able to identify the Russian breaches until months after they began,"" he explained.

2020-12-14,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/us-treasury-commerce-departments-breached-agency/story?id=74706054,"US Treasury, Commerce Department breached, agency says","The U.S. Treasury Department and U.S. Department of Commerce were victims of a cyber breach, the agency and a source familiar with the breach confirmed to ABC News. “We can confirm there has been a breach in one of our bureaus. We have asked CISA and the FBI to investigate, and we cannot comment further at this time,” the Commerce Department said in a statement Sunday. A source familiar with the investigation tells ABC News it was a sophisticated attack and that very few entities are capable of such. Authorities are investigating and assessing who was behind the breach, which may reach beyond the Treasury and Commerce departments, but two government officials tell ABC News that Russia is believed to be behind the cyber intrusion. “The United States government is aware of these reports and we are taking all necessary steps to identify and remedy any possible issues related to this situation,” NSC spokesman John Ullyot told ABC News. The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, an arm of the Department of Homeland Security, told ABC News it is assisting with the investigation. “We have been working closely with our agency partners regarding recently discovered activity on government networks. CISA is providing technical assistance to affected entities as they work to identify and mitigate any potential compromises.” CISA offered an emergency directive Sunday night to “mitigate the compromise” of the software that is used by the Treasury and Commerce Departments and was compromised. SolarWinds, the company which provided the software for these agencies, says it's working with the FBI and law enforcement to get to the bottom of the breach. ""We are aware of a potential vulnerability which, if present, is currently believed to be related to updates which were released between March and June 2020 to our Orion monitoring products,"" SolarWinds President and CEO Kevin Thompson said in a statement. ""We believe that this vulnerability is the result of a highly-sophisticated, targeted and manual supply chain attack by a nation state."" Under the Homeland Security Act, CISA can authorize emergency guidance to federal departments using the software to disconnect the software from their server. “The compromise of SolarWinds’ Orion Network Management Products poses unacceptable risks to the security of federal networks,” CISA Acting Director Brandon Wales said in a statement Sunday. “Tonight’s directive is intended to mitigate potential compromises within federal civilian networks, and we urge all our partners—in the public and private sectors—to assess their exposure to this compromise and to secure their networks against any exploitation.”",3,,,,6
2020-12-14,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/International/russian-intelligence-hit-squad-poisoned-opposition-leader-alexey/story?id=74716459,Russian intelligence hit squad poisoned opposition leader Alexey Navalny: Report,"The independent investigative group Bellingcat says it has identified a team of Russian intelligence agents that it says were behind the poisoning of the opposition leader Alexey Navalny with a nerve agent this summer. In a detailed investigation published on Monday, Bellingcat said it was able to use phone and flight records to show that a squad of officers from Russia's domestic intelligence agency, the Federal Security Service (FSB), had trailed Navalny for years and were in his vicinity in the Siberian city of Tomsk shortly before he fell sick. Navalny, Russia’s most prominent opposition leader, fell critically ill on a passenger flight from Tomsk in August and was later evacuated to Germany for treatment. A German government lab determined he had been poisoned with a Novichok nerve agent, a type of chemical weapon developed by the Soviet Union and the same kind used to poison the former Russian double agent Sergey Skripal in Britain in 2018. Russia has denied any involvement in the assassination attempt on Navalny and sought to blame it on the activist himself or Germany. But Bellingcat said its new investigation showed the squad of FSB officers had followed Navalny since at least 2017 as he traveled around Russia for his activism, beginning shortly after he launched a thwarted campaign for president. At least three members of the same squad followed Navalny to Tomsk at the time of his poisoning and were in contact with an FSB chemical weapons specialist around that time, Bellingcat said. Bellingcat is well-known for its open-source investigations and has previously published evidence showing Russian involvement in major incidents, including the Skripal poisoning and the shooting down of MH17. The group's researchers said it had used phone data, leaked passport information and flight records to track the movement of the FSB team, which overlapped heavily with those of Navalny. According to Bellingcat, the FSB officers took 37 trips to the same destinations at the same time as Navalny between 2017 and 2020. Of all the trips undertaken by the FSB officers together, only one did not overlap with a trip taken by Navalny, Bellingcat said. Bellingcat said it had identified at least eight FSB operatives who it believes were involved directly in Navalny’s poisoning in Tomsk and posted the men’s photographs. All of them belong to a unit within an FSB body called the Criminalistics Institute or Scientific-Research Institute No.2 or NII-2, Bellingcat said. The Criminalistics Institute is formally tasked with forensic work for the FSB but, according to KGB defectors, is also home to a secretive poison lab. Bellingcat said that mobile phone tower data showed the men frequently visiting and making calls from the institute’s offices in Moscow. Phone records showed that the same officers who had followed Navalny were in regular contact with a military scientist who previously worked on Russia’s chemical weapons program, Bellingcat said. The researchers said the scientist was Col. Alexander Makshakov, who now runs the FSB’s clandestine poisoning program. Some of the men, including Makshakov, were also in contact with senior FSB commanders, including Vladimir Bogdanov, who is currently head of the FSB’s Special Technology Center. When Navalny traveled to Siberia in August to meet with volunteers from his activist group, three of the same FSB officers traveled with him, according to Bellingcat. It named them as Alexey Alexandrov and Ivan Osipov, both trained medical doctors, and Vladimir Panyaev. Based on phone data, the men then followed Navalny to Tomsk, the report said. Bellingcat said phone records showed members of the team communicating throughout the period and that there was a “sudden peak” in communication among the FSB officers just before the poisoning and that some of the officers in Tomsk were exchanging messages with Makshakov, the chemical weapons specialist, while they were there. Bellingcat said it strongly suggests the “poisoning attempt on Navalny’s life was mandated at the highest echelons of the Kremlin.” The Bellingcat report does not answer how Navalny was poisoned. The report notes that on night before he fell sick a barman at his hotel had persuaded him to drink a Negroni cocktail. “Navalny accepted the suggestion, but told us he couldn’t take more than one sip as “the cocktail tasted like the most disgusting thing I’ve had in my life,"" the Bellingcat report said. The report draws no conclusions on whether Navalny could have been poisoned with the cocktail. A German lab found trace amounts of Novichok on a hotel water bottle drank by Navalny, but said the amounts were likely left there by Navalny’s lips after he had already been poisoned. The Bellingcat report also suggests that Navalny and his wife might have been targeted by another botched poisoning attempt less than two months before. Navalny said his wife Yulia became mysteriously unwell while the two were in the Russian city Kaliningrad for a romantic break in early July. She experienced symptoms similar to what he felt on the plane after he was poisoned. Bellingcat said two members of the same FSB team who were in Tomsk had booked flights to Kaliningrad on the same day as the Navalnys. Just before their flights, the officers made multiple phone calls to Makshakov, according to Bellingcat. Navalny on Monday said the investigation laid bare the plot to kill him. “I know who wanted to kill me. I know where they work. I know their real names,” Navalny said in a video posted on YouTube. Navalny is currently undergoing rehabilitation in Germany after recovering from the attack which left him in a three-week coma. Navalny, who made his name with explosive investigations detailing alleged corruption among members of Putin’s circle, is Russia’s best-known opposition leader. He has been repeatedly jailed for his activism over the years and suffered frequent harassment, including sometimes physical attacks. Top Russian officials have denied any involvement in Navalny’s poisoning and instead have floated a series of contradictory explanations, including that he suffered from diabetes or that Germany poisoned him. Putin reportedly told France’s Emmanuel Macron that Navalny could have poisoned himself. The European Union imposed sanctions on senior Russian officials over the poisoning, including members of Putin’s presidential office.",3,,,,14
2020-11-16,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/US/astronauts-set-launch-iss-historic-nasa-spacex-mission/story?id=74134522,4 astronauts launch for ISS in historic NASA-SpaceX mission,"Four astronauts launched into orbit on Sunday in the historic first operational flight for SpaceX's Crew Dragon spacecraft as part of NASA's commercial crew mission. This marks the second-ever crewed mission for Elon Musk's private space-faring firm SpaceX, after the successful launch and return of NASA astronauts Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley with the Demo-2 mission this summer. It is also the culmination of years of collaboration between NASA and the private sector as part of an effort to bring launch capabilities back to U.S. soil and end a dependency on Russia for trips to the International Space Station. ""This is another historic moment -- it seems like every time I come to Kennedy [Space Center] we're making history, and this is no different,"" NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine said in a pre-launch news conference on Friday. ""The history being made this time is we're launching what we call an operational flight to the International Space Station."" ""The whole goal here is to commercialize our activities in low-Earth orbit,"" he added. ""NASA wants to be one customer of many customers in a very robust commercial marketplace for human spaceflight in low-Earth orbit."" The ship launched on Sunday from pad 39A at NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida, after being pushed back -- first to assess an engine issue with the Falcon 9 rocket and then once more due to weather. President-elect Joe Biden tweeted out his congratulations to the team on their successful launch. ""It's a testament to the power of science and what we can accomplish by harnessing our innovation, ingenuity, and determination. I join all Americans and the people of Japan in wishing the astronauts Godspeed on their journey,"" he tweeted. A short time later, President Donald Trump tweeted ""A great launch!"" before claiming that NASA ""was a closed up disaster when we took over."" ""Now it is again the ""hottest"", most advanced, space center in the world, by far!"" he tweeted. The crew for the historic launch includes a Space Force colonel, a Black pilot leaving Earth for the first time, a woman who has logged nearly 4,000 hours in space and a Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency astronaut. NASA astronauts Michael Hopkins, Victor Glover and Shannon Walker, as well as JAXA astronaut Soichi Noguchi, are set to stay on the ISS for six months after the launch and help with maintenance and research. Hopkins, commander of the mission, has spent 166 days in space and completed multiple space walks. The Missouri native worked as a flight test engineer with the Air Force before joining NASA. This is the first spaceflight for Glover, the pilot and second-in-command. A native of California, Glover was selected as an astronaut in 2013 and is a former Naval aviator. Walker is the team's mission specialist. She is an ISS veteran, having spent 161 days aboard the orbiting laboratory in 2010 conducting numerous experiments. Noguchi, also a mission specialist, is the first international NASA-SpaceX crew member. Noguchi has been on two spaceflights and made history as the first Japanese astronaut to perform a spacewalk outside the ISS in 2005. Late last month, the crew said they were naming their spacecraft ""Resilience"" -- a nod to the ability to overcome the myriad challenges thrown at them during this tumultuous year. ""As you look at the definition of resilience, I know it means functioning well in times of stress or overcoming adverse events, and I think all of us can agree that 2020 certainly has been a challenging year,"" Hopkins said at a news conference. ""So the name 'Resilience' is really in honor of the SpaceX and NASA teams, and, quite frankly, it's in honor of our families, of our colleagues, of our fellow citizens, of our international partners and our leaders that have all shown that same quality, that same characteristic, through these difficult times,"" he added.

2020-10-19,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/doj-announces-charges-russian-gru-officers-allegedly-involved/story?id=73698190,"DOJ announces charges against 6 Russian military officers allegedly involved in hacking, malware operations","The Justice Department Monday announced an indictment against six Russia GRU officers charged with engaging in a series of hacking and malware deployment operations to attack other countries' infrastructure, elections and other actions designed to further Russia's interests. The indictment specifically accuses the six alleged hackers of engaging in computer intrusions ""intended to support Russian government efforts to undermine, retaliate against or otherwise destabilize"" Ukraine, Georgia, elections in France, the 2018 PyeongChang Olympic Games and international efforts to hold Russia accountable for its use of the nerve agent Novichok on foreign soil. According to the Justice Department, several members of the same military group were previously charged for their role in Russia's efforts to interfere in the 2016 election, though the allegations in Monday's indictment do not relate to U.S. election interference. U.S. officials at virtual press conference at DOJ described the hacking campaign as among ""the most destructive and costly cyber-attacks in history,"" dealing with ""some of the world's most destructive malware to date."" Assistant Attorney General for National Security John Demers argued the allegations prove why the U.S. should ignore a recent offer extended by Russia calling for a cyber ""reset"" between the two countries. ""This indictment lays bare Russia’s use of its cyber capabilities to destabilize and interfere with the domestic political and economic systems of other countries, thus providing a cold reminder of why its proposal is nothing more than dishonest rhetoric and cynical and cheap propaganda,"" Demers said. Some of the malware deployed by the officers, according to prosecutors, included Killdisk, Industroyer and NotPetya, believed to be the most costly and destructive cyber attack in history which led to nearly $1 billion in losses for three victims named in the indictment -- including the Heritage Valley health system in Pennsylvania. ""The attack caused the unavailability of patient lists, patient history, physical examination files, and laboratory records,"" the DOJ said in a press release. ""Heritage Valley lost access to its mission-critical computer systems (such as those relating to cardiology, nuclear medicine, radiology, and surgery) for approximately one week and administrative computer systems for almost one month, thereby causing a threat to public health and safety."" The group also is alleged to have engaged in a spearphishing campaign targeting the 2018 Winter Olympic Games, launching what officials described as the ""Olympic Destroyer"" malware attack during the opening ceremony that deleted data from thousands of computers supporting the games. ""The conspirators, feeling the embarrassment of international penalties related to Russia’s state-sponsored doping program, i.e., cheating, took it upon themselves to undermine the games,"" Demers said. ""Their cyber attack combined the emotional maturity of a petulant child with the resources of a nation state."" Later in the press conference, Demers was asked whether the U.S. has any evidence of intelligence that the GRU might seek to carry out similar operations targeting the upcoming election. “With respect to the elections that are coming up, you know we haven't seen anything that caused us to question what we've I think repeatedly said and what the intelligence community's repeatedly said -- that Americans should be confident that a vote for their candidate will be counted for that candidate,"" Demers answered.",3,,,,29
2020-09-30,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/International/russia-jails-historian-uncovered-stalin-mass-graves-13/story?id=73335925,Russia jails historian who uncovered Stalin mass graves for 13 years,"MOSCOW -- A Russian court has sentenced a historian who helped uncover Stalin-era mass graves to 13 years in prison, abruptly increasing his sentence by 10 years, in a highly unusual step that rights groups said was revenge for his work and part of a broader campaign to whitewash the dark chapters of Russia’s Soviet history. The case of Yury Dmitriyev attracted international criticism when he was sentenced to three and a half years in prison earlier this year on charges condemned by human rights organizations as fabricated. He had, however, been due to be released within weeks because of time-served in pre-trial detention. But on Tuesday, a higher court in the northern city of Petrozavodsk abruptly overturned the original ruling and sentenced Dmitriyev to 13 years in a prison colony. Dmitriyev, 64, is a member of Memorial, a group that commemorates the victims of Soviet repression. He has faced criminal prosecution since 2016 based on shifting charges based around allegations he had taken pornographic photos of his young adopted daughter and abused her. His supporters though say his imprisonment, in reality, is linked to his role in uncovering mass graves tied to the Soviet gulag prison system and say the charges are an attempt to smear a figure who has played a leading role in commemorating the mass murder conducted under Joseph Stalin. Memorial on Tuesday condemned the ruling saying it was clearly “politically motivated.” “Today’s sentence is the revenge of the system which is heir to the Soviet system and would like to consign to oblivion the names that Yury Dmitry has returned, having besmirched him himself, his work and his life,” it said in a statement. Human Rights Watch has previously called the charges against Dmitriyev “bogus.” The United States embassy in Moscow condemned the new sentence as “outrageous.” The embassy’s spokeswoman Rebecca Ross wrote on Twitter it “is another step backwards for #humanrights and historical truths in #Russia.” In the 1990s, Dmitriyev and others found a grave in his home region of Karelia in northern Russia in a place known as Sandarmokh close to the border with Finland. The site is believed to hold the bodies of at least 6,000 prisoners executed by Soviet secret police during what’s known as Stalin’s ‘Great Terror’ between 1937 and 1938. But in recent years though, a state-backed nationalist conservative group has sought to alter the narrative around the grave. The Military-Historical Society, whose membership includes many senior Russian government officials, has promoted a theory that the grave also holds Soviet soldiers killed by Finnish troops during World War II. The group has conducted digging at the grave and, in 2018, it exhumed 16 corpses that it said were Red Army soldiers in order to support the theory that not only the Soviets were killed at the site . Critics have said it is part of a broader effort to downplay Soviet crimes under president Vladimir Putin. Putin does not deny the mass repression under Stalin, but has sought to shift the emphasis onto the dictator’s role in modernizing Russia and defeating Nazi Germany. The case against Dmitriyev has shown repeated problems. He was acquitted on the charges of taking pornographic photos by a court in April 2018, but a higher court overturned the ruling and ordered further investigation. Police then brought the case once again and added a new charge alleging that Dmitriyev had violently sexually abused his daughter. In July this year, a court convicted Dmitriyev of that charge and gave him the three and a half year sentence. Rights groups a condemned that as a travesty of justice but also celebrated it as a victory because the shorter sentence meant that because of his lengthy time spent in pre-trial detention Dmitriyev would be freed in November. The court also acquitted him of the original pornography charge. His supporters at the time said the verdict essentially amounted to an “acquittal” and his lawyers appealed to have the guilty verdict fully overturned. Prosecutors, however, appealed the decision and the court on Tuesday satisfied their request to jail Dmitriyev for 13 years. It also overturned his acquittal on the pornography charge and sent it back for investigation. Dmitriyev’s trial was held entirely behind closed doors and, at the hearing on Tuesday, his lawyer was not present because he was quarantining due to a suspected coronavirus infection. The court rejected a request to delay until his lawyer could attend and overruled his objection to be represented by a court appointed lawyer. Memorial has faced frequent harassment in recent years, including a series of dubious criminal cases. The organization also campaigns against present day abuses and its offices have been raided and its members sometimes physically attacked.",13,,,,26
2020-09-18,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/us-sends-bradley-fighting-vehicles-syria-boost-security/story?id=73104548,US sends Bradley Fighting Vehicles to Syria to boost security for troops following Russian encounter,"In a show of force, the U.S. military has sent armored fighting vehicles to eastern Syria to help protect the hundreds of American troops stationed there following a tense encounter with Russian forces last month that left seven American troops injured, said U.S. Central Command. A military spokesman said the deployment of Bradley Fighting Vehicles, advanced radars and increased flight patrols was a ""clear demonstration of U.S. resolve to defend Coalition forces"" in eastern Syria. ""U.S. Central Command has directed a number of actions in northeast Syria to help ensure the safety and security of Coalition forces,"" Capt. Bill Urban, a spokesman for U.S. Central Command, said in a statement. ""The United States has deployed Sentinel radar, increased the frequency of U.S. fighter patrols over U.S. forces, and deployed Bradley Fighting Vehicles to augment U.S. forces in the Eastern Syria Security Area (ESSA),"" he added. ""These actions are a clear demonstration of U.S. resolve to defend Coalition forces in the ESSA, and to ensure that they are able to continue their Defeat-ISIS mission without interference,"" said Urban. ""The United States does not seek conflict with any other nation in Syria, but will defend Coalition forces if necessary,"" said Urban. A U.S. official said that six Bradley Fighting Vehicles arrived in Syria early Friday from Kuwait and that their deployment along with the forces manning the radar equipment will add an additional 100 personnel to the 500 American forces operating in eastern Syria. An additional 100 to 200 U.S. military personnel are stationed at a remote outpost along a major southern highway near the border with Jordan that is a transit point for Iranian weapons to Hezabollah and Syrian President Bashar Assad's regime. The deployment of the Bradleys is a direct result of the Aug. 26 incident where a Russian armored vehicle rammed an American military patrol vehicle injuring seven service members. ""These actions and reinforcements are a clear signal to adhere to mutual de-confliction processes and for Russia and other parties to avoid unprofessional and unsafe and provocative action in eastern Syria,"" said the U.S. official. That incident was deemed serious enough that Gen. Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, phoned his Russian counterpart to express concerns about Russian actions that some officials described as ""reckless."" The deployment is intended as a show of force to Russian troops that have been encroaching on the U.S. military's areas of operations east of the Euphrates River. Russian troops are supposed to operate west of that river, and American military officials have said that despite Russian claims their troops were not cleared to operate in the U.S. zone on the day of the incident. There are about 500 American troops in eastern Syria operating in eastern Syria as part of a mission to protect Kurdish oil fields from ISIS. Bradley Fighting Vehicles were first deployed to Syria last October as the first visible sign of the new American mission to protect the Kurdish oil fields. That mission followed President Donald Trump's initial decision to pull all 2,000 U.S. troops out of Syria following Turkey's invasion targeting Kurdish forces. But the deployment was brief as they were removed three weeks after they had arrived and were replaced by additional forces. The deployment came on the same day Trump said during a briefing that U.S. was ""out of Syria,"" before adding the caveat of just protecting ""the oil."" ""We are out of Syria, other than we kept the oil. I kept the oil, and we have troops guarding the oil. Other than that, we are out of Syria,"" Trump said. ""We're out of Syria, except we kept the oil and we will make a determination, we’ll probably be dealing with the Kurds on the oil, and see what it all ends up, but we’ll be out,"" he added. The U.S.-led anti-ISIS coalition said in a statement that the new deployment of Bradley Fighting Vehicles were all from the 2nd Brigade Combat Team, 1st Armored Division currently deployed to Kuwait.",14,,,,20
2020-09-03,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/International/novichok-nerve-agent-poison-russian-opposition-leader-alexey/story?id=72789465,"What is Novichok, the nerve agent used to poison Russian opposition leader Alexey Navalny?","Novichok is a series of nerve agent weapons developed as part of a secret Soviet program and continued once the Soviet Union collapsed. A Novichok nerve agent was used to poison the former Russian double agent Sergey Skripal in the English town of Salisbury in 2018, making the weapon a household name. So when Germany's government announced Wednesday the Russian opposition leader Alexey Navalny had been poisoned with a nerve agent from the ""Novichok group"" it was seen as an explosive development solidifying evidence that Navalny's poisoning was carried out by Russian security agencies. Russia's government has always denied the ""Novichok"" weapons' existence, despite its own state media running interviews with the scientists involved in their creation. Most of what is known about them comes from accounts from a handful of Russian scientists, in particular Zil Mirzayanov, who in the 1990s went public about them giving interviews to Russian and foreign journalists. ""Novichok"" translates as ""New boy"" from Russian and the name was given because the nerve agents were a new type known as ""binaries."" Unlike more common nerve agents such as VX and sarin, binaries consist of two substances that have to be combined in order to activate them, making it easier to transport them and also to conceal from weapons inspectors. The weapons were developed under a program known as ""Foliant,"" according to Mirzayanov. In the 1990s, he had been tasked with ensuring the secrecy of Russia's chemical weapons program, but he decided to go public because he believed the program violated the country's commitment to the Chemical Weapons Convention that it had signed along with the United States. Accounts from scientists involved in creating the Novichok nerve agents have described them as extraordinarily dangerous, a tiny amount of which is enough to cause serious long-term health problems and if not treated with an antidote, death. Andrei Zheleznyakov, a scientist working on a Novichok nerve agent described being accidentally exposed in a lab in 1987, in an interview from a Soviet newspaper found by The Guardian in 2018. In the interview with the newspaper Novoye Vremya, he said a malfunction with hood ventilation released a small amount of the nerve agent, known as ""Novichok-5"" into the air. Zheleznyakov, who was given an antidote, died within a year suffering from cirrhosis, toxic hepatitis, nerve damage and epilepsy. The nerve agents are made from organophosphates, the basis of which can be relatively common fertilizers. The agents harm victims in the same way as most nerve agents: by attacking the nervous system, causing a person to lose control of bodily functions, prompting cardiac arrest and shutting down the respiratory system. ""The ones that we know about are working very much the same way as other nerve agents such VX, sarin. So they affect the ability of the body to communicate with itself and slowly strangle it with a lack of oxygen and you end up with a cardiac arrest or a pulmonary arrest -- you go into a heart attack and you can't breathe anymore,"" Gwynn Winfield, a chemical weapons expert with the publication CBRNe World, told ABC News after the Skripal poisoning. In an academic article published in 1995 by the Stimson Center, Mirzayanov wrote that Novichok-5 was five to eight times more lethal than VX gas. The German government suggested that the nerve agent used to poison Navalny may be somewhat different than the one used against Skripal. Some experts have wondered why no one else around Navalny was sickened by the poison. In the Salisbury poisoning, not only Skripal's daughter Yulia but also a responding police officer and a local couple who found the container carrying the poison were hospitalised. One of the couple, Dawn Sturgess, died. In the case of the Skripals, British police said the nerve agent had been brought into the U.K. in a perfume bottle by two agents from Russia's military intelligence agency, the GRU, and had been sprayed on the door handle of Sergey Skripal's house in Salisbury. He and his daughter had likely then absorbed the poison through their skin. Mirzayanov though has said Novichok nerve agents can also take the form of powder and can be released through the air. The Skripals spent weeks in the hospital and remain under British government protection. Navalny has been in an induced coma for almost three weeks and is still connected to a ventilator in the intensive care unit, according to Berlin's the Charité hospital where he was evacuated from Russia at the demand of his family. Most chemical weapons experts have said only a handful of government labs in the world could produce a Novichok nerve agent and its use would strongly suggest Russia's state must have been involved in Navalny's poisoning. Germany's chancellor on Wednesday said Russia must provide an explanation of its position around the case and said depending on the Russian response Germany and its allies in NATO and the European Union would reply with an ""adequate response"". It raises ""very serious questions,"" German Chancellor Angela Merkel told reporters on Wednesday. ""Which only the Russian government can and must answer.""",3,,,,26
2020-08-26,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/International/navalny-long-history-russian-poisonings/story?id=72579648,"Before Navalny, a long history of Russian poisonings","The suspected poisoning of Russia's best-known opposition leader Alexey Navalny is the latest to happen to a long line of Kremlin opponents. The Kremlin, as it has with Navalny’s case, has denied any involvement but poison has long been a weapon used by the Russian security services and employed by the Soviet Union under president Vladimir Putin. In some cases evidence has emerged seeming to strongly link them to the Russian state, while others have remained mysterious. The Kremlin’s spokesman Dmitry Peskov on Monday told reporters he disagreed there was a “trend” of Kremlin opponents being poisoned. ""You’ll agree that in many country in the world, everyday a lot of poisonings happen,” Peskov said, saying it was necessary to look at every case individually. But the list of those who have troubled the Russian government or security services and then suffered poisoning is lengthy. Within its first years, the Soviet Union developed a secret poison lab within its security services. The lab, known among security agents as “kamera” -- meaning “the chamber” in Russian -- for decades specialized in developing poisons difficult to detect and, under Joseph Stalin, tested its products on gulag prisoners, according to Soviet defectors. Boris Voldarsky, a former officer from the Soviet military intelligence agency, the GRU, who has written a book on the KGB poison program has written there is one constant in the lab's products. “They must make the victim's death or illness appear natural or at least produce symptoms that will baffle doctors and forensic investigators. To this end the Kamera developed its defining specialty: combining known poisons into original and untraceable forms,"" Voldarsky wrote in an article for The Wall Street Journal in 2005. There were several famous poisoning episodes during the Cold War. Georgi Markov, a Bulgarian dissident died after a KGB agent pricked him with a ricin-tipped umbrella. In 1957, Nikolai Khokhlov, a KGB defector, came close to death after drinking a cup of coffee laced with an unknown type of thallium. Poisonings have occurred under Putin almost since the start of his rule. In 2004, Viktor Yushchenko, a candidate who ran against a Kremlin-favored incumbent for Ukraine's presidency was poisoned with dioxin, leaving him disfigured. The same year, the celebrated investigative journalist, Anna Politkovskaya fell suddenly ill and lost consciousness after drinking a cup of tea while flying to the Russian city of Beslan during the school siege there. She survived, but was shot dead two years later, on Putin’s birthday. The two poisonings that have most closely associated Putin with poisoning internationally occurred in the U.K. In 2006, Alexander Litvinenko, a former officer from Russia’s FSB security service turned critic, died after being exposed to polonium-210, a radioactive isotope, slipped into his tea at an upscale hotel. British police later sought to charge two Russians, Dmitry Kovtun and Andrey Lugovoy and a U.K. public inquiry concluded that Putin had likely personally ordered the assassination. Russia refused to extradite the two men and Lugovoy was instead made a member of parliament. In 2018, another former Russian intelligence officer Sergey Skripal, was nearly fatally poisoned with a nerve agent in the English town of Salisbury. The poison, which was identified by British investigators as a nerve agent, known as ""Novichok"", developed by the Soviet Union as part of a secret chemical weapons program. Russia again denied responsibility, but U.K. police were able to track two men, who were later identified as officers in Russian military intelligence. Both men, Anatoly Chepiga and Alexander Mishkin were found to have previously received Russia’s highest state honor, awarded personally by Putin. Experts have stressed that Navalny may not have been poisoned at the Kremlin’s order. Navalny, who has made his name with high-profile investigations of alleged corruption among powerful Russians, has many enemies. The choice of poison though usually means the involvement of Russia's security services, whether acting for the state or corruptly for others. “No matter whether it’s an attempted murder or just scare tactics, poisonings are pretty much always somehow connected to the security services,” Tatiana Stanovaya, a non-resident scholar at the Carnegie Moscow Center wrote last week, adding that she does not believe the Kremlin ordered the assassination attempt. She wrote she believes the attack on Navalny was likely carried out by powerful figures acting on their initiative, either indifferent to the Kremlin's reaction or believing it would please it. . Navalny's case for now has drawn the closest comparisons with two other suspected poisoning cases of opposition figures. Vladimir Kara-Murza, a pro-democracy activist from Open Russia, a group funded by Putin foe Mikhail Khodorkovsky, twice nearly died in 2015 and 2017 after his organs suddenly began failing. A French lab found high levels of heavy metals in his blood but was unable to identify the poison. Petr Verzilov, a member of the protest group, Pussy Riot, two years ago suddenly fell inexplicably and critically ill. He was evacuated to Germany for treatment, kept in an induced coma, and doctors there said he had been poisoned. Verzilov survived and last week helped arrange for Navalny to be airlifted to Germany by the same Berlin-based non-profit that had aided him. Verzilov has said his symptoms were very similar to Navalny’s and has blamed both poisonings personally on Putin. The Charité hospital treating Navalny has said its analysis showed he is suffering from poisoning from cholinesterase inhibitors, chemicals that belong to a very broad group of substances ranging from pesticides and medication to military grade nerve agents, that includes Novichok. Dan Kaszeta, a chemical and biological weapons expert and the author of a book on nerve agents, ""Toxic"", told ABC News on Tuesday that without knowing what the substance was for now it was impossible to say if whatever had poisoned Navalny had been developed in a sophisticated military lab or something more commonly available. Andrei Soldatov, a long-time expert on the Russian security services and author of ""The Compatriots,"" a history of Russian espionage abroad, including poisonings, said he did not believe a figure with Navalny's position in Russia could have been targeted without the Kremlin's order. ""I’ve been hearing this argument for like many years. From Politkovskaya, to Litvinenko, to Skripal. That it could not be possibly the Kremlin but someone trying to please the Kremlin,"" Soldatov said by phone Wednesday. ""But the problem with this argument is that in 2020 the situation is not what we had in 2004, 2006. The room for any kind of unsanctioned activity from the secret services especially in such a sensitive area is very limited. It’s really difficult to imagine that somebody would dare to do something that drastic and not first secure some kind of agreement. To be sure that he or she is on the safe side.""",3,,,,26
2020-08-06,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/International/ammonium-nitrate-explosive-fertilizer-heart-beiruts-disaster/story?id=72210606,Beirut explosion: A look at ammonium nitrate,"PARIS and LONDON -- An explosion at a warehouse stocked with 2,750 tons of ammonium nitrate in the Beirut port changed the face of a city almost instantly. The exact cause of the Beirut blast is still under investigation, but the catastrophic effects of ammonium nitrate were there for all to see: A massive explosion causing shock waves throughout the city and a mushroom cloud of smoke billowing high into the sky. So far, at least 137 are confirmed dead, including one American, and over 5,000 were injured in the blast, according to the Lebanese authorities. But, according to experts, ammonium nitrate is not itself classified as dangerous, and requires a lot of energy to ignite. ""[Ammonium nitrate] is a great fertilizer for growing plants, but it's also wonderful as an explosive,"" Jimmy Oxley, a chemistry professor at the University of Rhode Island, told ABC News. ""200 factories make ammonium nitrate around the world… They are mining all over."" Ammonium nitrate was involved in the 1947 Texas City disaster, one of the largest industrial explosions in history. But the chemical has a more nefarious use -- as an explosive. The chemical compound was used to make explosives for the Oklahoma City bombing that killed 168 people 25 years ago. The fertilizer and fuel bomb used then contained just over two tons of ammonium nitrate to carry out the deadliest domestic terror attack on U.S. soil. The warehouse in Beirut is believed to have carried more than 1,000 times that amount. Yet, Oxley, who carried out research into the chemical compound, said that while the ammonium nitrate has been used as an explosive, the compound cannot be solely responsible for the explosion. ""The product itself is not classified as dangerous,"" said Gilles Choquet, president of AIS service, a training organization in risk prevention in explosive environments. ""It is the storage of this product that could generate risks, with the rise in temperatures, which will be all the greater when there is so much product."" Port officials have been placed on house arrest pending the results of the investigation on the suspected gross negligence of leaving the over 2,500 tons in the port's warehouse for six years, Lebanon President Michel Aoun announced. The ammonium nitrate appears to have been confiscated from a commercial cargo ship abandoned in Beirut in 2013, allegedly with a Russian owner, and then confiscated by the Lebanese authorities a year later; it's origins linked to former Soviet republic, Georgia. ""I'm not surprised it's coming from Georgia or Russia,"" Oxley said. ""Cheap natural gas [is] there, and natural gas is one of the precursors for making ammonium nitrate."" The chemical, however, requires a lot of energy to become explosive, and is not, in itself, highly combustible. ""What is certain is that when this product is on its own, it cannot explode,"" Choquet said. At the moment, it is ""hard to say the exact cause for the explosion,"" he said, and the authorities may never find one. The earliest recorded accident involving ammonium nitrate occurred in Oppau in Germany in 1921. ""The man was blasting it with dynamite,"" said Oxley about the Oppau explosion. ""He got away with that several times. One day he decided to do a bunch of dynamite at once, 600 people died and he was one of them. He put a shock into the ammonium nitrate ... in [Beirut's] situation, if there was a pre-shock into the ammonium nitrate, that would explain what was going on."" According to Oxley, this pre-shock could have been the fireworks; speculated as the cause early on. ""If they got on fire and started a large conflagration, it could come from that,"" Oxley said. ""Ammonium nitrate mixed with fuel will just sit there and look at you ... [to become explosive] it has to have a large input of energy, either from a large fire or a shock wave.""",3,,,,24
2020-07-29,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/us-withdraw-12000-troops-germany/story?id=72051446,"US to withdraw 12,000 troops from Germany","The United States is removing nearly 12,000 American troops from Germany and will move the headquarters of U.S. European Command from Germany to Belgium in a major repositioning of forces that the Pentagon says is intended to increase the deterrence of Russia but that President Donald Trump said on Wednesday was tied to Germany not spending enough on its defense budget. Of the U.S. troops stationed in Germany, 6,400 will return to the United States. Another 5,400 will be moved to other locations in Europe that already house American troops, and troops from the U.S. will rotate into locations in southeastern Europe -- strengthening NATO's presence in that part of the region. ""The alliance will be all the better and stronger,"" Defense Secretary Mark Esper said in announcing the changes at a Pentagon news conference on Wednesday. Esper announced that 11,900 U.S. military personnel will leave Germany, reducing the American troop presence there from 36,000 to 24,000. The U.S. has maintained mostly Army and Air Force service members in Germany since the end of World War II and continues to use its facilities as a major hub for troops stationed in other locations overseas. ""Nearly 5,600 service members will be repositioned within NATO countries and approximately 6,400 will return to the United States, though many of these or similar units will begin conducting rotational deployments,"" Esper said. The troop moves will include moving the headquarters of U.S. European Command from Stuttgart, Germany, to Mons, Belgium, where it will be co-located with NATO's military headquarters. ""This will strengthen NATO and improve the operational efficiency and readiness of over 2,000 service members in these headquarters,"" Esper said. Gen. Tod Wolters, the head of U.S. European Command and NATO's Supreme Allied Commander, said a proposal was also being considered to move the headquarters of U.S. Africa Command to another location in Europe. The troop adjustments in Germany are the largest in almost a decade and while the Pentagon is framing the troop reduction in the context of improving the deterrence against Russia in Europe, Esper acknowledged that the move was ""accelerated"" by new guidance from Trump in June calling for a troop reduction. That guidance surprised European allies and seemed tied to Trump's displeasure that Germany does not contribute 2% of its Gross Domestic Product (GDP) toward its defense, a goal of NATO countries. On Wednesday, before departing for a trip to Texas, Trump directly linked the move of troops out to Germany's defense spending. ""We're reducing the force, because they're not paying their bills. It's very simple. They're delinquent. Very simple,"" Trump said. ""We spend a lot of money on Germany,"" he added. ""They take advantage of us on trade and they take advantage of the military so we're reducing the troops."" ""Germany is not paying for it,"" Trump added. ""So why should we leave them if they were not -- we don't want to be the suckers anymore."" Asked about Trump's comments, Esper reiterated his belief that Germany should put 2% or more of its spending toward defense needs to meet the NATO standard. ""I think Germany is the wealthiest country in Europe, Germany can and should pay more to its defense,"" said Esper, reiterating his previous stance on the subject of Germany's defense spending levels. ""It should certainly meet the 2% standard and I would argue go above and beyond that."" ""I've said that very publicly. I've said that very privately to my counterparts, as well about the importance of NATO, and the alliance, sharing the burden, so we can all deter Russia,"" said Esper. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said in a statement that the U.S. plan ""underlines the continued commitment by the United States to NATO"" and that the U.S. had consulted with all NATO allies ahead of the announcement. Meanwhile, the German Defense and Foreign Ministries issued a bland statement noting the announcement and that Germany ""will coordinate closely with the federal states concerned, the U.S. government, and within NATO with a view to further implementation."" Last week, Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla., the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said in a statement that he was satisfied with the plans he had been briefed on ahead of time, but criticism of the planned move of forces has crossed party lines. Sen. Jack Reed, D-R.I., the ranking Democrat on the committee described the move as ""a self-inflicted wound by President Trump against American interests"" and ""an irrational and ill-conceived proposal."" Reed also said the plan was not based on a strategic rationale and could embolden Russia's ambitions in Europe. The top Democrat and Republican on the House Armed Services Committee both criticized troop levels that they perceive to be ""arbitrary."" Rep. Adam Smith, D-Wash., expressed concerns that the plan would strain relationships with European partners and is ""based on an arbitrary cap imposed on numbers of forward-stationed U.S. forces in a given country, rather than an underlying analysis of military need and national security justification."" Rep. Mac Thornberry, R-Texas, said that while some of the plan has merit ""other aspects -- such as an arbitrary limit to the number of troops stationed in certain countries -- remain troubling. "" Calling the plans ""a grave error"" and a ""gift to Russia"" Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, was among those Senate Republicans who said it would embolden Russian aggression. ""It is a slap in the face at a friend and ally when we should instead be drawing closer in our mutual commitment to deter Russian and Chinese aggression,"" he added. ""We should be leading our allies against China and Russia, not abandoning them,"" said Sen. Ben Sasse, R-Neb. "" Withdrawal is weak."" Wolters said the movement of troops out of Germany will afford NATO greater flexibility and reach in northeastern and southeastern Europe. ""The flexibility it affords us certainly complicates a potential enemy against us, and it dramatically improves our operational capability,"" Wolters said. Soldiers numbering 4,500 from the Army's Second Cavalry Regiment, an armored Stryker unit, will return to the United States, but other Stryker units will rotate to the Black Sea region of Eastern Europe. Esper said the move would give the United States ""a more enduring presence to enhance deterrence and reassure allies along NATO's southeastern flank."" An F-16 squadron is also being moved from Germany to Italy, most likely to Aviano Air Base which is home to other F-16 units, to also boost the presence in southern Europe. Esper said the Army's newly established Fifth Corps headquarters will also be moved to Poland. There is no total price tag associated yet with the planned moves, though Esper estimated that the costs could be less than $10 billion. While some of the moves could begin quickly, a senior defense official told reporters that the whole process could take years as some construction will have to be undertaken both stateside and overseas to accommodate the movement of forces. ""The plan to remove our troops from Germany will be at the detriment of our national security interests,"" said Mick Mulroy, an ABC News contributor and a former deputy assistant secretary of defense for the Middle East. ""It will cost billions, it will drive a wedge in NATO and it will be a gift to Russia."" Mulroy said that at a time when Russian intelligence is alleged to have run a bounty program to target American troops in Afghanistan, the U.S. ""should be looking at ways to sanction them.""

2020-07-24,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/pentagon-calls-russia-testing-anti-satellite-weapon/story?id=71945791,Pentagon calls out Russia for testing anti-satellite weapon,"U.S. Space Command has accused Russia of testing an anti-satellite weapon in space last week, when an orbiting Russian military satellite released an object that headed in the direction of another Russian satellite. This marks the second time in three years that Russia has tested new technologies that could lead to so-called ""killer satellites."" ""U.S. Space Command has evidence that Russia conducted a non-destructive test of a space-based anti-satellite weapon,"" according to a statement issued Thursday. ""On 15 July, Russia injected a new object into orbit from Cosmos 2543, currently Satellite Catalog Number 45915 in www.space-track.org."" In a separate statement, Air Vice-Marshal Harvey Smyth, the head of the UK's space directorate, said, ""We are concerned by the manner in which Russia tested one of its satellites by launching a projectile with the characteristics of a weapon."" ""Actions of this kind threaten the peaceful use of space and risk causing debris that could pose a threat to satellites and the space systems on which the world depends,"" said Smyth. ""We call on Russia to avoid any further such testing."" Last week's test was similar to one carried out in 2017, when a Russian satellite ""ejected"" or ""birthed"" a smaller sub-satellite that Russia have labeled inspector satellites because they can approach other satellites to ""inspect"" for damage. But the 2017 test created major concerns among U.S. officials because of what happened next. The Russian inspector satellite moved close to a U.S. government satellite and, after shadowing it for quite some time, it fired a fast-moving projectile that traveled into space. That test raised concerns that Russia had developed the weapons technology for a ""killer satellite"" that could target satellites belonging to the United States or its partners. Last week's test was almost an exact duplicate of the 2017 incident, except that the sub-satellite had been shadowing another Russian military satellite before it fired a projectile. ""The Russian satellite system used to conduct this on-orbit weapons test is the same satellite system that we raised concerns about earlier this year, when Russia maneuvered near a U.S. government satellite,"" said Gen. John W. ""Jay"" Raymond, the commander of U.S. Space Command and the chief of space operations for the Space Force. ""This is further evidence of Russia's continuing efforts to develop and test space-based systems, and -- consistent with the Kremlin's published military doctrine -- to employ weapons that hold U.S. and allied space assets at risk,"" he said on Thursday. Meanwhile Russia's Defense Ministry said in a statement last week that the test merely involved an inspector satellite approaching another Russian satellite. Raymond has not been shy in criticizing Russia's new space-weapon capabilities. In February, Raymond first disclosed in a Space News interview that Russian satellite Cosmos-2542, launched in November, had ejected a sub-satellite, Cosmos-2543, the same satellite involved in last week's test. He said both satellites had been ""actively maneuvering"" near a U.S. government satellite that space watchers identified as USA-245, an advanced American spy satellite. In April, Raymond provided more details of that encounter saying the maneuvers the two Russian satellites carried out while shadowing the American satellite ""would be interpreted as irresponsible and potentially threatening in any other domain. Raymond's comments were included in a Space Command press release that criticized Russia for testing a direct-ascent, anti-satellite missile capable of destroying satellites in low-earth orbit. Ironically, earlier on Thursday, during a phone call between President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin both leaders discussed a bright spot in U.S.-Russian space cooperation, the 45th anniversary of the Apollo-Soyuz space mission.

2020-07-22,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/International/russia-convicts-historian-yuri-dmitriyev-uncovered-stalins-mass/story?id=71920035,Russia convicts historian Yuri Dmitriyev who uncovered Stalin's mass graves,"A Russian court sentenced a historian who helped uncover mass graves from Stalin's ""Great Terror"" campaign to 3 1/2 years in jail, on charges widely criticized by rights groups as fabricated and viewed as part of an effort by Russian authorities to whitewash dark chapters of the country's Soviet history. However, the historian, Yuri Dmitriyev, avoided what his supporters had feared would be a much longer prison term. Prosecutors had sought a 15-year jail sentence for Dmitriyev but the court's decision means that because of time already served, he will be released in November. Dmitriyev, 64, heads a local branch of Memorial, a human rights group that commemorates the victims of Soviet repression. He has faced criminal prosecution since 2016, when he was accused by police of taking pornographic photographs of his adopted underage daughter. A court in April 2018 acquitted Dmitriyev of the charges, but a higher court overturned the ruling and ordered further investigation. In 2018, police brought the case once again and added a fresh charge alleging he had violently sexually abused his daughter. Dmitriyev was arrested and placed in pre-trial detention. An expert witness told the court the photographs were not pornographic and that psychological evaluations have shown no evidence that Dmitriyev is a pedophile. Dmitriyev said he took the photos to document the girl's health in order to prove to child welfare officers she was well-cared for. International and Russian human rights groups have condemned the trial as an attempt to smear one of the country's most prominent researchers of mass graves of victims murdered under Joseph Stalin. On Wednesday, the court in the Karelia region where Dmitriyev lives, convicted him on the charge of violent sexual abuse, handing down the 3 1/2-year sentence. But it acquitted him on the original pornography charges. Dmitriyev's supporters expressed disgust at the court's decision but hailed it as a victory because he will be freed soon. ""The absolute groundlessness of the accusations was obvious from the very start. And such a sentence for such a grave accusation means one thing: that there is no evidence of Dmitriyev's real guilt,"" Memorial wrote in a statement. ""Nonetheless, these accusations have already taken more than three years of Yuri Dmitryev's freedom and crippled the fate of his adopted daughter,"" the statement continued. ""By today's standards this is as good as them acquitting him,"" Evgeny Roizman, a prominent opposition politician wrote on Twitter. Dmitriyev's case has attracted international criticism. Human Rights Watch has previously called the charges ""bogus."" In May, the British government said it was ""deeply concerned"" by his detention. Dmitriyev's prosecution has coincided with an effort to alter the history of the grave sites in his region, Karelia, which borders Finland. In the 1990s Dmitriyev and others discovered a number of mass graves linked to Stalin's Gulag prison system in Russia. One grave site in Sandarmokh contained the bodies of over 6,000 prisoners murdered by Soviet secret police during the ""Great Terror"" (also known as the ""Great Purge"") between 1937-38. But in recent years, there has been an effort by a state-backed group to suggest that the Sandarmokh graves also contain the bodies of Red Army prisoners of war executed by Finnish troops during World War II. The theory is being promoted by Russia's Military-Historical Society, an organization known for its nationalist outlook and whose members include many senior Russian government officials. In 2018, members of the organization dug in the graves and found 16 soldiers' corpses which they believe proves that Soviet secret police were not the only ones involved in killing at Sandarmokh. Critics say the effort is meant to muddy the waters around the graves and take focus away from the Stalinist mass killings. It comes against the backdrop of a wider campaign under president Vladimir Putin in the last several years to downplay the importance of Soviet crimes in Russian history and rehabilitate Stalin's image. Memorial has faced a series of dubious criminal investigations in recent years. Last year, Memorial activists in Perm, located in central Russia, were accused by police of ""illegal logging"" for cutting away brush around a cemetery where Lithuanians and Poles displaced under Stalin are buried. The organization, which also campaigns against present-day abuses, has also seen its offices raided and its members have faced intimidation.",13,,,,26
2020-07-21,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/International/armed-man-takes-20-hostages-bus-ukraine-explosives/story?id=71891210,"Ukraine bus siege ends with all 13 hostages freed, suspect in custody","A tense day-long stand-off between Ukrainian police and a heavily armed man who took 13 people hostage on board a bus in western Ukraine has ended after police detained the gunman and all the hostages were released. Authorities had been negotiating with the man for most of Tuesday after he boarded the bus and told police he had rigged the vehicle with explosives and was taking the passengers hostage. Police launched a major operation, cordoning off the bus in a main square and officers trained guns on it. Several shots were fired throughout the day and there had been fears the stand-off could end in a bloodbath. By late evening though, the gunman surrendered. Video broadcast live by Ukrainian media at the scene showed special forces officers on an armored car racing up to the bus where a police negotiator was already standing. Afterwards, hostages were seen being led from the bus. Deputy Interior Minister Anton Gerashchenko posted photographs on his Facebook page showing the suspected gunman face down on the ground surrounded by officers, as well as video of exhausted-looking hostages walking away from the bus. The stand-off finally ended shortly after Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskiy called the gunman and fulfilled one of his demands -- to post a video in which he called on people to watch the 2005 documentary film, 'Earthlings."" A film by that name in 2005, directed by Shaun Monson and narrated by Joaquin Phoenix, depicts human's exploitation of animals. Zelenskiy posted a video telling people to watch the film on his official Facebook account, as well as some posts from the gunman with another demand that top Ukrainian officials, Orthodox church leaders and prominent oligarchs make video statements in which they would call themselves ""terrorists."" Ukrainian officials afterwards said an agreement had been reached with the gunman during a 15-minute phone-call with Zelenskiy, whereby he would surrender if Zelenskiy posted the video. Immediately after the gunman was detained the posts were deleted from Zelenskiy's Facebook page. Shortly before the stand-off ended, the gunman had freed 3 female hostages, who were allowed to walk to safety with a senior police commander, Evgeny Koval. Koval, deputy head of Ukraine's National Police, approached the bus repeatedly to negotiate. On one occasion video showed the gunman fired a shot over Koval's head. Not long after that and after Zelenskiy posted the video, the gunman surrendered. Zelenskiy hailed the end of the siege afterwards in a statement on his Telegram channel, praising rescuers. ""The life of a person is the most important value. We have lost no one. Today the family and friends can be with everyone who suffered through the day in the bus under the gun sight. Terrorism has not place in any country,"" Zelenskiy wrote. Police identified the hostage-taker as Maksym S. Kryvosh, 44, originally born in Russia. Local media have reported that Kryvosh's parents had lived in Lutsk. According to Ukraine's Interior Ministry, Kriyvosh has previously been convicted twice by a court in the city in 1994 and 2005 of serious crimes, including fraud and illegal possession of arms and explosives. He has spent a total of 10 years in prison, deputy interior minister Gerashchenko said. The stand-off began mid-morning when the gunman called police from the bus saying he was hijacking it and that he had a large amount of explosives. He claimed to also have planted a bomb in another part of the city which he said he could detonate remotely. The gunman introduced himself to police as ""Maksym Plokhoy"" and posted demands on social media accounts under that name. The posts included the demands that the heads of numerous Ukrainian government and judicial bodies, as well as Orthodox church leaders and prominent oligarchs make videos where they would say there were terrorists. In the posts, he wished people ""Happy Anti-System Day"" and wrote that the state was a terrorist. Among the texts were also the demand that Zelenskiy speak about the film. In a video on the page, a man believed to be Kryvosh sits in a black beret while holding a cut-down assault rifle. A few hours after the stand-off began, authorities in Ukraine's capital Kyiv said police had disarmed two explosive devices at a market in the city. Local media reported that several more bomb threats were also called into public buildings in Kyiv and the eastern city Kharkiv.

2020-07-21,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/doj-charges-alleged-chinese-hackers-stealing-trade-secrets/story?id=71897082,"DOJ charges alleged Chinese hackers for stealing trade secrets, targeting firms working on COVID-19 vaccine","The Justice Department has announced an 11-count indictment charging two alleged Chinese hackers accused of carrying out a massive global cyber intrusion campaign on behalf of the Chinese government in which they stole ""hundreds of millions of dollars"" worth of trade secrets, and most recently sought to target companies conducting research for a COVID-19 vaccine. Li Xiaoyu and Dong Jiazhi, both Chinese nationals currently living in China, are alleged in the indictment to be active leaders of a hacking campaign that has been ongoing for more than 10 years and has targeted hundreds of companies in more than 11 countries, including the U.S. ""The defendants stole hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of trade secrets, intellectual property, and other valuable business information,"" said Tuesday's unsealed indictment. Their primary goal, according to federal prosecutors, was not only personal financial gain but to hand over stolen data and hacked information to China's Ministry of State Security and other Chinese government agencies. ""The hackers stole terabytes of data which comprised a sophisticated and prolific threat to U.S. networks,"" the DOJ said in a press release. ""More recently, the defendants probed for vulnerabilities in computer networks of companies developing COVID-19 vaccines, testing technology, and treatments."" ""In this manner, China has now taken its place, alongside Russia, Iran, and North Korea, in that shameful club of nations that provide a safe haven for cyber criminals in exchange for those criminals being 'on call' to work for the benefit of the state, here to feed the Chinese Communist Party’s insatiable hunger for American and other non-Chinese companies' hard-earned intellectual property, including COVID-19 research,"" Assistant Attorney General John Demers said in a news conference Tuesday. While the Justice Department said at least four American companies working on coronavirus treatment and testing were targeted by Xiaoyu and Jiazhi, the indictment from the U.S. attorneys office in Spokane, Washington, does not allege the two hackers successfully accessed any firms' networks or data and stole COVID-related research. According to the indictment, Xiaoyu and Jiazhi were allegedly able to steal information ""regarding military satellite programs; military wireless networks and communications systems; high-powered microwave and laser systems; a counter-chemical weapons system; and ship-to-helicopter integration systems."" And their alleged activity on behalf of the Chinese Communist Party's government, according to the Justice Department, was not limited simply to stealing intellectual property. The indictment states that Xiaoyu and Jiazhi also provided China's Ministry of State Security with the personal data of Chinese dissidents and other critics of the government. Specifically, Xiaoyu and Jiazhi were able compromise the email accounts and passwords of a Hong Kong community organizer, a pastor of a Christian church in Xi'an, China, and a dissident and former Tianenmen Square protester, according to the indictment. They additionally stole emails from a Chinese Christian pastor in Chengdu just days after his church was banned by the government -- and the Justice Department says the pastor was subsequently arrested. While the FBI on Tuesday issued a wanted bulletin for both men and identified them as fugitives, it's unlikely that Xiaoyu and Jiazhi will ever see the inside of a U.S. courtroom. Law enforcement officials at Tuesday's press conference said the indictment primarily serves to publicly identify the two hackers, whose efforts were not previously being tracked, as a threat to the private sector in addition to raising broader awareness regarding malicious cyber activity being carried out by China. In May, the FBI issued its first public warning that Chinese government hackers were seeking to steal data from firms conducting COVID-19 research and testing. A DOJ official confirmed Tuesday's indictment contains the first publicly announced charges against Chinese nationals attempting to do so.",3,,,,29
2020-07-21,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/International/russian-influence-uk-normal-widely-anticipated-report-claims/story?id=71892151,"Russian influence in the UK is the 'new normal,' widely anticipated report claims","LONDON -- A highly-anticipated report by the U.K. Parliament into Russian interference in the country was released on Tuesday, claiming that Russian influence in the U.K. is the “new normal.” The Russia Report, published after months of delay, is the culmination of two years of fact finding by the U.K. Parliament’s Intelligence and Security Committee (ICS), providing insights on the Salisbury Novichok poisonings, Russian financial influence and social media disinformation. The report said the U.K. was a ""top target"" for Russian interference. The publication of the report comes a week after security services in the U.S., U.K. and Canada said that Russian hackers had been attempting to hack into global coronavirus vaccine research. The Kremlin has denied the accusations. However, the report will likely disappoint observers who expected the ICS to detail how far Russia interfered in the bitterly contested Brexit Referendum of 2016. Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s was accused of withholding the publication of the report until after the election of December 2019, a claim they denied. The Russia Report claims the security threat to Western countries posed by Russia is particularly difficult to manage as their aims are “fundamentally nihilistic.” “Russia seems to see foreign policy as a zero-sum game: any actions it can take which damage the West are fundamentally good for Russia,” the Report said. Overall, the ICS assessed Russia’s long term aim as to be seen as a “great power,” reach a level of global influence similar to the former Soviet Union, and preserve the current structure of leadership. As the result of a recent referendum, the Russian constitution was changed to give President Putin the right to potentially remain in power until 2036. The Russia Report described Russian interference in the U.K. as “the new normal,” particularly on a financial level. Many Russians with close links to Vladimir Putin have been accepted into the country because of their wealth, and integrated into the “business and social scene.” “This level of integration – in ‘Londongrad’ in particular – means that any measures now being taken by the Government are not preventative but rather constitute damage limitation,” the Report said. With British governments having welcomed Russian oligarchs and their money, many have connections at the “highest levels” of British politics. An industry of lawyers, accountants and estate agents help enable this influence, it added. On combatting the widely-reported ways in which Russian state-linked groups have used social media to spread disinformation, the Report said: “it is the social media companies which hold the key and yet are failing to play their part.” Russia’s cyber capability is a matter of “grave concern,” it added. The ICS said they had produced a shorter report than usual the case so as not share underlying details that could be analysed by the Russian Intelligence Services. In a line critical of the response of British security services to counter Russian meddling, the ICS said: “was not immediately apparent how these various agencies and organisations are co-ordinated and indeed complement each other.” The Report concludes that new legislation in required to deal with Russian interference, as well as a stronger and better co-ordinated response from the international community and among British security bodies. ""We’ve been clear that Russia must desist from its attacks on the UK & our allies,"" the Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab tweeted after the report was published. ""We will be resolute in defending our country, our democracy & our values from such Hostile State Activity."" The Kremlin was quick to deny that Russia had interfered in any foreign countries. Russia’s foreign ministry dismissed the report, saying it had been overhyped and motivated by “Russophobia."" ""Sensation didn't happen. Fake-shaped Russophobia"" Maria Zakharova, the Russian Foreign Ministry's spokeswoman said, according to Interfax, a Russian news agency.",3,,,,11
2020-07-16,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/International/russia-linked-hackers-accused-stealing-covid-vaccine-data/story?id=71819152,What to know about the Russia-linked hackers accused of stealing COVID vaccine data,"The Russian hacking group accused on Thursday by the U.K., U.S. and Canada of seeking to steal information on potential COVID-19 vaccines is a familiar name to cybersecurity experts. APT-29, or Advanced Persistent Threat 29, is better known to many as ""Cozy Bear."" It's one of two hacking groups cybersecurity researchers have long linked to Russia's intelligence services and which has been accused of playing a prominent role in interfering with U.S. elections in 2016. Cybersecurity researchers have suggested the group is directed by Russia's domestic intelligence service, the FSB, though more recently they have come to believe its belongs to Russia's foreign intelligence service, the SVR. Also referred to as ""The Dukes,"" APT-29 is known for trying to steal intelligence from think tanks, political groups and activists. ""Cozy Bear"" gained notoriety in the U.S. after allegedly helping hack into the Democratic National Committee's computers. In 2016, the group was accused of breaking into the DNC's servers alongside a second hacking group -- APT-28, aka ""Fancy Bear"" -- that researchers and U.S. intelligence services have linked to the GRU, Russia's military intelligence agency. APT-28 was accused of playing the more significant role, stealing DNC emails and data and then dumping it online to harm the Democratic party. The Department of Justice in 2018 indicted 12 GRU officers over that operation. ""Cozy Bear"" by contrast was described by researchers as quieter and more discreet. The two hacking groups duplicating some of each other's efforts suggests they were unaware of each other's operations, the cybersecurity firm Crowdstrike said at the time. In 2018, Dutch media reported that the Netherlands' intelligence service, the AIVD, had successfully managed to break into the computers used by APT29, locating them in a university building close to the Red Square in Moscow. Hackers from the AIVD's Joint Sigint Cyber Unit reportedly had compromised the group since 2014, allowing them to watch in real time as they carried out attacks, including those involving the 2016 U.S. election. The Dutch hackers reportedly even managed to access a CCTV camera overlooking the building, allowing them to identify those inside. Dutch intelligence shared the information with the FBI and the National Security Agency. The Dutch reportedly concluded APT-29 was most likely linked to the SVR. In 2017, Norwegian police said ""Cozy Bear"" targeted several government ministries and the country's left-wing Labour party. The same year, the Dutch government ordered votes in Holland's general election to be counted by hand after Dutch intelligence said the Russian hackers had targeted ministries. The Slovakian cybersecurity firm ESET in October 2019 said it uncovered another years-long campaign by APT-29 that targeted at least three European foreign ministries. APT-29 is known for using spear-phishing campaigns, which attempt to trick email users into clicking on infected links that deliver malware onto that person's machine, which is overtaken by the hackers who can steal data as well as login credentials. A report into the election hack by the Department of Homeland Security and the FBI in December 2016 found that APT-29 had run a spear-fishing campaign in the summer 2015 that included more than 1,000 recipients, including U.S. government targets. The group's tactics apparently have become more sophisticated in recent years, developing methods designed to trick even some of the most careful targets, researchers have found. APT-29's target list has been found to coincide with those who would be of interest to Russia's government -- intelligence useful in foreign policy or for targeting critics.",3,,,,11
2020-07-16,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/International/us-uk-canada-claim-russia-hack-coronavirus-vaccine/story?id=71818654,"Russia tried to hack coronavirus vaccine research, US, UK and Canada say","LONDON -- A ""cyber espionage group"" associated with the Russian intelligence services has attempted to hack into coronavirus vaccine research in the U.S., Britain and Canada, according to a report from the U.K.'s National Cyber Security Center. The U.S. National Security Agency agreed with that report. ""Throughout 2020, APT29 has targeted various organizations involved in COVID-19 vaccine development in Canada, the United States and the United Kingdom, highly likely with the intention of stealing information and intellectual property relating to the development and testing of COVID-19 vaccines,"" the NCSC report said. APT29, also known as ""the Dukes"" or ""Cozy Bear,"" is one of the Russian Intelligence Service entities identified in the FBI's assessment of malicious cyber activity in the 2016 presidential election. ""It is completely unacceptable that the Russian Intelligence Services are targeting those working to combat the coronavirus pandemic,"" Dominic Raab, the U.K.'s foreign secretary, said in response to the advisory. ""While others pursue their selfish interests with reckless behavior, the U.K. and its allies are getting on with the hard work of finding a vaccine and protecting global health."" He added, ""The U.K. will continue to counter those conducting such cyber attacks and work with our allies to hold perpetrators to account."" The NCSC's advisory lays out indicators of compromise and detection rules for companies involved in vaccine research, and warns that APT29 ""is likely to continue to target organizations involved in COVID-19 vaccine research and development, as they seek to answer additional intelligence questions relating to the pandemic."" Anne Neuberger, NSA's cybersecurity director, said the report would help to encourage everyone to ""take this threat seriously."" ""The National Security Agency (NSA), along with our partners, remains steadfast in its commitment to protecting national security by collectively issuing this critical cybersecurity advisory as foreign actors continue to take advantage of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic,"" Neuberger said in a statement to ABC News. ""APT29 has a long history of targeting governmental, diplomatic, think-tank, healthcare and energy organizations for intelligence gain so we encourage everyone to take this threat seriously and apply the mitigations issued in the advisory.” In May, the FBI and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency said Chinese-affiliated “cyber actors and nontraditional collectors” were attempting to steal research related to COVID-19 vaccines and treatment. ""The potential theft of this information jeopardizes the delivery of secure, effective and efficient treatment options,"" the Department of Homeland Security said in a statement. ""Russia’s efforts to steal information regarding COVID-19 vaccine development is part of an ongoing pattern of behavior by hostile foreign intelligence services to use cyberattacks as a means to gather sensitive information and even conduct covert attacks,"" ABC News' national security contributor John Cohen said. ""The growing use of these techniques by countries like Russia, China, North Korea and Iran represent a significant national security threat to the U.S. and other western nations."" The Kremlin has denied Russian involvement in the hacking of pharmaceutical companies as well as allegations that it interfered in the 2019 U.K. election, Russian news agency RIA Novosti reported.",3,,,,11
2020-06-24,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/polish-presidents-white-house-visit-raises-questions-us/story?id=71414658,Polish president's White House visit raises questions about US troops in Germany,"Poland's President Andrzej Duda's visit to the White House on Wednesday prompts a question about whether the U.S. will increase its military presence in Poland as the Pentagon draws down troop levels in nearby Germany. He is the first head of state to visit President Donald Trump in person in months as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. Senior administration officials said both the U.S. and Polish delegations participating in the meetings at the White House will be tested for the coronavirus but wouldn't go into detail about any other COVID-related precautions that are being taken. Those officials previewing the visit said it was ""premature"" to say if troops departing Germany will relocate to Poland and repeatedly directed reporters to an op-ed published in the Wall Street Journal by national security adviser Robert O'Brien. In that op-ed, O'Brien said, ""several thousand troops currently assigned to Germany may be reassigned to other countries in Europe"" but did not specify the countries. Earlier this month, Trump told reporters at the White House that the U.S. was ""going to bring down the soldier count to 25,000 soldiers"" from ""around 52,000 now."" While rotations mean troop levels can rise to as high as 52,000, there are approximately 34,674 U.S. troops stationed in Germany, according to the latest Department of Defense data from March. Trump has been outspoken in his claim that Germany is ""delinquent"" on ""their payments to NATO."" Although countries cannot be ""delinquent"" on their own defense spending, in 2006 and 2014, NATO countries agreed they would each spend 2% of their GDP on defense budgets. Germany, along with most other member states, has not lived up to that pledge. Trump cited that as grounds to withdraw U.S. troops. U.S. troops in Germany have been a critical part of NATO's deterrence against Russian aggression in Europe, but the country is also home to American operations beyond the continent, including U.S. Africa Command's headquarters in Stuttgart and Landstuhl hospital, the largest American military hospital outside the U.S. Asked by a reporter Tuesday what message a hypothetical troop relocation from Germany to Poland would send to Russia, a senior administration official would not elaborate beyond O'Brien's op-ed except to say ""the constant message is that we have an unshakeable alliance with our NATO partners and that Poland is an extremely important, valued, and responsible member of that alliance."" While the officials wouldn't discuss troops, they touted progress in establishing a combat training center in Poland. ""The U.S. Army has already established an area support group that can be tailored to support an increase of U.S. soldiers in Poland. Despite the pandemic, we've had very successful exercises -- a sign, I think, to anyone who doubts NATO's readiness and U.S. commitment to the Alliance,"" an official said. The officials said the U.S. and Poland were working on the ""final details"" of the Defense Cooperation Agreement between the two countries and that, once signed, ""the U.S. Air Force plans to rotate an MQ-9 Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance squadron into Poland and establish an aerial port of debarkation."" An official said they've also ""agreed on a location for the armored brigade combat team -- ABCT -- and are in discussions regarding additional infrastructure to support the ABCT, as well as the combat aviation brigade and combat support sustainment battalion.""

2020-05-26,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/US/spacex-nasa-set-milestone-launch-astronauts-international-space/story?id=70786063,SpaceX and NASA set for 'milestone' launch of astronauts to the International Space Station,"In a historic moment for the U.S. space program, NASA and SpaceX are set to launch American astronauts into space on a U.S. spacecraft and from U.S. soil for the first time in nearly a decade. ""This is a milestone in the history of the U.S. space program. It's only the fifth time that people have been launched on a new U.S. spacecraft,"" John Logsdon, a professor emeritus at George Washington University's Space Policy Institute and former member of the NASA Advisory Council, told ABC News. The SpaceX Demo-2 test flight will carry NASA astronauts Robert Behnken and Douglas Hurley to the International Space Station and is scheduled for launch on Wednesday. If all goes as planned, the Crew Dragon spacecraft, propelled by a Falcon 9 rocket, will dock at the space station just before noon on Thursday. As of Tuesday, the weather forecast for the area of the launch site includes scattered thunderstorms and wind gusts of up to 15 mph. Electrically charged cumulonimbus clouds could also be in the vicinity of the launch area tomorrow. Video on Tuesday showed SpaceX engineers doing the final maintenance touches on the Falcon 9 rocket, replacing filters to help make sure the Crew Dragon capsule remains cool ahead of Wednesday's launch. Tune into live coverage of the historic launch on ABC News Live and National Geographic on Wednesday, May 27, starting at 3 p.m. ET. Also, check back at ABCNews.com for live updates. The mission passed its Flight Readiness Review, the final major hurdle before lift-off, on Friday. The last time the U.S. sent Americans into space on U.S. equipment and from U.S. soil was in July of 2011, during the last Space Shuttle flight. The coronavirus pandemic down here on Earth took center stage during a virtual news briefing with the astronauts on Friday. ""We’ve been tested at least twice so far, and rumor has it we might be tested again before we go,"" Hurley said. ""I think in general that seems like plenty, especially considering we’ve been in, for all intents and purposes, a quarantine now since about March 15."" As active astronatus, they are also used to having their health screened closely, Hurley said. ""We just, I think after all these years, are kind of used to the poking and prodding and blood draws and all of the things that come along with flying into space,"" he said. He added that he estimated they have ""been in quarantine probably longer than any space crew has ever been in the history of the space program."" Behnken added, however, that this is the first time, ""we've seen the rest of the world have to take on the same precautions that we do leading up to the launch."" In this time of mounting uncertainty, Behnken said he hopes the nation can find hope in watching the historic launch amid the global crisis. ""I hope the nation can look at this and recognize that this is something that we are still going to accomplish, this is still something that we are still going to be successful at and we’re going to do it in the face of the pandemic,"" he added. ""We’ll figure out a way to work through it and work around it."" ""We’’ll continue to be COVID tested as we lead up to launch, because we, of course, don’t want to take that up to the International Space Station,"" he added. ""But where there’s a will there’s a way, and there’s been a will to make that happen, and we’re just proud to be a part of it."" NASA's administrator Jim Bridenstein echoed the astronauts' sentiments at a later news briefing Friday. ""These are different times, but it is also a time when we need to be doing amazing things as a nation and inspiring the entire world and that’s what we’re doing,"" Bridenstein said. Part of the reason the launch is so historic is that it makes the country no longer reliant on Russia for seats to space. ""It reestablishes an essential capability if the United States is really going to be the leading space-faring country in the world, it needs the ability to launch its own people with its own equipment from its own territory,"" Logsdon said. ""It removes an almost embarrassing dependence that has persisted for the last nine years."" SpaceX and Boeing have been competing to be the first to launch NASA astronauts to the ISS. Boeing's hyped-up, unmanned test flight for its Starliner spacecraft in late December, however, infamously did not go as planned as the spacecraft never ended up making it to the ISS. ""Most people three years ago would have said Boeing would be first, but it turns out SpaceX has made steady progress,"" Logsdon said. If next week's launch goes well, it could bring the Elon Musk-founded private spaceflight company closer to one of its goals of leading the space tourism industry, and eventually bringing private citizens to space. ""That's part of the business plan for SpaceX,"" Logsdon said, ""Is to make this capability available to paying customers, not just to NASA.""

2020-05-21,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-withdraw-us-key-arms-control-pact/story?id=70815149,Trump to withdraw US from another key arms control pact,"The Trump administration will withdraw the U.S. from another major arms control pact on Friday, according to President Donald Trump. It's the latest agreement that the White House is pulling out of, senior U.S. officials say, because Russia is not complying, and China is not participating -- all which is further dismantling the international arms control regime and fueling concern about a new nuclear arms race. The Open Skies Treaty permits each signatory to conduct a set number of unarmed reconnaissance flights with sensor equipment over other member states at short notice, allowing them to collect data on military forces and quelling fears of secretive military build-ups. The data collected on the flight, which includes representatives of the surveilling and surveilled countries, is to be shared with all the signatories. This makes the treaty particularly important for U.S. allies in Europe who don't have the sophisticated satellites the U.S. has. But Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Thursday that Russia had failed to meet its obligations and the U.S. would notify its withdrawal on Friday. It will then begin a six-month wind-down period. While Pompeo said the U.S. ""may"" stay in the pact if Russian behavior changes, the administration will instead begin focusing on new nuclear talks with Russia and China, according to special envoy for arms control Marshall Billingslea, who announced he is finalizing details for a meeting with his Russian counterpart soon. The decision was swiftly condemned by arms control advocates, who argued U.S. withdrawal is counter-productive and issues with Russian compliance should be dealt with through the treaty. The withdrawal is ""another retreat from international security cooperation,"" according to retired Ambassador Laura Kennedy, who served as U.S. envoy to the U.N.-affiliated Conference on Disarmament. ""In an age where we need allies more than ever, we are disastrously going it alone."" European allies like France and Germany have urged the U.S. to remain one of the pact's 35 members, pointing to the over 1500 successful flights since the treaty entered into force in 2002. ""While the intelligence and confidence building advantages are limited for the United States itself, they are very real for America's NATO allies,"" over a dozen former senior European defense officials said in a joint letter last week, adding, ""The political symbolism matters: U.S. withdrawal would prevent the United States from overflying Russia, but would leave Russia still able to overfly American military activities and installations in Europe. U.S. departure would also further weaken the international arms control architecture and be a further blow to any global sense of stability."" Senior Trump officials, however, said Russia had violated the terms of the pact and a broader spirit of ""cooperative security"" in recent years, pointing to Russia's invasion of Georgia and Ukraine where it continues to occupy territory, its deployment of a cruise missile system in violation of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty, and its use of Novichok nerve agent against a former spy in the U.K. in violation of the Chemical Weapons Convention. ""Russia has systematically destroyed conventional arms control in Europe,"" said special envoy Billingslea. ""If the other party is not holding up their end of the bargain, we do have the right to withdraw from the arrangement."" In particular, U.S. officials point to Russia's denial of flights over a military exercise last fall and limits on flights near territory seized from Georgia and over the Russian province Kaliningrad, which is separate from the rest of Russia and sandwiched between Poland and Lithuania. In response, the U.S. had limited flights over some sensitive areas in Hawaii and Alaska. ""What [Russia] has been saying is, 'Yes, you can fly anywhere you want and look at anything you like at any time, except for the things we don't wish you to see,' and that kind of selective limitation clearly cuts at the heart of the confidence-building that is the purpose of the Open Skies Treaty,"" said Assistant Secretary of State for International Security and Non-proliferation Christopher Ford. Russia ""has had no accountability for that, and we are now finally providing that kind of accountability."" Advocates of the pact point out that Russia recently approved of a joint flight by the U.S., Estonia, and Latvia over Kaliningrad earlier this year without those restrictions. Ambassador Jim Gilmore, Trump's envoy to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, also said in March that Russia will no longer raise an ""objection"" for flights ""over one of their major exercises."" While Ford dismissed those developments as not representative of Russia's view it can ""turn its obligations on and off like a light switch,"" experts say it's proof that the U.S. can negotiate with Moscow for improvements. ""These problems can and should be solved through professional, pragmatic diplomacy, not by abandoning treaty commitments,"" wrote President Ronald Reagan's long-time Secretary of State George Shultz, along with President Bill Clinton's Defense Secretary William Perry and former Democratic Sen. Sam Nunn, in a letter to Trump in March. Trump's first Defense Secretary James Mattis backed that view during his time as Pentagon chief, calling it ""an important mechanism for engaging with our allies and partners"" that ""contributes to greater transparency and stability."" In particular, he noted, it was critical to exposing Russia's military presence in eastern Ukraine in 2014, even as Moscow denied playing a role in the fighting there. Republican lawmakers, however, have backed Trump's decision, arguing that Russia gained more out of the pact while the U.S. can continue its surveillance through a network of advanced satellites. ""In terms of intelligence collection, Moscow needs the Open Skies treaty more than Washington, yet Moscow has refused to abide by the treaty's obligations,"" said Bradley Bowman, a former national security adviser to Senate Republicans who's now at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies think tank. But data compiled by researchers at the Institute for Peace Research and Security Policy in Germany shows the U.S. receives far fewer flights over its territory than it and its allies fly over Russia's. Some analysts also say Russia's surveillance capability outside the flights is advanced enough that they don't need them as much as U.S. officials believe -- but when they collect that information on their own, they aren't required to share it with the U.S. or other signatories. Advocates of the treaty also say its purpose is beyond collecting intelligence, but also about creating stability and collective security through transparency -- and by allowing Russian officials on board with Americans and other Europeans. That builds a ""normalizing, collegial routine which builds trust,"" according to Melissa Hanham, deputy director of the Open Nuclear Network. The administration also appears to have disregarded the law by failing to notify Congress of its intent to withdraw 120 days in advance of the formal notification. That could spark a new legal battle down the road, as the Senate has to approve by a two-thirds majority of any treaty's ratification -- and, some Democrats have recently argued, its withdrawal. ""Congress's role over treaty withdrawal has remained uncertain for far too long. Our founders intended that no U.S. president should have full control of treaty powers,"" said Sen. Ed Markey, D-Mass., Thursday, proposing new legislation to require Senate approval for any treaty withdrawal or ratification. Arms control advocates also fear what U.S. withdrawal from the Open Skies Treaty means for the last piece of nuclear arms control between the U.S. and Russia, New START, or Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty. It expires next February, and while the two sides have engaged in some talks, the Trump administration has indicated it does not want to extend the pact unless it involves China -- a proposition China has rejected. Billingslea announced Thursday that he and his Russian counterpart, Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov, are finalizing plans to begin negotiations as soon as possible. While he said their ""expectation is that the Chinese will likewise be at the table,"" he gave no indication that they have had steps toward that goal, saying instead, ""The Chinese have an obligation to negotiate with us in good faith.""",29,,,,10
2020-04-28,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/International/intel-report-warns-zoom-vulnerable-foreign-surveillance/story?id=70376203,Intel report warns Zoom could be vulnerable to foreign surveillance,"The Zoom videoconferencing platform, so popular with people forced to stay home because of the coronavirus pandemic, could be vulnerable to intrusions by foreign government spy services, including China, according to a federal intelligence analysis obtained by ABC News. The analysis urges organizations to carefully consider the risk if they should continue working with the system. The report was issued jointly by the Department of Homeland Security’s Cyber Mission and Counterintelligence Mission centers, and was distributed to law enforcement and government agencies around the country. It comes less than a month after the FBI’s Boston office warned that hackers were able to hijack or disrupt videoconferences in what has come to be known as “Zoom-bombing.” Hackers “likely will identify new or use existing vulnerabilities in Zoom to compromise user devices and accounts for further exploitation of corporate networks,” the notice says. Even security fixes don’t eliminate the concerns, analysts said, because “the patching process is undermined by … actors who often capitalize on delays and develop exploits based on the vulnerability and available patches.” A Zoom spokesperson told ABC News the company disagrees with the intelligence analysis and that it is “heavily misinformed, includes blatant inaccuracies about Zoom’s operations, and the authors themselves admit only ‘moderate confidence’ in their own reporting. We are disappointed the authors did not engage with Zoom to verify the accuracy of these claims and understand the real facts about Zoom.” Regarding previously reported security issues, the company said, ""We actively and quickly addressed specific security concerns as they were raised over the past few weeks.” DHS intelligence experts noted the popularity of Zoom has skyrocketed with the platform’s daily user base growing, according to company statistics, from 10 million a day to 200 million since December. While in the last six weeks, government stay-home orders have forced learning, government and business operations to migrate from physical spaces to the internet. “Zoom’s sudden immense growth and use across both public and private sector entities in combination with its highly publicized cybersecurity issues creates a vulnerable, target-rich environment,” the intelligence notice says. “Any organization currently using – or considering using – Zoom should evaluate the risk of its use.” Among the specific concerns laid out by analysts is the risk posed by some development work for Zoom that is done in China. Because of China’s strict intelligence and intellectual property rules, “China’s access to Zoom servers makes Beijing uniquely positioned to target US public and private sector users,” according to the document. “China’s unique position does not prevent other nation-states from using Zoom vulnerabilities to achieve their objectives.” And, analysts said, hackers could use Zoom’s system to deploy malware that could then make a third party’s computer system susceptible to a security breach. The Zoom spokesperson said that the company ""has layered safeguards, robust cybersecurity protection, and internal controls in place to prevent unauthorized access to data” and that its “developers in China do not have any access to Zoom’s production environment, the power or access to make substantive changes to our platform or the means to access any meeting content."" The spokesperson said Zoom's systems are ""designed to maintain geo-fencing around China ensuring that users outside of China do not have their meeting data routed through servers in China."" Additionally, paid Zoom customers ""are now able to further customize which data center regions their account can use for real-time meeting traffic,"" which allows them to ""opt in or out of specific data center locations,"" the spokesperson said. The spokesperson said that in addition to the use of cloud data centers globally, Zoom had 17 data centers ""around the world,” but only one is in China. ""All Zoom source code is stored and versioned in the United States,"" the spokesperson said. John Cohen, a former DHS acting undersecretary who used to oversee the department’s intelligence operations, said in general, “China, Russia and other hostile nations view the coronavirus as an opportunity to expand their intelligence-gathering efforts and they are actively targeting the private communications of those in government, the private sector, academia and others, who have increasingly turned to online communications."" “Private conversations using online communications and video conferencing apps are vulnerable to being intercepted by criminals and foreign intelligence operatives,"" said Cohen, a current ABC News contributor. ""Securing these platforms must be a priority especially since they are being used more frequently during the current public health crisis.”",3,,,,11
2020-03-17,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/Health/facing-coronavirus-pandemic-us-confronts-cyber-attacks/story?id=69653329,"Facing coronavirus pandemic, US confronts cyberattacks","The United States, already dealing with the coronavirus pandemic, is also being targeted for cyberattacks and foreign disinformation campaigns, as federal officials feared. Multiple sources confirmed to ABC News in recent days that both the efforts that slowed computer systems at the Health and Human Services Department Sunday night and the weekend rash of bogus text messages warning a national quarantine is imminent were the products of foreign actors or components of foreign governments or entities connected to them. ""We are seeing multiple disinformation campaigns right now,"" said one federal official briefed on the situation. The two types of cyber incidents are different, but both are aimed at sowing panic in the American population and feeding distrust in government, according to intelligence officials. Federal officials said the two most likely perpetrators are Russia and China, two nations with the sophistication, skill and desire to carry out such campaigns against the U.S. Tune into ABC at 1 p.m. ET and ABC News Live at 4 p.m. ET every weekday for special coverage of the novel coronavirus with the full ABC News team, including the latest news, context and analysis. In the case of the HHS incident, officials said outsiders deployed automated users -- called bots -- to target the public-facing computer system. A source familiar with the investigation into the incident told ABC News that it is thought to be either a widespread campaign to scan HHS systems for vulnerabilities, or possibly a ""clumsy"" attempt to paralyze public online systems with a flood of visitors, something called distributed denial of service, or DDOS. ""When you're dealing with something like a denial of service attack on HHS during a pandemic, that's a very grave action for another country to take,"" Attorney General William Barr told The Associated Press Tuesday, confirming that an investigation is ongoing. ""So, if it is another country doing this, I'm sure the ramifications will be severe."" More insidious was the attack that began late last week in the New York City area and then broadened to Washington, D.C., Boston, Kansas and the West Coast where an entity infiltrated the cellphone MMS and SMS text-messaging system to send out realistic-looking warnings about an impending shutdown of public and government services because of the coronavirus outbreak. Sunday afternoon, suspicious texts made their way to medical staff in at least one department of a top hospital the Boston area, according to a recipient there. The person who had passed it along to the department said they had received the original message from an out-of-state ""friend,"" who was described as credible and had received the message from elsewhere. Texts were also received by doctors in at least one major hospital in San Francisco and by some members of the military around the country. In New York City, the messages spread like wildfire and told people to stock up on money and food because bridges, tunnels and mass transit would be shutting down. By the weekend, messages were pinging cellphones all over the nation's capital region saying that an unnamed friend's brother had come out of a meeting and that the president was poised to enact a national quarantine within days. The message instructed recipients to share it -- like a panic-inducing chain letter. Late Sunday night, one official told ABC News, ""It was a cyberattack -- we're trying to track and origin."" By Monday, the intelligence community, officials said, had determined the source was foreign and that the technique was sophisticated. The U.S. intelligence community is leading the effort to find the culprits; by law, agencies like the CIA are confined to working outside U.S. borders, making it clear that the government believes the perpetrators are connected to a foreign power. The attacks also confirmed the fears that U.S. officials voiced as worries of the coronavirus spread through government in the last two weeks. ""So much focus has been on meddling in the election,"" said one senior administration official involved in cyber defense. ""The goal of [foreign attackers] is really just creating instability in society and trying to erode trust in a situation like this, to drive messages -- frequently polar opposite messages -- to incite distrust and anger."" During a congressional hearing nearly two weeks ago, a top State Department official told members of the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on Department Management that the Russians have been spreading disinformation aggressively in connection with the global pandemic. Lea Gabrielle, head of the Global Engagement Center, told senators her agency's recent analysis shows ""accounts tied to Russia, the entire ecosystem of Russian disinformation has been engaged in the midst of this world health crisis. … It's well known at this point that there are false narratives out there around coronavirus."" At the same time, China's government has been aggressively pushing propaganda that blames the West for the pandemic, though the virus was first identified in Wuhan, the capital of China's Hubei province. Officials at the federal Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency told ABC News that the government ""has taken a number of steps over the last several weeks to increase cybersecurity preparedness across federal civilian agencies, including enhanced monitoring, issuing recommendations as agencies shift to telework, and identifying and protecting particularly important systems supporting COVID response efforts,"" said spokeswoman Sara Sendek.

2020-03-16,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/suspicious-cyberactivity-targeting-hhs-tied-coronavirus-response-sources/story?id=69619094,"Suspicious cyberactivity targeting HHS tied to coronavirus response, sources say","The Department of Health and Human Services experienced suspicious cyberactivity Sunday night related to its coronavirus response, administration sources confirmed to ABC News Monday. The suspicious activity HHS was not a hack but it may have been a distributed denial of service -- or DDOS -- attack, according to multiple sources. The distinction is important because there was no apparent breach of the HHS system, which could interfere with critical functions of the lead agency responding to the coronavirus contagion. A DDOS effort enlists automated users -- called bots -- to overwhelm a public-facing system in order to slow it down or even paralyze it. Officials believe any coordinated effort against HHS -- if there was one -- was not particularly successful and are satisfied that the system was not significantly affected. Nevertheless, the concern is that foreign actors might attempt to exploit the COVID-19 crisis to achieve some of their anti-American goals. “As federal state and local governments focus on handling the current public health crisis, national security officials are also tracking other threats -- in particular those posed by terrorist or extremist groups and foreign adversaries who may seek to take advantage of all of the attention being focused on the coronavirus and conduct an attack,” said John Cohen, a former acting Undersecretary of the Department of Homeland Security and contributor to ABC News. At this point, analysts are trying to determine the origin of the activity targeting HHS. Officials have told Congress that the intelligence community fears that entities connected to Russia would try to use the current situation to sow even more chaos in the American public. The FBI declined to comment. “We are aware of a cyber incident related to the Health and Human Services computer networks and the federal government is investigating this incident thoroughly,"" NSC spokesman John Ullyot said in the statement. ""HHS and federal government cybersecurity professionals are continuously monitoring and taking appropriate actions to secure our federal networks. HHS and federal networks are functioning normally at this time."" Intelligence and cyber officials are investigating to see if there is a connection to Sunday's messages saying there would be a national quarantine instituted, but as of now, they have not linked the two. The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), the Cyber Security arm of the Department of Homeland Security, is saying it is supporting its government partners, and is highlighting a number of steps that it's taken in previous weeks. “CISA will continue to support our partners at HHS as they protect their IT systems,"" CISA spokesperson Sara Sendek said in a statement. ""CISA has taken a number of steps over the last several weeks to increase cybersecurity preparedness across federal civilian agencies, including enhanced monitoring, issuing recommendations as agencies shift to telework, and identifying and protecting particularly important systems supporting COVID response efforts.

On Sunday, we became aware of a significant increase in activity on HHS cyber infrastructure and are fully operational as we actively investigate the matter. Early on while preparing and responding to COVID-19, HHS put extra protections in place. We are coordinating with federal law enforcement and remain vigilant and focused on ensuring the integrity of our IT infrastructure, HHS spokesperson Caitlin Oakley said in a statement.

2020-03-09,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/International/trial-suspects-shooting-flight-mh17-begins-netherlands/story?id=69480493,Trial of suspects in shooting down of flight MH17 begins in the Netherlands,"MOSCOW -- The trial of four men accused of involvement in the shooting down of Malaysian Airlines' flight MH17 over Ukraine in 2014 opened in a Dutch court on Monday, the first attempt to prosecute suspects over the disaster. Relatives of the 298 passengers and crew killed in the crash traveled to Schiphol, near Amsterdam, where the men-- three Russians and one Ukrainian-- will be tried. None of the accused were present in the courthouse; all are currently fugitives believed to be in Russia or eastern Ukraine. Malaysian Airlines Flight 17 was shot down on July 17, 2014, as it flew over an area of eastern Ukraine controlled by Russian-backed separatist rebels, who were fighting with Ukrainian government forces. It had been en route from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur. A years-long Dutch-led international investigation involving the four other countries most affected by the incident-- Malaysia, Australia, Ukraine, Belgium-- found that the plane was brought down by a Buk anti-aircraft missile belonging to a Russian army air defense brigade, which had sent the missile and its launcher into eastern Ukraine to assist the rebels. Last June, Dutch prosecutors said that the investigation had produced enough evidence to prosecute the four men, all commanders in the rebel forces, Igor Girkin, Sergey Dubinsky, Oleg Putlatov and Leonid Kharchenko. They are charged with the murder of the 298 victims and of causing the plane's crash. A panel of judges opened the hearing on Monday morning in the simple, wood-paneled courtroom. “Many people have long waited for this day,” presiding Judge Hendrik Steenhuis said in his opening remarks. “This tragic loss of so many lives has touched many all over the world."" He said the loss the victims' relatives had suffered was ""almost inconceivable."" It's not expected that any of the four defendants will be seen in the courtroom. Girkin, Dubinsky and Kharchenko have previously told reporters they will not be attending the trial and have denied any involvement in the shooting down. They will formally be tried in absentia. Oleg Pulatov, the fourth defendant, however, has taken on a defense team to represent him in the court to contest the charges, although he too will not appear. Russia claims no involvement The start of the trial opens a new stage in a long search for justice by the victims' families, many of whom have pleaded with Russia to admit its role in the disaster. Ahead of the first hearing, family members placed 298 empty white chairs outside Russia's embassy in the Netherlands. And on Monday, the prosecution began its opening statement by solemnly reading out each of the names of the dead. The trial is expected to last at least a year and will include testimonies from victims' relatives. So far, 49 relatives have requested to address the court, Judge Steenhuis said. “It is very important for us because nobody had expected there would be a trial at all,” Anton Kotti, who lost three family members in the disaster, told Reuters. “We hope the judge gets so much evidence that he can only come to one conclusion: ‘guilty’.” Russia has rejected any involvement in the incident and has refused to cooperate with the Dutch-led investigation. Russia's constitution prohibits it from extraditing its citizens, but in any case Russian officials have made clear they do not think the men should be tried. Ahead of the trial, Russia's foreign ministry spokeswoman, Maria Zakharova, accused the Dutch government of pressuring the court. She told the BBC in a television interview that she was ""100% sure that policy and politics is dominating."" For years Russian officials and state media have instead put out a series of alternative, often contradictory versions for the crash, which would push the blame onto Ukraine, while attacking the international investigation as biased. Russia's defense ministry early on published satellite images that were found to have been doctored to include a Ukrainian fighter jet close to the airliner. The Dutch prosecutor Ward Ferdinandusse on Monday warned in court that ""the smokescreen"" intended to confuse the case would likely continue. He quoted the famous Russian dissident writer Alexander Solzhenitsyn: ""Violence can only be concealed by lies. And lies can only maintain themselves through violence."" Airliner thought to be mistaken for Ukrainian military aircraft The prosecutions' case is based on the international investigation-- named the Joint Investigation Team or JIT-- which has produced voluminous evidence establishing a picture of the shooting down. Through witness statements, intercepted rebel radio communications, and analyses of hundreds of images and posts on social media, as well as satellite imagery, they have also been able to track the Russian missile's path as it was brought from Russia into eastern Ukraine and then launched from rebel-held territory. Investigations from independent journalists and researchers have coincided with the JIT's findings, which suggest the rebels accidentally shot down the airliner, mistaking it for a Ukrainian military aircraft. Intercepted radio communications released by the JIT appear to show the rebels celebrating after the shooting down of the plane, believing they had struck a Ukrainian military transport. Prosecutors on Monday said they did not believe that the four defendants had ""pressed the button"" that launched the missile that downed MH17. “However we do think that they played a significant co-ordinating role in the transportation and positioning of the Buk-TELAR and its removal back to Russia, making them so closely involved that they can be held responsible under criminal law for the downing of flight MH17,"" the prosecutor, Ferdinandusse told the court, using another name for the missile. Girkin, a former colonel from Russia's FSB intelligence service known by the nom-de-guerre Strelkov, or the Shooter, was a key separatist leader in the early days of the war, serving as the self-declared defense minister in the rebel-held Ukrainian city of Donetsk. Dubinsky and Pulatov have both served in Russia's military intelligence agency, the GRU, and were Girkin's deputy and intelligence chief during the shooting down. The Ukrainian suspect, Kharchenko, led a rebel combat unit. The investigation alleges that the men had requested Russia send the missile unit at a period when rebels were facing threats from Ukrainian warplanes. The court on Monday ruled the trial could go ahead with Igor Girkin, Sergei Dubinsky and Leonid Kharchenko being tried in absentia, noting that it was clear from their statements to the media they were all aware they were being sought for trial and that significant efforts had been made to reach them. “Despite knowledge of criminal prosecution, it may be assumed that they have waived their right to be present,"" Judge Steenhuis said. In Moscow in recent months, Girkin has told several reporters from international media organisations, including the BBC, that he does not recognize the Dutch court's jurisdiction. The Dutch lawyers for Pulatov told the court they had not yet had sufficient time to study the prosecutions’ case materials. But they suggested their defense would focus on the question of whether Ukraine had failed to close its airspace adequately at the time of the shooting down. They said a failure to answer that question would put in doubt the basis for prosecuting the suspects in a Dutch court. Pulatov, they said, denied involvement ""in any capacity"" in airliner's crash. The trial, perhaps one of the most significant international criminal trials since the Yugoslav war crimes tribunals, has the potential for significant diplomatic fallout and may yet hold more embarrassing revelations about the Kremlin's involvement in MH17's shooting down and, more broadly, about its covert war in eastern Ukraine. The JIT investigators have already released audio recordings of rebel communications that appeared to show the role of top Russian officials, including defense minister Sergey Shoigu and the head of state security agency FSB, Alexander Bortnikov, in organizing the rebels' command structures and supplying weapons and equipment. The Netherlands and Australia's governments have made clear to Russia that they hold it responsible for the shooting down. Dozens of relatives have signed open letters calling on Russian president Vladimir Putin to acknowledge Russia's role and to cease the disinformation campaign around the disaster.",13,,,,26
2020-02-27,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/International/chechen-exile-survives-suspected-assassination-attempt-fighting-off/story?id=69254729,Chechen exile survives suspected assassination attempt after fighting off attacker,"A prominent Chechen blogger and critic of the region’s leader Ramzan Kadyrov has survived a suspected assassination attempt after fighting off a man he said attacked him in his apartment in Poland. Tumso Abdurakhmanov posted a video on Wednesday night showing himself looking shaken and standing over a man on the floor of the apartment lying in a pool of blood. Abdurakhmanov, who is breathing hard, asks the man, ""Who sent you?"" and then shows a hammer which he says the man tried to kill him with. The man replies he came ""from Moscow"" and that ""they have my mother,"" possibly implying he may have been compelled to undertake the attack. The Sweden-based Chechen rights group, Vayfond, described the incident in a statement Wednesday as an ""assassination attempt."" It said that the man had broken into the apartment intending to bludgeon Abdurakhmanov while he slept, but that he had woken up and fought off the attacker before calling the police. Abdurakhmanov’s brother has told Kavkazskii Uzel, a website focused on the North Caucasus, that Abdurakhmanov and the attacker have both been hospitalized. Abdurakhmanov suffered only minor injuries and was under police guard, according to the outlet. The suspected attack is the latest in a string of recent attacks targeting Chechen opponents of Kadyrov living in exile in Europe. At the beginning of this month, another Chechen blogger, Imran Aliev, was found stabbed to death in a hotel room in the northern French city, Lille. In August, a former Chechen rebel commander, Zelimkhan Khangoshvili was shot dead in a park in Berlin by a gunman in an attack German authorities have linked to the Russian and Chechnya security services. Chechen exiles believe the attacks are being carried out on the orders of Kadyrov and his circle, who have long been accused of brutal repression in Chechnya, a predominantly Muslim republic in southern Russia. Kadyrov, who was appointed by Russian President Vladimir Putin in 2007, has ruled the republic with an iron fist and his security forces are accused of using torture and extrajudicial killings against opponents. Recently, Kadyrov's forces have been accused of conducting purges against LGBT people in Chechnya. Abdurakhmanov is perhaps Kadyrov’s most prominent critic. He runs a YouTube channel with 250,000 subscribers, where he criticizes the violence and alleged corruption of Kadyrov and his officials. Abdurakhmanov fled Chechnya in 2015 after a conflict with a senior Chechen official and has sought asylum in Poland. The country rejected his request in 2018, a decision that was criticized by Amnesty International that said he faced a real threat of torture if he returned to Chechnya. Last March, a member of Chechnya’s parliament and one of Kadyrov’s top lieutenants, Magomed Daudov, publicly declared a ""blood feud"" against Abdurakhmanov, accusing him of being a ""traitor"" to his people. In a now deleted live broadcast on Instagram, Daudov, who is known by the nom de guerre 'Lord,' addressed Abdurakhmanov: ""From now on, when you go to bed, make sure that you lock the door with a key. When you go outside, be vigilant. If you get a kick in the back, know that it’s no accident."" At the time, Abdurakhmanov told The Associated Press that he took Daudov’s threats seriously. ""I take Daudov’s words very seriously,"" Abdurakhmanov told the AP. ""He is a person who has the power to follow through on his threats."" Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov on Thursday said he was ""not inclined"" to link the assault on Abdurakhmanov with his criticism of Kadyrov, saying Russian citizens can be attacked for a variety of reasons. ""It's grounds for sympathy, but I don't think this is a significant event for the Russian agenda,"" Peskov said during his daily briefing, according to the state news agency Tass. Chechens living in exile have expressed fears they could be targeted by forces loyal to Kadyrov, even in Europe. In 2019, several gay men who had fled Chechnya amid the roundups of LGBT people, told ABC News they worried they could be attacked if they were identified and some have said they received threats via messengers. Several Chechens have been shot dead in Istanbul over the last decade in killings that Turkish authorities suspect were linked to the Russian security services. In 2009, Kadyrov’s former bodyguard was killed by a gunman in Vienna after publicly alleging he had been personally tortured by Kadyrov. Kadyrov’s circle has also been linked to the murder of Boris Nemtsov, the Russian opposition leader who was gunned down in 2015 close to the Kremlin. A Moscow court in 2017 convicted five Chechen men of the murder, including a former officer belonging to an elite Chechen paramilitary unit. Nemtsov’s family have accused the authorities of a deliberate cover up after investigators were blocked from questioning an influential Chechen official close to Kadyrov, who has been accused of playing a role in ordering the assassination. This weekend marks the five year anniversary of Nemtsov’s death.",13,,,,24
2020-02-21,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/International/hysteria-coronavirus-sparks-violent-protests-ukraine/story?id=69124337,Hysteria over coronavirus sparks violent protests in Ukraine,"Hysteria over the novel coronavirus epidemic has sparked violent protests in Ukraine, fueled by panic and disinformation around the outbreak -- even though the country has no confirmed cases of the virus. Protests and violent clashes with police broke out in several places Thursday, as Ukraine's authorities blamed the disorder on the spread of misinformation on social media and suggested it may have been part of a deliberate campaign targeting the country. The trouble began as a plane carrying evacuees from China landed in Ukraine on Thursday. In a village in central Ukraine, where the evacuees were due to be taken to a health spa to be quarantined, local people began attacking police and tried to blockade the convoy carrying the evacuees. Residents at the village of Novi Sanzhary set alight tires and barricaded the road to the spa, before attacking the convoy with the evacuees onboard. Windows on some of the buses were smashed. Hundreds of helmeted riot officers battled with the protesters and used armored vehicles to clear tractors from the road. The fighting carried on late into the night, with 24 people arrested, police said. Nine police offices and one civilian were injured. In other towns, people blockaded entries to local hospitals, fearing the evacuees might be diverted to them. The disorder occurred as a wave of speculation online spread suggesting that the first cases of the virus may have arrived in Ukraine, including what appeared to be a deliberate disinformation campaign. Namely, an email claiming to be from the Ukraine health ministry asserted that Ukraine now had 5 confirmed cases of the virus. In reality, the email, which was sent to the ministry's entire contact list, was fake, Ukraine's security service, the SBU, said in a statement. The email had come from outside the country, the agency said, and the agency was investigating who was behind it. There are no confirmed cases of the virus in Ukraine. The only two Ukrainians to be infected were aboard the Diamond Princess cruise liner in Japan and have already now recovered. Authorities were forced to counter the misinformation. Ukraine's Center of Public Health published a message warning that the reports of infections were fake and asked the media not to spread it. ""Attention! The reports about five confirmed cases of COVID-19 coronavirus in Ukraine are UNTRUE,"" the Center for Public Health said in a statement, referring to the virus by its scientific name. ""We urge the media not to disseminate this information and to inform the press service of the Health Ministry of Ukraine of the sender of this information upon receipt of the letter."" Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy issued a statement urging calm and that there was no public health risk. The country's health minister, Zoryana Skaletska, promised on Thursday to spend the two-week quarantine period with the evacuees to prove there was no danger. The evacuees -- 45 Ukrainians, 27 Argentinians and citizens from several other South American countries, as well as 22 crew members and doctors -- were flown to Ukraine from China's Hubei Province. All of them have already tested negative for the virus, authorities said, but are to be held in quarantine to ensure they aren't carrying it. It was unclear where the fake email originated from or how significant its role was in fueling the disorder, but on Friday, Prime Minister Oleksiy Honcharuk said he believed the disorder was the result of a deliberate campaign. In a country that is frequently the victim of Russian disinformation campaigns and major cyber attacks, that has meant some in Ukraine quickly turned their suspicions towards Moscow. ""Those events which happened yesterday, in my opinion, are the consequences also of the information war that is continuing against our country both inside and from without,"" Honcharuk, who was dispatched to Novi Sanzhary to deal with the rioting, told Ukraine's parliament on Friday. In Ukraine, ""information war"" most often refers to efforts by Russia to destabilize the country, alongside its military actions in eastern Ukraine. Zelenskiy, however, on Friday appeared to lay the blame on those giving in to panic. ""Frankly speaking, we constantly say that Ukraine is Europe. Yesterday in several episodes, it seemed more like we are Europe of the Middle Ages,"" Zelenskiy said. ""Let's not forget that we are, all the same, people and not…,"" he said, saying he didn't want to use a bad word. Ukraine's security service in its statement said it had already established the email had been sent from a foreign provider and that the sender's address had been altered. Misinformation around the novel coronavirus has boomed around the world since outbreak began. In Ukraine, where trust in the health system and authorities is weak, false reports about the virus quickly spread online. Besides the clashes in Novi Sanzhary, people also sought to block access to a hospital in the western Lviv region, burning cars and tires to create a roadblock. In Ternopil, another western city, a crowd gathered with a priest outside a health spa to pray that Ukrainians returning from China would not be brought there. There are around 1,300 confirmed cases of the virus outside China, which has registered around 75,600 within its borders. The total death toll for the virus is 2,247. Chinese health authorities on Thursday reported a drop in the number of new infections, though there was a jump in cases in South Korea, where they rose by a hundred in a single day to reach 204.",17,,,,20
2020-01-17,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/pentagon-decide-troop-cut-west-africa/story?id=68342094,Pentagon to decide soon on possible troop cut in West Africa,"ABOARD A U.S. MILITARY AIRCRAFT -- A Pentagon decision that could lead to a reduction in the number of U.S. troops in West Africa could come within four to eight weeks, according to Gen. Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The possible troop cut has drawn concerns that it could come at a time when the threat in the region from violent extremist groups is growing. For months, U.S. Africa Command (AFRICOM) has been reassessing the mission priorities of the 5,200 troops currently stationed in Africa, part of a worldwide review by U.S. military commands to determine whether some missions should be cut in scope to realign their forces, resources and capabilities with the military's strategic focus on China and Russia. The main focus of AFRICOM's review has been on the hundreds of American troops operating in West Africa who are providing logistical, intelligence and special operations support to the French military mission against Islamic extremist groups operating in Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso. Once AFRICOM's review is concluded Defense Secretary Mark Esper is expected to decide whether to accept the command's recommendations that may or may not include a possible troop cut in western Africa. ""I'd expect realistically that the AFRICOM review will be over and we'll probably get secretary-level decisions -- hard decisions, my guess is -- in a month or two maybe, maximum, maybe six weeks,"" Milley told reporters with him as he flew back to the United States from Europe, where he held meetings with his NATO counterparts. News reports earlier this week that a U.S. troop withdrawal could occur sparked concerns from French officials. A French presidential source told Agence France-Presse that the U.S. made ""irreplaceable"" contributions to its operations in west Africa, particularly with intelligence gathering and mid-air refueling. ""We would not be able to get these from other partners, especially when it comes to intelligence,"" said the official, who added that France would be sharing its concerns with the U.S. ""at all levels."" Milley said the U.S. is working with the French to determine whether the level of support the U.S. is providing France is ""too much, too little, is it about right, and is it the right capabilities."" But the nation's top military officer pushed back on the notion that ""we are pulling out of Africa."" ""I think that's a mischaracterization and an overstatement,"" said Milley. ""The proper term would be economy of force, which doesn't mean zero,"" he added. ""It just means you've got to right-size it to the tasks and the threats at a level of effort that's appropriate to achieve your objectives."" As the National Defense Strategy prioritizes the U.S. military's focus on China and Russia, other geographic areas where the U.S. has operated in are becoming ""economy of force"" areas. ""Economy of force means you are going to use the least amount of force to achieve the minimum amount of objectives that you can achieve in support of the broader main effort,"" said Milley. Milley said one question being asked by military officials conducting the review is whether the U.S. should be the one providing all the military support in the region. ""We certainly have capabilities, but the question is should they be applied or not,"" said Milley. ""Maybe there are other countries that have the same types of capabilities that are not contributing that could contribute."" The majority of AFRICOM's 5,200 military personnel are serving at a base in the east African country of Djibouti where the U.S. supports Somalia's fight against the al-Qaeda affiliated al-Shabaab terror group. The U.S. military presence in western Africa had historically involved the rotation of small numbers of U.S. troops helping to train local militaries. But that all changed when France intervened in Mali in 2013 to push back Islamic extremists who seemed poised to overthrow that country's government. The United States quickly provided intelligence and logistical support to the original French mission. Since then, Africa Command has regularly deployed small teams of U.S. special operations forces to the region, primarily advising and assisting the Nigerien military. The number of American troops in western Africa peaked at 800 as the U.S. expanded a remote desert airstrip in Niger and turned it into a hub for drones used in intelligence-gathering missions around the region. But America's growing military role remained little-known until October 2017, when four U.S. Army special operations soldiers were killed in an ambush. As a result of that incident, U.S. Africa Command increased the force protection and the resourcing of American military teams operating in western Africa. U.S. Africa Command is the first of the U.S. military's regional commands to undertake the worldwide review of missions. Those responsible for South America, Europe, the Middle East and Asia will soon be undertaking their own reviews.",14,,,,3
2020-01-09,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/election-security-officials-brace-iran-cyber-retaliation/story?id=68174632,Election security officials brace for possible Iran cyber retaliation,"With tensions between Washington and Tehran on the rise, election security officials are warning of possible retaliation from Iran in the form of election meddling -- a familiar threat in the wake of Russia’s efforts in the 2016 presidential election. “The thing I’m most worried about are a repeat of some of the types of attacks we say in 2016 against larger election infrastructure,” said Matt Blaze, a Georgetown University Law Center professor, during a Thursday hearing before the Committee on House Administration. “A determined adversary who wanted to disrupt our elections would have a frighteningly easy task.” As the presidential primary season gets underway, the threat of Iranian interference highlights efforts by the federal government and states since 2016 -- when Russian hackers successfully infiltrated voting systems -- to shore up their defenses. Last week, after the death of Gen. Qassem Soleimani, the head of Iran's elite Quds Force, leaders in Tehran vowed to seek revenge. As ABC News and others have previously reported, Iran is capable of targeting a broad range of public and private institutions with cyber intrusions and attacks. State and federal leaders have already raised warnings, including West Virginia Secretary of State Mac Warner, who released a statement this week highlighting how tensions with Iran raise the stakes in securing voter systems. “The world we live in today is one where asymmetric warfare is the norm, and cyberattacks have become the weapon of choice for rogue regimes like Iran,"" Warner said. “Soleimani's death amplifies our state's preparations.” Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger echoed in a statement of his own that Iran’s “latest warning serves as a reminder that we can never lower our guard.” Neither state has reported receiving credible threats, but their statements illustrate how election security leaders are taking notice of Iran’s announced intentions to retaliate. State officials across the map have been in touch with the Department of Homeland Security's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), which convened a briefing phone call with cyber stakeholders around the country after the Soleimani strike last week. Acting Secretary of Homeland Security Chad Wolf met with CISA Director Chris Krebs on Thursday to discuss “election security and resilience” as part of the effort to defend against Iran’s potential cyber activities, according to DHS. Maria Benson, a spokeswoman with the National Association of Secretaries of State, told ABC News earlier this week that states have also been “diligently shoring up election security and defenses since 2016 against malicious actors, regardless of country.” Government officials have cited the need to coordinate with private companies who provide counties and voting districts with voting equipment to protect elections. During Thursday’s hearing before the Committee on House Administration, chiefs from the three largest private election system vendors described efforts they’ve made to “mitigate risks” from malign foreign actors to compromise their systems. “We spend great deal of time” securing systems from foreign hacks, said Tom Burt, the CEO at Election Security & Systems. “Our effort, I can honestly say, is as strong as we are capable of. We are always looking to find ways to improve and partner with other agencies improve our ability to mitigate any risks.” The cybersecurity threat in elections first emerged in 2016, when U.S. officials said Russian hackers likely targeted systems in all 50 states -- what some compared to rattling door handles -- and said that some were able to get through. In two Florida counties, for example, Russian hackers were able to successfully infiltrate voter databases. While there was no evidence any of the data was tampered with in 2016, the incident raised alarm bells with lawmakers. The Senate Intelligence Committee investigated and concluded that the “Russian movement directed extensive activity, beginning in at least 2014 and carrying into at least 2017, against U.S. election infrastructure' at the state and local level.” Since then, security officials and experts said the U.S. has made significant progress in protecting the voting process, but there's much more work to be done before Americans cast their ballots in 2020. ""There's a lot of things that keep me up at night,"" a DHS official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, told ABC News last year. ""What could our adversaries do? What could they do to undermine our democratic system?... I'll certainly be nervous but confident in the lines of communication we have and the steps that we've taken.""

2019-12-20,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/International/russia-names-shooter-attack-spy-headquarters/story?id=67850611,Russia names shooter in attack on spy headquarters,"MOSCOW -- Russian authorities have named the suspected gunman who opened fire on the headquarters of the country's Federal Security Services in central Moscow on Thursday, a rare attack that killed two FSB agents and wounded several others. The Investigative Committee, which handles serious crimes, on Friday identified the alleged attacker as 39-year-old Yevgeny Manyurov, a resident of Podolsk, a town close to Moscow. Police said they fatally shot Manyurov during the Thursday evening attack near the FSB headquarters, known as the Lyubyanka. Manyurov opened fire at officers close to the building's main entrance before taking shelter nearby and continuing to rake the side of the headquarters with automatic fire. One FSB officer was killed at the scene, and on Friday the Investigative Committee said a second officer had died in the hospital after succumbing to his injuries from the attack. Four others agents were injured as well as a civilian, the committee said in a statement. Several Russian media outlets had already named Manyurov as the shooter, citing unnamed law enforcement sources, and posted grisly photographs of what they said was his body after he had been killed by police. Manyurov's parents have told Russian media that he had worked as a security guard and neighbors on Friday described him as a gun enthusiast. His name appears on the website of a Moscow shooting academy, where he is listed as having placed third in a pistol caliber carbine competition in November. His father, Fitikh Manyurov, told the news outlet RBC that his son had recently been working as a security guard for the embassy of the United Arab Emirates in Moscow. Neighbors on Friday told Reuters that the FSB had raided Manyurov's apartment in Podolsk, where he lives with his mother, in the early hours. The authorities have still not offered any motive for the attack and so far have not classified it as terrorism. The Investigative Committee has opened a criminal case on charges of attempting to take the life of law enforcement officers and in its statement on Friday said it was still establishing why Manyurov had carried out the shooting. In interviews with Russian media, Manyurov's parents painted a picture of a loner interested in guns and sports. Oleg Solovich, a trainer at the gun academy where Manyurov practiced, told the tabloid Komsomolskaya Pravda that Manyurov had only taken up shooting recently and Manyurov had liked to shoot while still wearing his coat. The attack struck at the heart of Russia’s feared security services. The Lyubyanka, which served as the headquarters for the Soviet KGB, has long been a symbol of Russia’s police state, a site where people were tortured and shot under Joseph Stalin. The building is located less than a mile from the Kremlin and in a busy shopping district. There was speculation that the attack might have been timed to coincide with the FSB’s main holiday, the Day of the Security Services, which fell on Friday. Even as the shooting was unfolding, Russian President Vladimir Putin, a former head of the FSB himself, was attending a gala concert in the Kremlin celebrating members of the security services. The attack also occurred on the same day that Putin held his annual end-of-year press conference, a major media spectacle and key event for Putin, where he takes questions from hundreds of journalists. Russia endures major terrorist attacks fairly frequently and the threat has intensified since its military intervention in Syria in 2015. But while other cities have been struck by bombings and shootings, Moscow has not suffered a major incident for several years, a fact authorities normally attribute to the security services which they say break up dozens of plots each year.",3,,,,24
2019-12-19,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/International/injured-shooting-federal-security-service-building-moscow-reports/story?id=67826446,Gunman opens fire on Russian spy headquarters in Moscow,"MOSCOW -- A gunman opened fire at the headquarters of Russia's Federal Security Service in central Moscow on Thursday, killing at least one FSB agent and seriously injuring several others in a rare attack that struck at the heart of the country's feared security apparatus. The attacker began shooting near the FSB building, known as the Lyubyanka, according to a statement from the agency, which is located around half a mile from the Kremlin in a busy shopping district. Roughly an hour after the shooting began, the agency said the gunman had been ""neutralised"" and there were several casualties. At least five people were wounded in the shooting, Russian state news agencies reported, citing the country's health ministry, among them FSB agents and police officers. At least one FSB employee was reported to have been killed, according to TASS. The FSB said it was now trying to establish the identity of the shooter, but gave few details beyond a terse statement. Videos from the scene posted by local media showed people running as the sound of of gunshots rang out. Other videos appeared to show the outside of the FSB building being raked with automatic gunfire. Eyewitnesses shot phone videos of heavily armed police huddled near the building and officers in helmets and body armor running toward it. Some media reports initially suggested three attackers may have been involved. The FSB later said that was incorrect and that the gunman had been alone. Dozens of police cars and fire engines cordoned off the building following the attack, with journalists and onlookers gathering to watch. A bomb disposal unit arrived after reports that the attacker may have been carrying explosives. Authorities so far have not publicly commented on the attacker's motive. A spokesman for the Investigative Committee of Russia told Interfax that a case has been opened under article 317 of the criminal code, which involves an attempt on the life of law enforcement officers, but did not say whether terrorism was being considered. Russian President Vladimir Putin had been informed about the attack, his spokesman Dmitry Peskov told Interfax. The shooting is exceptional for Moscow, striking at a key symbol of the security services, which Putin-- a former FSB director himself-- has placed at the center of his rule. The Lyubyanka served as the headquarters of the Soviet-era KGB and a site where the secret police under Joseph Stalin carried out torture and killings. The FSB is the main successor agency to the KGB and under Putin has become the most powerful of the country's security agencies, possessed of vast manpower and tasked with preventing terrorist attacks as well as maintaining political control in the country. The attack also occurred the day before the FSB marks its main national holiday, the Day of the Security Services. Putin was addressing veterans of the security services at a ceremony less than a mile away in the Kremlin as the attack was unfolding. Speaking at the ceremony, Putin said the security services had successfully thwarted 33 terror plots this year. Russia has long suffered terrorist attacks and the threat from Islamic terror groups has intensified following Moscow's military intervention in Syria in 2015. But while bombings and shooting have occurred in other cities, Moscow has not been hit for several years, a fact authorities normally attribute to the security services which they say break up dozens of plots each year. The gunfire also erupted just hours after one of Putin's biggest events of the year-- his marathon end-of-year press conference where he takes questions from hundreds of journalists for hours at a time. During the event this year, Putin said that two devastating terrorist attacks in the early parts of his rule had been the worst moments of his 20-year rule.",3,,,,24
